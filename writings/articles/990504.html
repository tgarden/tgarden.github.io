<H2><CENTER>NATO at 50 - A sombre summit</CENTER></H2>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	It turned out to be a very different celebration in Washington
at the end of April than the one that had originally been planned to
mark NATO's half century. For the past two years, staffs had been
working to put together an agenda which would give a new sense of
purpose to the Alliance for the future. The strategic concept, that
had been agreed in 1991 after the end of the Cold War, was in dire
need of a rewrite to reflect the new world order. The United States
was keen to see NATO acting more pro-actively to bring peace and
security beyond the immediate territories of the member nations. Some
Europeans were less enthusiastic about a  move away from the classic
collective security rationale for NATO. The United States was also
pushing hard for a more robust posture to counter the proliferation
of weapons of mass destruction around the world. The birthday party
would also in part be a celebration of the accession of the three new
members (Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic). Some European
nations had been pressing for announcements on a further tranche of
new members, but there was little enthusiasm from the United States
or the United Kingdom.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	In the event, the Summit was totally dominated by the Alliance
operations against Serbia. The launching of the air campaign had
overtaken the development of a new strategic concept for NATO.
Perhaps rather to the surprise a number of Alliance members,  it had
proved possible to get the governments of the 19 nations to agree to
conduct a full scale air offensive against another European state,
without a specific UN security council resolution authorising the use
of military force. The Washington Summit of NATO heads of government
met one month into the bombing campaign. In the first month of
Operation Allied Force, events had changed NATO's original war aims.
The acceleration of the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo had produced a
refugee humanitarian crisis. The many tales of atrocities to the
ethnic Albanians by Serb military and police forces had strengthened
the political will within NATO. The failure of the bombing to bring
Milosevic back to the negotiating table in first few days was causing
both politicians and commentators to ask what happens if NATO has to
secure Kosovo without an agreement from Serbia.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	The question of the circumstances under which NATO ground
forces would move into Kosovo has become a growing issue. In the
first week of the air campaign, NATO's leaders were strong in their
statements that ground forces would only be used after an agreement
had been made with all parties including the Serbian government.
Commentators (including the writer) criticised this policy on two
grounds. First, all military campaigns should be planned with 
appropriate provision for the worst case. The air campaign might work
on its own, but no one could be sure until it was tried. Since it
would take two or three months to assemble an appropriate ground
force in the region, the prudent military planner would want to start
building up such a force from the start of the bombing. Secondly, it
was clear from experience in Bosnia and during the Kosovo
negotiations, that the risk of loss of territory was the strongest
lever available to change behaviour in the Serbian leadership. Thus
it weakened the West's negotiating position if the taking of Kosovo
territory by force was discounted from the start. It has been
interesting to watch how the political language has changed as the
potential need for ground forces has dawned on NATO's political
leadership. By week three, George Robertson, the Defence Secretary,
was talking about the need for a permissive environment before NATO
ground forces were put in  to Kosovo. In the run up to the NATO
summit, the British Government was explaining that ground forces
would go in only when the Serbian forces were sufficiently degraded.
Tony Blair arrived early for the Washington Summit, and used the
opportunity to make it clear that he was prepared to go all the way
in this operation, and was looking for the rest of NATO to follow.
Unfortunately, the leaders at the Summit did little to advance this
option, and since then we have, if anything, seen a cooling in the
talk of a ground option.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	So what ultimately was achieved at the Washington Summit? Aside
from the very important discussions about the next steps in Kosovo
operation, the NATO leaders agreed on a number of strategic
priorities for the long term future of the Alliance. Most of these
were lost to the wider public in the noise of reporting about
Operation Allied Force. The official summit communique was summed up
as: <I>"NATO says it will expand its numbers and its functions"</I>. 
</P>

<P>It announced that the 19 member countries had:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>  approved an updated Strategic Concept;
   
   <LI>reaffirmed the commitment to the enlargement process of the
   Alliance and approved a Membership Action Plan for countries
   wishing to join;
   
   <LI>completed the work on key elements of the Berlin Decisions on
   building the European Security and Defence Identity within the
   Alliance and decided to further enhance its effectiveness;
   
   <LI>launched the Defence Capabilities Initiative;
   
   <LI>intensified relations with Partners through an enhanced and
   more operational Partnership for Peace and strengthened
   consultations and co-operation within the Euro-Atlantic
   Partnership Council
   
   <LI>enhanced the Mediterranean Dialogue;
   
   <LI>decided to increase Alliance efforts against weapons of mass
   destruction and their means of delivery.
</UL>

<P>These seven elements are all important for the future of NATO. 
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The Strategic Concept is an 18 page document, which recognises the
changes in the strategic environment since the 1991 concept was
produced. The main elements are:</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
   <LI><B>Collective Defence</B>: The Strategic Concept underscores
   the enduring core mission of NATO as the collective defence of its
   members under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty.
   
   <LI><B>Military Capabilities</B>: The Concept reaffirms Allies'
   determination to strengthen Alliance defence capabilities by
   ensuring forces that are more mobile, sustainable, survivable and
   able to engage effectively on the full spectrum of NATO missions.
   
   <LI><B>New Missions</B>: The Concept calls for improvements in
   NATO's capability to undertake new missions to respond to a broad
   spectrum of possible threats to Alliance common interests,
   including: regional conflicts, such as in Kosovo and Bosnia; the
   proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of
   delivery; and transnational threats like terrorism.
   
   <LI><B>New Members:</B> The Concept underscores NATO's continued
   openness to  new members and Allies' commitment to enlargement as
   part of a broader effort to enhance peace and stability throughout
   the Euro-Atlanticcommunity.
   
   <LI><B>Strengthened Partnerships:</B> The Concept reinforces
   Alliance effortsto build wide-ranging partnerships with the aim of
   increasingtransparency and mutual confidence in security matters
   and enhancing the capacity of allies and partners to act together.
   
   <LI><B>European Capabilities</B>: The Concept highlights
   development of a European Security and Defense Identity within
   NATO as an essentialelement of NATO's ongoing adaptation, enabling
   European allies to make a more effective contribution to
   Euro-Atlantic security.
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Looking to further enlargement, the assistance received from
the "front-line states" for the Kosovo crisis was rewarded by
singling out  Macedonia and Albania for special thanks, while also
congratulating Romania, Slovenia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,
Bulgaria and Slovakia for progress made since the Madrid summit. As
the communique says: <I>"No European democratic country whose
admission would fulfil the objectives of the Treaty will be excluded
from consideration.</I>" There is little doubt that there will be
some debts to be repaid in terms of accelerated admission to NATO
after Kosovo.</P>

<P>	On the arms control front, the communique said that: <I>" Arms
control, disarmament, and non-proliferation will continue to play a
major role in the achievement of the Alliance's security
objectives."</I>  However for those that were perhaps looking for an
withdrawal  of US nuclear forces from Europe, the Strategic Concept
makes it clear that there will be a continuing need. </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>"To protect peace and to prevent war or any kind of
coercion, the Alliance will maintain for the foreseeable future an
appropriate mix of nuclear and conventional forces based in Europe
and kept up to date where necessary, although at a minimum sufficient
level.  Taking into account the diversity of risks with which the
Alliance could be faced, it must maintain the forces necessary to
ensure credible deterrence and to provide a wide range of
conventional response options. But he Alliance's conventional forces
alone cannot ensure credible deterrence. Nuclear weapons make a
unique contribution in rendering the risks of aggression against the
Alliance incalculable and unacceptable. Thus, they remain essential
to preserve peace."</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	In looking at the required characteristics for nuclear forces,
the Concept emphasises the need for  <I>"widespread participation by
European Allies involved in collective defence planning in nuclear
roles, in peacetime basing on their territory and in command, control
and consultation arrangements. Nuclear forces based in Europe and
committed to NATO provide an essential political and military link
between the European and the North American members of the
Alliance."</I> The concept also argues for a continuing need for
sub-strategic nuclear forces based in Europe. These will be provided
by dual capable aircraft and a small number of UK Trident warheads. 
Nevertheless, pressure for a re-examination of what nuclear forces
are really necessary now led to a potentially important new
initiative. "<I>In the light of  overall strategic developments and
the reduced salience of nuclear weapons, the Alliance will consider
options for confidence and security building measures, verification,
non-proliferation and disarmament. The Council in Permanent Session
will propose a process to Ministers in December for considering such
options."</I>  Insiders  have suggested that this may lead to some
radical reductions.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	The summit had a very different tone from the celebration that
had been planned. The staff work to produce all these new initiatives
has been difficult over the past months. However the focus of NATO on
the current challenges of Kosovo in some ways eased the passage of
all these new undertakings. The leaders were clear that the new
Concept was being forged in the Balkans even as they were issuing the
communique on 24 April. If NATO is able to resolve Kosovo
satisfactorily over the coming months, the new Concept is likely to
be a good building block for the future. If NATO were to  fail, the
promises of the Washington Summit would be consigned to history, and
the future of the Alliance itself would be in question. </P>
