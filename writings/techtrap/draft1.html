<P><CENTER>BUYING SECURITY THROUGH TECHNOLOGY</CENTER></P>

<P>The advances of technology in the twentieth century have been
revolutionary in their impact on every nation. We can travel
throughout the world in a matter of hours. We can communicate
virtually instantaneously with anyone, wherever they may be. Complex
machines are manufactured automatically, and made from materials
which are unknown in nature. Behind all these tangible effects is the
deeper understanding of the nature of matter which the physicists,
chemists, biologists and mathematicians have given us through the
fruits of pure science research. At the same time this technological
progress has given us the nuclear warhead, the inter-continental
ballistic missile, biological and chemical warfare agents,
precision-guided munitions, supersonic jet bombers, nuclear-powered
submarines, and an endless choice of killing systems for conducting
war. The pace of technological innovation shows no signs of
slackening. An optimist would hope that the future enhancements in
both communications and wealth- producing capacity would offer the
prospect of a future of global harmony, with no competition for
resources, territory or power. At the same time, the remorseless
progress in military scientific achievement offers an increasing
range of more effective ways to wage war; and it does so to an ever
greater number of nations, ethnic groupings, dissidents and terrorist
organizations.</P>

<P>It is beyond the scope of this book to examine the global benefits
that technology may provide tomorrow. It is to be hoped that global
communication will improve understanding, that increasing
productivity will raise living standards everywhere, and that
renewable energy sources and new materials will reduce dependence on
strategic resources. Such a rosy technological future should allow
more harmonious international relations to develop, yet current
trends point to a more pessimistic prospect being equally valid. The
ability to threaten other nations' vital interests from great
distances, the imbalance between rich and poor nations being worsened
by a technology gap, the move towards ethnic based states and the
divergence of political systems, all suggest that security and peace
will need to be earned in the future, just as they have had to be in
the past.</P>

<P>In subsequent chapters we examine how technology affects the
maintenance of peace and security. Firstly, the key developments of
the past are highlighted in each of the military specialisations.
Then, the potential of each of the major areas of scientific interest
is reviewed. Finally, the possibilities for future of warfare are
explored. The influence of technology on warfare is not a new
concern. As each development in weapon design has been made, some new
response has been stimulated to act as a counter to the new
capability. It is often suggested that today the nature of the
problem is changing.</P>

<P>In the past, developments have for the most part been incremental
in nature. The significant breakthroughs such as aircraft, submarine,
machine gun, tank, missile and atomic bomb have taken years to come
to fruition and full deployment. Now we are told that technology is
leaping ahead in every research field: high energy physics,
computing, nuclear physics, space, chemistry, materials,
biotechnology, nanotechnology, mathematics and electronics. Not only
are all these fields experiencing new discoveries at rates which
appear exponential, but the rate of innovation in the military sphere
is faster than the production and development cycle can cope with. On
this basis new weapons become based on obsolete technology before
they enter operational service.</P>

<P>There are those who advocate comprehensive military research into
each and every new technological avenue of interest. It is argued
that to ignore the possibilities may open a new vulnerability, given
that potential adversaries may gain a decisive breakthrough in a
critical research area. It is also said that technology will
compensate for smaller armed forces, and ensure that casualties are
few. Such a massive commitment could only be achieved at enormous
cost in both financial and scientific resource terms. As is shown
later in this volume, many of the most exciting research areas need
vast investment over a long period with uncertain expectations of
success. The research scientists are themselves a finite resource,
and if used in one area are unavailable for other work in either the
civil or military areas. For most nations, it will be necessary to
allocate priorities on the best assessment of the balance of risk
against the financial and resource burden. Limitations on money
available for research, development and procurement of high
technology military equipment mean that choices must be made as to
which option to pursue. Yet these choices, by their very nature, have
to be made on limited knowledge and dubious extrapolation. If a
development is to be innovative and dependent on novel techniques,
its costs, effectiveness and timescale for production can only be
speculative. Yet the choices which are made on such a basis will have
profound long term effects on the force structures of the nation, its
economic strength, and ultimately on its security.</P>

<P>Some have described the end of the Cold War as a victory for
Western superior technology. Certainly the United States invested a
remarkable amount into its military research, and has produced some
spectacular new weapons as was seen in the Gulf War of 1991. Those
weapon systems were however developed as part of the military machine
to counter the Soviet Union, when widescale war between NATO and the
Warsaw Pact seemed an ever present possibility. The security concerns
for NATO nations are now much more diffuse and, to an extent, less
urgent and apocalyptic. There is no immediate threat to national
survival, but there are continuing threats to national interests. The
culture that has looked for technological solutions to security
problems has not disappeared. The drive for total security with no
risk to own forces premeates thinking in the United States. While
science offers new hopes for the defenders of democracy, it also
offers more dramatic weapons to the new small players on the
international scene. The operations that NATO nations are likely to
engage in are very different from the set piece high intensity
conflict planned for over four decades. The current inventories are
unlikely to be the optimum, and decisions are being made on new
directions for armed forces.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>What then in the optimum strategy for technology and military
systems? It is not possible to ignore what technology can offer, and
depend on resources devoted to more and more obsolete equipment. To
do so would be to court disaster. Military capability depends both on
quantity and quality of forces and weapons. While analysis of set
piece battles brought early operational researchers to the view that
quantity was of greater significance (that you needed four times the
combat capability to match a doubling of enemy size), present day
wargamers look for much better returns from technology. In theory, we
could have produced a large squadron of World War 2 bombers for the
price of a Tornado GR1 when it came into service. Yet not a single
Lancaster would have survived to reach the target in a modern air
defence environment. A stealth bomber can cost as much as a squadron
of Tornados. But if all the resources are placed in just one
aircraft, then however effective it may be, a single bullet may be
sufficient to destroy the force. This was the basis of the concern
over the road to absurdity, as each generation of new military
equipment is more capable, but less numerous. If the trend were not
broken, then a time would come when nations would be unable to afford
more than a single aircraft for their defence.</P>

<P>The question is not one of whether technology can offer
improvements in military capability - of that there is no doubt. The
key issue is, with limited resources, how can the technologies which
offer the greatest promise for military use be exploited, and hence
increase national security. This is a difficult problem, and any
analysis must depend on assumptions about the nature of the future
security concerns, the prospects of technological progress in
particular areas, the character of international relations, national
and global economic prospects, and a host of unquantifiable social
and political factors. Potential enemies must make similar decisions,
and the technologies they opt for, will influence the effort needed
on research for countermeasures. To make a rational allocation of
priorities for research effort requires an assessment of the relative
importance of differing military roles and equipment.</P>

<P>In the remainder of this volume, the research areas which offer
most potential for influencing security are examined. Science is not
partisan, and the products can be use for good or ill. The aim
therefore is to highlight those areas which may bear fruit for
whichever player decides to invest, and then to consider what
countermeasures are available to others. The greatest difficulty in a
time of such scientific plenty is to preserve a sense of perspective.
Today's miracle weapon is tomorrow's dead end. The next three
chapters attempt to give that sense of perspective by examining how
science has affected maritime, land and air warfare in the past. The
technological developments which have crucially affected the way war
has been conducted over the past two centuries are described, and
their common features sought. Space does not permit an examination of
the many scientific novelties which came to naught, although there
are many lessons for the military prophet in those disasters.</P>

<P>In the subsequent chapters the major areas of current scientific
research, both pure and applied, are described. Many already have
military applications, some have potential for weapons, others are
perhaps given too much weight in the allocation of priorities for
resources. Again some - the computer chip is one - have applications
in nearly every form of military effort. Yet even then the cost
benefits will vary with applications to different weapon types:
making a tank shell 'intelligent' will have a different investment
return from giving an offensive aircraft an all weather flying
performance. We consider only those applications which current theory
shows are possible, and have a reasonable chance of successful
development given sufficient resources, and perhaps as long as two
decades of development work.</P>

<P>In the concluding three chapters of the book, the application of
these technologies to future warfare is explored. While different
nations will have different needs, the aim is to produce a menu of
technical opportunities from which an appropriate selection could be
made. Hardware cannot be the whole story. How that military force
would be used is also crucial. The debate on tactical doctrine in the
light of new technologies is not yet finished. An often made
accusation about the military is that they have always planned to
fight the last war. The current discussions about tactical doctrine
for equipment, which is still in the laboratory, leads one to fear
that the pendulum may have swung too far the other way: we may be
planning to fight the next war but two, with the equipment of the
last one. It is vital that force structures and tactical doctrine are
reviewed in the light of new capabilities. Such changes should not be
implemented before the capability is deployed, and should also take
into account the political realities.</P>

<P>In some cases the tactics may be constrained by the political
limitations put on a new weapon system. However, if a new capability
and doctrine can produce more security at less cost, then the proper
assessment should influence the political constraints. There are
difficulties with such assessments. Traditional combat-proven
military techniques may be abandoned in a wave of enthusiasm for
novel fighting tactics, which work well in computer simulations, war
games, exercises and theoretical studies, yet have never undergone
the acid test of battle. Indeed, the problem of lack of combat
experience is all pervading for weapon designers and the military.
The Vulcan nuclear bomber aircraft was so successful in its deterrent
role, that it was some thirty years after its designers had worked at
its specifications, that it was first used in anger. The conventional
bombing in the Falklands Conflict of May 1982 was neither a role nor
location which could possibly have been foreseen by the architects of
Britain's strategic nuclear deterrent force in the 1940s. It is also
possible to focus on the glamorous new technology in a conflict, and
forget the key role that older equipment had to play. The remorseless
B52 missions in the Gulf War of 1992 were somewhat lower profile than
the F117 attacks on Baghdad. Even the advertising sticker which says
"Combat Proven" bears close analysis. How relevant was the war
environment to future possible conflicts?</P>

<P>A recurring lesson of successive conflicts has been that wars
never run according to plan for either side. Contingency plans, when
they exist, must be changed or scrapped; equipment must be
misemployed; and improvisation and initiative become more important
than firepower and technical superiority. This leads to yet another
caution in any approach to novel technologies. Do they improve the
versatility of the military machine? New weapon systems can be
designed to be more flexible in their applications, or they can
become more specialised. Worst of all, weapons can be designed around
a specific contingency or scenario, which today may appear likely,
but in the future, or in the event of war, may come to seem
tragically ridiculous.</P>

<P>The aim must be to invest in those areas of scientific research
which offer the promise of enhanced security at an affordable price,
and which leave sufficient flexibility to cope with the unforeseeable
defence problems of the future. There are areas of technological
advancement which carry the risk of decreasing security through a
reduction in strategic stability, flexibility, cost effectiveness,
political will, military forces, or public support. These are
fruitful areas for arms control negotiations, as it can be in no
state's interest to develop capabilities which reduce its security.
In the West, the cornucopia of novel technologies has meant that we
have increasingly sought a technical answer to every security
concern. If we devote increasing resources to the expanding range of
opportunities, we may find ourselves less and less able to afford the
defence structure that we need for our security. This is the
Technology Trap, and it has as its bait 'the neat solution'. Just
like the cheese in a mousetrap, the apparently free benefit may carry
a hidden and terminal cost.</P>
