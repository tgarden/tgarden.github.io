<P>I seem to spend last year going to a succession of conferences,
workshops and seminars addressing the problems of future European
Security. This could at one level seem rather curious. With the end
of the Cold War and the rapid move towards democratic government and
market economies throughout central and eastern Europe, one ought to
be able say that the prospects for a stable European continent have
never been better. Certainly there is for once no immediate threat of
war across the continent - and that is an unusual state. In the past,
Europe has been a source of both instability and conflict. The two
most destructive prolonged and geographically extended wars of this
Century began in the centre of Europe. The post-War peace in Europe
was bought only at the price of the continuous threat of a possible
third even more destructive war.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>By the end of the Cold War, part of Western Europe had made
considerable progress, along a route of economic interdependence,
towards making armed conflict unthinkable between fellow members of
the European Union. The Common Market was an excellent example of an
institution which has been a successful conflict prevention
mechanism. The development of common economic interests, with a
system of rules and laws common to member nations, has led to an
entity, within which war has been relegated to the near impossible.
This process continues as the EU develops, and as it looks at its
scope for a common European security identity. In parallel, the
success of NATO since its foundation has been not just in its role as
a collective security alliance, but also as a mechanism for building
confidence between members and preventing conflicts between members.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>So why is there so much angst, and I detect it among US
commentators as well as Europeans, about future European security?
Despite the end of the years of nuclear confrontation, and the
absence of any significant feeling of military threat in Western
Europe, it is clear that we are approaching a time when decisions are
going to be made that will profoundly affect the future of not just
European security, but have long-term worldwide repercussions. The
two parallel, but distinct, activities which are coming to a head are
the changes in prospect for NATO and for the European Union. 1997
will see a decision by NATO on how to enlarge, and also this year the
EU may decide on its approach both to security and to extended
membership.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In the United States, if I read your opinion polls correctly,
there seems to be reasonable public support for the enlargement of
NATO. However I was surprised by the degree of circumspection among
some of the US experts at Davos last week. IHowever your public
support may be for a wider range of states than NATO will wish to
take it at first. In Western Europe, there is as yet only limited
public interest in the question of NATO enlargement as the focus is
on EU issues. Here, the question which obsesses both opinion formers
and publics is that of monetary union rather than the Common Foreign
and Security Policy or the EU enlargement question. In particular in
Britain there is a vocal group who fear that monetary union will lead
inevitably to a federal Europe with a loss of sovereignty for the UK.
This lack of interest in the more urgent NATO and EU membership
agendas is strange as there is no doubt that the approach that is
taken over enlargement of both, and the European approach to its own
security will determine the future relations between states within
Europe and between Europe and the rest of the World.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In this brief talk, I shall reflect on some of the concerns that
we are hearing around Europe among those who do discuss such matters,
and I shall also raise the question of whether these concerns will
affect the ultimate outcome. I shall start with the question of NATO
enlargement because it looks as though it will be the first decision
to be taken, and perhaps also the first to be implemented. You are
all aware of the priority that has been attached by the US
Administration to making progress with the first tranche of
enlargement. NATO staffs are hard at work preparing for the Heads of
Government meeting in July in Madrid. We expect that the aim will be
to identify the first tranche of new states to be offered membership,
and perhaps a timescale working towards April 1999 when NATO will
celebrate its 50th birthday. All the smart money seems to be on that
offer being confined to Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic, with
Slovenia as a "perhaps". The assumption is that the mechanism for
further enlargement will also be revealed, and that the worries of
Russia will have been addressed. This is a pretty tall order, and
also hides some other problems, not least of which is where the
resources for enlargement are to come from. Even assuming that these
go relatively smoothly, there is still the requirement for each of
the current 16 nation's parliaments to ratify the amendment to the
treaty. Here there are other difficulties. You will know better than
me how it will play with the Senate. The perceived wisdom in Europe
is that it will be OK from a US perspective. The UK, despite a great
deal of adverse commentary from retired NATO diplomats, will
doubtless follow the US lead without much difficulty. It is not
impossible that there will be some difficulties from other European
members. In particular, Turkey sees the opportunity to bring its long
standing application for EU membership to the front of the queue. We
can therefore expect to see some haggling and indeed a muddling of EU
issues with the NATO enlargement process.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The biggest problem of course is the question of how to handle the
countries which are not in that first tranche, and especially Russia.
There is considerable concern that if this part of the process is
mishandled, we could see Europe divided again. There does not seem to
be a consistent view from those in Russia on what arrangement they
might be satisfied with. Nor is the hope in some European capitals
that, since NATO is self evidently not an aggressive organisation,
the Russians will understand that an enlarged NATO is a good thing.
The Ukraine is in an even more difficult position as it cannot decide
whether it wishes to point East or West or stay as an independent
bridge between both. When I was there in December, some of their
academics were suggesting that the sort of gesture they were looking
for was a Central European nuclear free zone. This would recognise
that the Ukraine had renounced its nuclear weapons, and would also
get over one of the Russian concerns of NATO placing nuclear forces
closer to them. In practical military terms, it would of course make
little difference. There are therefore ways to extend co-operation at
a time of enlargement. The latest signs seem to be that the Ukraine
will be able to cope with the first tranche of enlargement and will
be expecting benefits from closer cooperation to the West.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The central European nations that are not included in the first
invitation are likely to include the Baltic States, Romania and
Bulgaria, Slovakia, Albania and the successor states in the former
Yugoslavia. All these need to be brought closely into the European
fold. It may be that a clear commitment and criteria for future
tranches can be coupled with a deepening of PfP to keep them
interested. It will be a difficult diplomatic trick to turn.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>So the choice of approach, the achieving consensus of current
states (and that becomes a greater problem in an enlarged NATO), and
the handling of those left out, especially Russia and the Ukraine,
are some of the problems. There are others: resources for the
enlargement, resources to keep NATO as a real military force, the
role of NATO, internal disputes between members (particularly Greece
and Turkey and the question of Cyprus), the push by some for greater
European command authority and the management of relations with the
EU if a common foreign and security policy becomes more developed.
Time will not allow me to develop the role of the WEU in all this,
except to say that it seems sensible to continue to insist that the
WEU full members must be both members of the EU and of NATO. However,
if that does remain the practice, there will be some difficulties if
EU and NATO enlargement diverge in terms of countries.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Let me turn then to the other side of this security coin. As I
said the European Union in its various stages of development has
acted as a stabilising force. It has of course recently enlarged to
take in the 17 million people of East Germany with German
Unification. The economic burden of this relatively small expansion
has brought home, particularly to Germany, the costs of the process
and the need for clear criteria for new members. To many it has
looked as though the EU is moving deliberately slowly. The cynic
might say that NATO enlargement can be made as a political decision
and the problems solved afterwards, whereas EU enlargement is an
economic decision which will have a direct effect on the wealth of
the current members. The EU has moved with great care towards wider
association agreements with prospective new members. Negotiations
about the fine detail of each market sector have taken a long time
both to hammer out. The first of the non-members to apply back in
1987, Turkey, still is without any date for prospective membership -
hence its possible use of its NATO veto as a lever. It has taken from
1990 to 1995 for the EU to move to a position where it has started to
give a tentative timetable. The Council hoped that the preliminary
stage of negotiations with the Central and East European countries
would coincide with the start of negotiations with Malta and Cyprus
likely to be in early 1998.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The criteria for entry (the so-called Copenhagen criteria) require
a functioning market economy which can cope with the competitive
pressure inside the Union. Judging which states which meet this
criteria is likely to be next year. We might expect the first set to
include some of Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia, perhaps
Slovakia and Estonia, and possibly Malta and Cyprus depending on
Greek/Turkey relations and local politics. Having decided on its
tranche of new members, the EU will then get down to some hard
negotiations. It seems unlikely that any will become full members
before 2001/2002.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>What does all this mean for future European security. We have a
headlong rush towards a limited but important expansion of NATO by
1999, and uncertainties how to handle the remainder of Europe in a
NATO context beyond that. At the same time the EU is progressing more
slowly, and in a more detailed negotiating fashion towards an orderly
enlargement of its economic community. Membership of the EU may not
overtly confer a security guarantee on member nations, but it
certainly provides an implicit guarantee. It is inconceivable that EU
nations would stand aside if one of their number came under external
attack. Into this unclear future, we must also add the uncertain
developments down the road to common foreign and security policy for
Europe, and how it will relate to the WEU and NATO. In addition the
pressures for a move to a single currency may result in a two tier
community within the Union, and this would have very uncertain
results for the future of the EU. Behind both NATO and EU enlargement
there is also the question of costs. As nations run down their
national defence assets, they are showing little sign of being
prepared to pay for the NATO transition costs. Similarly, semi
stagnant European economies in recent years have delayed the
provision of the funds to accelerate the transformation of the
Central and Eastern European economies.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Finally what does this uncertain picture mean for the United
States and its relations with Europe? There is no doubt that
uppermost in the consideration of the current European members of
NATO is the importance of keeping the organisation relevant to
provide the key linkage with the US. This not to suggest that there
are not variations between States. The return of France to the fold
has been at the price of opening up debates about the need for more
European representation at the higher command levels. Nevertheless in
managing the transition, one of the aims will be to keep the US both
interested and involved in NATO. A mature European Union expanded to
25 or more countries perhaps towards the end of the next decade,
would have twice the population of the United States. On current
figures its combined GDP would already be a fifth greater than that
of the US, and of course for many of the states they would expect to
have a rapid growth ahead until they caught up with their western
European neighbours. This would make Europe relatively even richer.
It seems unlikely that under such circumstances, a stable and secure
Europe, rich and populous, that US would wish to keep its 100,000
troops based in Europe. However a draw down of these could lead to a
weakening of the NATO transatlantic bond, particularly if NATO felt
it had no real role. From a European perspective therefore the long
term security of the continent must centre on the development of a
European foreign and security policy with an ability to carry it out
on a European basis. We are a long way from that as yet.</P>
