			<address>Debate: The Lord Howe of Aberavon-To call attention to the resources available for the promotion of the worldwide interests of the United Kingdom; and to move for papers.</address>
			<p>My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Howe of Aberavon for the opportunity that this debate gives to acknowledge the contribution that so many different parts of the United Kingdom community&nbsp; makes to the promotion of our interests abroad.</p>
			<p>Your Lordships may not be surprised that I wish to concentrate my remarks on the work of the British military. I do this for two reasons. First to recognise the extraordinary contribution that they make around the world, but also to express my concerns about the extent to which they will be able to continue this work in future.</p>
			<p>During the Strategic Defence Review, the noble Lord, Lord Robertson of Port Ellen, made Defence Diplomacy one of the eight core tasks for the armed forces. I was included as an external expert specifically to look at this aspect of the Review and have subsequently done research work at King's College London for the Ministry of Defence looking at measuring effectiveness in this area. I was surprised, as were my academic colleagues, as we conducted field trips to look at training teams and loan service personnel at the sheer range of influence which the UK gains for remarkably small investment.</p>
			<p>Within the field of defence diplomacy, the training of international students within the UK also plays an important part. As I know from my time as Commandant of the Royal College of Defence Studies, this extends beyond senior military personnel to foreign government officials and policemen. The long term payoffs to British interests can be very high indeed.</p>
			<p>I particularly welcome the co-operation that has grown between the MOD, the FCO and DfID with the establishment of the Global conflict prevention pool and the similar Pool focused on sub-saharan Africa. This arrangement has encouraged the departments to work together to seek the best joint way of promoting stability in difficult areas of the world. Success in this can bring great dividends for British influence.</p>
			<p>The money allocated remains relatively small in defence terms, and the problems of the Middle East seem to be diverting a disproportionate part of the resources. But it is not just in the funding of conflict prevention resources that Iraq in particular is causing problems. Your lordships have talked often about the overstretch of British forces as they undertake the operational tasks in Iraq, increasingly in Afghanistan, continuing in the Balkans, and also have to cope with the downsizing of all 3 services.</p>
			<p>When priorities must be chosen, it will not be surprising if the immediate operational tasks get preference. Yet influence and trust can only be built up over a period of years. A training team in a difficult country will only gain access as it demonstrates continuing commitment.&nbsp; The operational overstretch makes it more difficult for the Services to provide people for training teams, loan service, advisory posts, and even to leaven the international participants in courses such as RCDS.</p>
			<p>Since the Strategic Defence Review, one other aspect of British international military effort has assumed even greater importance. Disaster relief has unhappily become a more frequent requirement. Rapid and generous help to devastated regions builds friends in the regions and increases the UK's standing both locally and internationally. Yet we still have recurring problems in the mechanics of deploying defence assets in sufficient quantity and with sufficient speed. Some of these problems appear to be bureaucratic; some are about availability of people, but increasingly there is also the question of whether the armed forces are equipped with the right equipment in the right numbers.&nbsp; Air Transport, both fixed wing and helicopter, is the key to rapid and effective relief operations.</p>
			<p>The defence budget has seen only a marginal real increase in funds in recent years, but the demands have become much greater. Operations have required both a broad range of capabilities, but also an ability to sustain forces for extended periods in increasingly difficult circumstances. Transport helicopters are already in short supply and have been in constant use for operations. When I asked the Minister, Lord Drayson, about plans for increasing transport helicopter numbers, his writeen answer made it clear that there will be no more over the next 5 years. Attack and reconnaissance helicopters for warfighting have priority over logistic support air transport in the coming years. Given the role that transport helicopters have in every aspect on modern military operations, this is a very surprising state of affairs. For once. we could have an equipment programme that not only helped our forces in difficult operational theatres, but also allowed us to promote British influence and standing in many regions.</p>
			<p>I would wish to pay tribute to the work done by 3 RAF Chinooks deployed to help with the Pakistan earthquake disaster. It is clear from reports back that they have achieved an enormous amount. It is not just the lifting capacity of the Chinook, it is the military organisation that supports it. Loads are used efficiently and sorties are not wasted, because resupply is what the crews and their army and RAF support teams train for. In 28 days, these 3 helicopters moved 1700 tons of food, shelter and medical suppies to inaccessible places.&nbsp; I see from the DfID website that they ceased operations as of 25 November 2005 after 28 days of operations. It would be helpful if the Minister could indicate why they have been withdrawn, as all the reports seem to suggest that there is still a desperate need for helicopter lift in the region.&nbsp; In the battle for hearts and minds in the Islamic world, these sorts of contributions are beyond price.</p>
			<p>My Lords, the British military are but one resource that the UK has available to promote its interests around the world. Media attention inevitably focuses on the high profile events, be they wars, relief operations or rescues. What is less well known is the years of military assistance which have been provided by outstanding individuals in difficult regions of the world. Democracy is more likely to grow from our efforts in sustained security sector reform than in quick offensive military operations.&nbsp; The FCO and DfID should take a keen interest in the MOD equipment programme, and make their future needs clear.&nbsp; The &pound;5.5 billion that the Iraq adventure has cost the UK so far could have bought much greater influence throughout the world than has been the case. Let us learn from our mistakes.</p>
