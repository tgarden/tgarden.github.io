			<h3>Defence Policy by Focus Group?</h3>
			<p>by Sir Timothy Garden</p>
		</div>
		<div align="left">
			<p>When George Robertson consulted widely during the formulation of the 1998 Strategic Defence Review (SDR), he received many plaudits. His discussions at specialist seminars and involvement of outside expertise was widely welcomed, and made any radical restructuring of the armed forces politically much easier. Since then the Ministry of Defence has taken open government more to heart. The discussion documents that have been produced have been helpful in showing how policy thinking is developing.<br>
				<br>
				Robertson's successor as Defence Secretary, Geoff Hoon, announced after  the terror attacks of 11 September 2001 that the Government would be adding a new chapter to the SDR to cover this new security problem. He was perhaps unwise to talk of a possible need for &quot;rebalancing&quot;, which was generally assumed to mean that there might be new counter-terrorist tasks for the MOD, but there would be no extra money from the Treasury. <br>
				<br>
				As the funding of the SDR was already becoming problematic, the idea that new tasks would have to be taken on without more funds was particularly unwelcome to the Services. The usual cost rises have taken their toll. Eurofighter was highlighted in the defence debate last week as having another price rise at the same time as further delays in entry into service. The lessons of Kosovo have also added new funding priorities. There is nothing spare to prime the pump for the EU defence project launched after the SDR by Tony Blair. The armed forces have just been awarded an inflation busting, but justified, pay rise of 3.7%. Not only will that use up more of the budget, but if it succeeds in helping to increase personnel numbers, the costs will rise yet further. The Treasury spin machine is working hard to undermine any bid for extra funds for Defence. All of this means that the extra chapter to the SDR is widely expected to be taken as an opportunity to bring the defence programme back into balance. This will mean cuts to some elements of the front line. Already the RAF has lost the Tornado F3 squadron, which has recently been allocated to the defence of airspace over the South East of the UK.<br>
				<br>
				Given the nature of the new terrorist threat, it was expected that even the MOD would move with some haste to produce any policy changes. It was certainly urged to conduct its review with some urgency by the Defence Select Committee. Geoff Hoon said that the results of the review would be available in the Spring of this year. Much was therefore expected of the preliminary discussion document (&quot;The SDR: A New Chapter&quot;), which was published on the day of the Defence debate. Instead it asks the public to answer a series of very broad foreign and security policy questions:<br>
				<br>
				&#149; What should the international community do to address the key underlying causes of international terrorism? What specifically should the UK aim to do?<br>
				&#149; In the medium to long term, what balance should the UK seek to strike between contributing Armed Forces, on the one hand, to help address the symptoms of terrorism and, on the other, to assist in efforts to address the causes of terrorism?<br>
				&#149; How should we strike a balance between the defence role in helping to protect the UK, and contributing to operations against international terrorists and other asymmetric threats overseas?<br>
				&#149; Are there ways in which military support to the civil authorities could be improved?<br>
				&#149; Are there additional or enhanced roles for our Reserve Forces (both in home defence and security and in overseas operations)?<br>
				&#149; Do we need to make adjustments to our forces, to give more weight to the threat of international terrorism and other asymmetric threats? Do the new challenges mean we should be placing less weight on other military tasks identified in the 1998 Strategic Defence Review?<br>
				&#149; Are the 5 conceptual aims (prevent, deter, coerce, disrupt and destroy) the right framework for the military role in countering terrorism abroad?<br>
				&#149; Within this framework, what is the right balance between operations to disrupt potential threats, find/strike operations and stabilisation operations? Should the UK continue to plan to participate in these types of operation?<br>
				&#149; Do we need to be able to deploy more of our forces more rapidly to counter terrorism worldwide? Should the UK aim to specialise in particular forms of capability or operation as a contribution to operations with allies or concentrate on particular geographic areas?<br>
				&#149; What are the roles of the UN, NATO and the EU in tackling international terrorism?<br>
				&#149; Do we need to devote a greater proportion of our military effort to prevention/co-operation activities or security sector reform overseas? How? Where?<br>
				<br>
				The public is invited to submit its views by 15 March. As the document says: &quot;This is your opportunity to give your views on what your Armed Forces should be doing and what they should be designed and equipped to do in light of the events of 11 September.&quot; <br>
				<br>
				While the realist will assume that this is another public relations exercise, it does nevertheless mark an unusual development in security policy making. In the past, prospective governments have outlined their broad approach to foreign and security policy in their election manifestos. The public has expected government to develop appropriate policy and capabilities to keep the nation safe. If security policy is to be determined by focus groups, special interest groups or the public at large, it seems unlikely that we will be able to sleep safer in our beds. <br>
