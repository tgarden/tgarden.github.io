			<DIV class="Sect">
				<p style="margin-bottom:0px; line-height:15px"><span style="font-family:'serif', 'Stone Serif', serif; font-size:9pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">While EU member states have not suffered a terrorist outrage as large as the attacks on the United States on 11 September 2001, they are all fully aware that they are also targets. The 191 deaths from Islamic extremist-linked attacks in Madrid on 11 March 2004 demonstrated that all European states are at risk. The attacks in November 2003 on UK commercial and diplomatic facilities in Turkey reminded Europe that these threats are international in nature. For over 50 years, most western European states have depended on collective security through NATO. Facing a potential armed threat from the Soviet Union, they shared their defence requirements, and drew heavily on US resources. In the new world of international terrorism, NATO is less well-suited to providing defence from the threat. </span></p>
				<p style="margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:12px; line-height:15px"><span style="font-family:'serif', 'Stone Serif', serif; font-size:9pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">Yet there is a natural desire to try to adapt the Alliance to provide the capabilities to take on the new challenges. At the same time Europe has continued to move towards economic and political integration. The final piece in this move is the vision of a common foreign and security policy for Europe. There is much to be done, but the new terrorist threat, and a divergence from strategic thinking in the United States, may give added impetus to European Defence Policy. </span></p>
				<p style="margin-bottom:18px; text-indent:12px; line-height:15px"><span style="font-family:'serif', 'Stone Serif', serif; font-size:9pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">The member states agreed</span><span style="font-family:'serif', 'Stone Serif', serif; font-size:5.7pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000"><sup>1 </sup></span><span style="font-family:'serif', 'Stone Serif', serif; font-size:9pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">in 2003 on the nature of the new security challenges. They would need to give priority to addressing the threats from international terrorism, proliferation, failing states and from international crime. This would mean that all the diplomatic, economic and military levers of power would need to be provided. In parallel, the European members of NATO had agreed at Prague in December 2002 that a range of new capabilities, including those of a modern deployable military force, were needed to meet the new threats. It is not yet clear whether the political will exists throughout the EU to fulfil these potentially expensive promises. Much may depend on how the transatlantic relationship develops, and whether NATO can rise to the current difficulties. </span></p>
				<p style="margin-bottom:18px; text-indent:12px; line-height:15px"><span style="font-family:'serif', 'Stone Serif', serif; font-size:9pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000"><b>The Nature of US Power</b></span></p>
				<p style="margin-bottom:0px; line-height:15px"><span style="font-family:'serif', 'Stone Serif', serif; font-size:9pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">US foreign policy is about promoting the interests of the United States; but this is true for most states. Yet those US interests are served by having growing economies in peaceful societies with which to trade. Nevertheless, there is mounting concern that this rich, commercial, high technology, well-armed superpower is minded to take ever less notice of the views of other states or the constraints of the international system. The litany of issues that are dividing Bush’s America from the rest of the world is growing longer. They include tariffs on steel, subsidies to farms, lack of interest in arms control and environmental controls, coupled with antipathy to the International Criminal Court. The lack of objectivity over Israel is another source of concern to Europeans, as is the apparent unwillingness of the Bush Administration to use the international system. </span></p>
				<p style="margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:12px; line-height:15px"><span style="font-family:'serif', 'Stone Serif', serif; font-size:9pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">US power is based on a number of inter-related elements. The internal factors include the strong economy, a lack of focused internal dissent and perhaps a unique culture of national certainty and pride. The external factors include a long history of lack of threats from near neighbours, the lack of any other global power of equal capability, and a military machine that surpasses all other nations. The scale of defence spending and investment in new military technology is truly astonishing under the circumstances of overwhelming superiority. That is not to say that the US military is exempt from the difficulties of fast rising defence costs that other states suffer from. It has personnel retention, infrastructure and equipment replacement problems, and these can be exacerbated by the focus on high technology future systems at the expense of maintaining current operational capabilities. But that said, for all the inefficiencies of military programmes, the United States stands in a different league of military capability from any other state. The increase in US defence spending</span><span style="font-family:'serif', 'Stone Serif', serif; font-size:5.7pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000"><sup>2</sup></span><span style="font-family:'serif', 'Stone Serif', serif; font-size:9pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000"> over the coming years will drive the military technology development at an even faster pace.

				<p style="margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:12px; line-height:15px"><span style="font-family:'serif', 'Stone Serif', serif; font-size:9pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">Before 11 September 2001, the United States believed that its only large-scale vulnerability on its own territory came from the strategic nuclear capabilities of Russia and China, and potentially in the future from proliferating states of concern. These could be addressed by closer cooperation and arms control in the case of Russia, and by the use of technology to provide defensive systems in the case of the proliferating states and China. </span></p>
				<p style="margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:12px; line-height:15px"><span style="font-family:'serif', 'Stone Serif', serif; font-size:9pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">Since the end of the cold war, the United States has flexed its military muscle in a number of areas. Over the last decade of the twentieth century, it was able to develop a new perspective on the application of military power: one that was driven by technology. The Gulf War saw the United States in the lead of a large coalition, operating with the full backing of the United Nations, to free Kuwait after invasion by Iraq. The shadows of the Vietnam War were finally laid to rest as the United States demonstrated that its </span><span style="font-family:'serif', 'Stone Serif', serif; font-size:9pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">investment in aerospace technology could produce a new way of fighting wars. The remorseless prolonged air campaign meant that the ground operation could be completed with virtually no casualties to the Allied forces. The theories of generations of air power enthusiasts seemed at last to have been proved. </span></p>
				<p style="margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:12px; line-height:15px"><span style="font-family:'serif', 'Stone Serif', serif; font-size:9pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">Yet at the time there was no certainty of such a cost free operation. Subsequent experience in Somalia showed that it was still possible for US military might to be thwarted by an unsophisticated enemy. The casualty-free experience of the Gulf War had set new political standards for the way US military operations were to be conducted in operations that were not about defence of the homeland. Precision air power was seen by some to have been the key enabler for the Dayton agreement in Bosnia. In Kosovo, the doctrine had advanced to a stage where the use of ground force in hostile territory was discounted by President Clinton from the start of operations. </span></p>
				<p style="margin-bottom:18px; text-indent:12px; line-height:15px"><span style="font-family:'serif', 'Stone Serif', serif; font-size:9pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">Each campaign reinforced the message that air power, space systems and precision attack could allow the United States to intervene, change governments, right wrongs and celebrate the American way without risking GI lives. At the same time this focus on technology has widened the military capability gap between the United States and the rest of the world, which has had a profound effect on the practicality of Alliance operations. The French Air Force found itself isolated in the Gulf War because of it being years away from NATO interoperability standards. A decade later, few Allies were invited to join the offensive operations in the air over Afghanistan, because even the most ardent NATO allies were failing to keep abreast of the technical standards needed to operate with the new US systems. Allies are more about political and overflight or basing support these days than about making a real military contribution to any operation which the United States leads. And if the United States is not in the lead, it loses interest rapidly. While post-conflict operations have been the big activity for European states and others over the last decade, US forces have been reluctant participants, and some would say not too effective either. The nature and tactics of warfare have changed for the United States; but its allies have been slow to accommodate to these changes. </span></p>

>The European Union has also changed in the decade since the end of the cold war. Europe was the region directly affected by the fall of the Berlin Wall, the end of the Soviet Union and of the Warsaw Pact. It had lived with a very real and urgent threat of the ultimately destructive war being fought across its territory, and that threat disappeared faster than could ever have been imagined. The process of integration continued, especially with the work towards monetary union. The 15 EU states – expanded to 25 in May 2004 – found themselves at peace with each other, growing more prosperous. The </SPAN

>EU members have learned a number of lessons during the decade of the 1990s. Europe suddenly felt safer than it had in living memory. Defence budgets fell as the worries of the cold war were forgotten. Most operational combat forces fell by between 30 and 40 per cent. Some countries, such as the United Kingdom, took the opportunity to reshape their armed forces towards their interpretation of future needs. Others, like Germany, were slower to restructure. Germany had discovered the time and cost that it took to carry out the reunification process. To an extent it still bears the financial burden of its generous arrangement. This has given it a defence squeeze from two different directions: lack of money and inappropriate military structures. </SPAN

>Yet Europe was also discovering that it could operate in some aspects as a regional power. Trade negotiations were much more effective when conducted at the EU level than by individual states. The EU could restrain unfair practices from any part of the world, and most particularly could face down the United States in trade disputes when necessary. But the EU was still missing the essential qualification to be regarded as a serious global power comparable to the United States. Foreign and security policy remained largely national activities, and if Europe was threatened directly, then NATO was still the forum to turn to. </SPAN

>Coping with the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia was also not a success story for the EU as a coherent security organisation. Here was a part of Europe that was to cause difficulties for all EU member states as it broke up. Yet the United States was needed to drive through an enforceable settlement in Bosnia. The United States provided the major warfare contribution to NATO’s operation in Kosovo, and NATO remained in the lead, at least initially, as Macedonia subsequently faced instability. </SPAN

>The European Union found itself with important regional interests in its backyard, but without the diplomatic and military cohesion and strength to solve the thorny problems of the region. A year after the election of a Labour government in the United Kingdom in 1997, important policy developments in Britain were initiated, which were able to advance progress on developing EU diplomatic and military power. Previously, the United Kingdom had been unhelpful to any moves towards greater cooperation on security policy by EU states. It was feared that this would undermine NATO, and perhaps lead to a disengagement by the United States in the longer term. </SPAN

>The Anglo-French summit at St Malo in late 1998 changed this obstructive agenda. The process over the following months led to a more enthusiastic and practical approach to European Defence Policy. The EU states agreed at Helsinki to work towards specific goals to bring together military capabilities </SPAN

>for specific operations, other than the NATO task of territorial defence. These ‘Petersberg Tasks’ might involve humanitarian relief, peacekeeping, peace enforcement or conflict prevention. The capability for Europe was sized to be up to 60,000 troops available to be deployed in under two months and sustainable for 12 months, with all the necessary air and sea power support. </SPAN

>The work on developing this modest military capability for the European Union is very important. At the 2000 Commitments Conference, EU members indicated what forces they were prepared to make available at the required notice for European Union authorised operations. The absolute numbers offered were impressive – 100,000 troops, 400 combat aircraft and 100 ships – but the packages were complex. </SPAN

>From the United Kingdom, the army would provide either an Armoured or Mechanised brigade, each of which could be sustained for at least a year; or an Air Assault brigade, which could be deployed for up to six months. Combat Support enabling capabilities such as Artillery, and Short Range Air Defence, and Attack Helicopters could be deployed in addition. The Navy has committed an aircraft carrier, two nuclear powered submarines, four destroyers/frigates, support vessels; and an amphibious task group, including one helicopter landing platform and an amphibious brigade. The aircraft carrier, helicopter landing platform and submarines could not necessarily be sustained continuously for a whole year. In the air, the United Kingdom has offered up to 72 combat aircraft (including Sea Harriers, which are now to be phased out under national plans), with associated support aircraft including strategic transport. This number would be available for six months to cover initial theatre entry. For a longer-term commitment the total would reduce. As can be seen, the offer has constraints on time that may not fully meet the Helsinki requirement, and other states will need to be able to fill the gaps. As time passes, some of the promises cannot be fulfilled because of reductions in national force structures. </SPAN

> The list of these deficiencies is long. They include such elements as the necessary air and sea transport to deploy European forces with their equipment. There is insufficient air-to-air refuelling support for all the military aircraft that might be deployed on operations. While the cold war has left us with many air defence fighters, procured against the threat of Soviet bombers, Europe lacks the precision all-weather offensive capabilities that we have become used to in US operations. </SPAN

>At the Prague Summit of November 2002, NATO streamlined the list of 59 weaknesses to a handful, in the hope that members would at least address the most important. A similar exercise in the Helsinki Headline Goals process has tried to put pressure on EU members to fill these gaps. The approaches are still fragmented. The lack of strategic air transport has been turned into a question of European joint procurement rather than one of European joint capability. The funding for the A400M strategic air transport project becomes the test of how strong a state supports European defence. Yet the capability is needed now, not at some indeterminate time in the future. It is a low technology requirement which could be filled by a range of solutions available on the market today. Nevertheless, the question that remained was how appropriate the new NATO transformation was for countering the growing threat from terrorism? </SPAN

The good work in Justice and Home Affairs that followed 11 September has shown that sovereignty issues can be overcome when there is a pressing need. The question still to be answered is how do we make some move on the capabilities issue? National defence budgets are overstretched everywhere in Europe, and problems have sharpened since 11 September as new urgent priorities for security spending have been added. Even in the United Kingdom, the signs of British military decline continue as capability after capability is phased out early.

>Europe has 25 armies, 23 air forces and 20 navies, all with their own command structures, headquarters, logistics organisations, and training infrastructure. Some have similar equipment, others incompatible units. All have been in decline as the effect of fast rising personnel and equipment costs take their toll. Even though the total of EU defence budgets has totalled less than half of that of the United States, EU member states continue to field 1.6 million people in uniform compared with 1.4 million US regular forces. EU states also maintain 2.6 million reservists, which is more than twice the number the United States feels that it needs. The European Union has far too many surplus military people, who as a result are even more ill-equipped than necessary. </SPAN

>If this was a multinational business, the answer would be self-evident. Streamline the company so that the overheads for small non-viable branches could be covered by common services. Unless the Europeans start rationalising their military capabilities now, they will individually and progressively cease to have any useful global, and eventually even national, role. In Britain, we have become used to the remorseless rationalisation process in defence as our costs rise faster than normal domestic inflation. After the 1998 Strategic Defence Review, the United Kingdom may have now approached the limits of rationalisation at the national level. France has recognised this difficulty with a serious increase in defence spending. Germany has more national options, as it still has an internal rationalisation process to go through; but this will be politically very difficult. </SPAN

>All proposals for more capable European forces will require serious investment. While European states are to a greater or lesser extent restructuring their forces, there is little sign that new money will be made available for new capabilities. Defence budgets at best are held level in real terms, and this is insufficient to fund either major new capabilities, or to maintain force levels over a period of time. Yet plans for specialist contributions, such as the NATO Response Force</SPAN

> proposal of 2002, will need early funding if they are to be achieved. In addition, there is a range of modern enabling capabilities that are needed throughout Europe and will remain unaffordable by individual states. These states are all also having to look at the need to provide national defences to counter the effects of possible terror attacks. </SPAN

>There are three complementary pressures on European states to start taking forward pooling of some force elements. First, pooling offers the opportunity for lower overhead costs, and the resources released might then be used to fund new enabling capabilities including the proposed strike force. Second, pooling would make the new enabling capabilities more affordable on a </SPAN
><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'Stone Serif', serif; font-size:9pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000"
>shared basis. Thirdly, pooled forces would drive moves towards greater interoperability and common doctrine and equipment. If suitable transformational capabilities were operated on a pooled basis, they could act as the motivating drive for states to start transforming their national capabilities in order to exploit the shared enabling capability. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'Stone Serif', serif; font-size:9pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000"
>There is one other consideration that could increase the attractiveness of pooled capabilities to European governments. The experience of the Afghanistan campaign has increased doubts about the relevance of NATO to future high intensity campaigns. The only NATO contribution was its one joint-owned, joint-operated (pooled) force: AWACs. All other contributions to the US operation in Afghanistan were arranged on a bilateral national basis. If NATO is to be seen as relevant as an organisation for future operations, it would benefit not only from fielding European capabilities that were able to operate alongside US forces, but also by fielding them as NATO or EU joint-owned, joint-operated capabilities. This would mean that Europe would be in the loop on any decision to use such force elements. If Europe had a serious military capability available, and had a common policy, it might have found that it would have had a greater say in the handling of the Iraq diplomatic crisis of 2003. </SPAN

>The smaller states are moving down the path of integration already as they lose capabilities. The joint naval arrangement between the Dutch and the Belgians is a good illustration of what is possible. Of course shared capabilities are not new. There are many things which we have today that could be pooled. Air transport is a good example, and Germany has set up an organisation that could manage such an arrangement. Again, to produce capability and cost benefits, it needs to be done with what is in place now, not on the back of some uncompetitive, long-term European procurement plan. Much of the equipment that could be pooled is American, because that is where common capabilities exist. Tactical transport using C130s</SPAN

>One of the great missed opportunities, both from the military and commercial aspect, has been the failure of states to pool the Eurofighter force. With a pooled force, the support costs would have been much less, and the aircraft configuration control could be maintained, unlike the Tornado. It would also allow smaller European nations to buy a handful of Eurofighters to add to a much larger force. The cost benefits between such a Eurofighter buy, JSF or upgrades to F16 or F18s might work out very differently then. Failing to pool the Eurofighter means it will cost far more to operate and do far less than it could have done with a little more imagination. It will also sell to fewer European countries. </SPAN

>These examples suggest some practical areas where the development of European Force Elements and common support and logistic services could provide building blocks for the strengthening of European defence contributions. They would make more effective use of European national defence budgets through the removal of the cost overhang of separate support systems. Valuable as such individual initiatives would be, they would not by themselves represent a coherent new security contribution by Europe. They would, however, illustrate how significant improvements in effectiveness could be achieved through merging national capabilities and sharing common services. </SPAN

>For this approach to become coherent, it would be necessary to develop a planning and budgetary system at the European level. Eventually there would be a requirement for a European Defence Budget. If such an accounting system were managed by the European Union, members would provide either defence capability or money as their contribution. This would have a number of beneficial effects: not only would the free ride be stopped, but states would probably prefer to improve their military capabilities rather than contribute money to the employment and industries of other states. Peer pressure, as well as legally binding commitments to a given level of defence expenditure, might come to seem markedly more compelling to the participants than the distinctly low-key incentives that have characterised NATO cooperation. A virtuous circle of improved military capability and effective European defence could be established. There would be many problems in assessing the true worth of each contribution, but the process would also make the planning and audit at the European level more effective. </SPAN

>There is a real threat to the territory of each European state from international terrorism. Logic would suggest that NATO would be the organisation of choice for providing collective security against this threat. This certainly appeared to be the thinking of the Greek government when it requested NATO assistance for the 2004 Olympic Games. Terrorists seek easy targets, which will attract wide publicity. They may want to attack the interests of certain countries. </SPAN

><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'Stone Serif', serif; font-size:9pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000"
>produce a collective response. But the help which NATO could provide was very limited. The Greek authorities needed to be very clear in what they expected from a NATO component.

>Proposals for using NATO in the air to monitor air threats with AWACS were more appropriate. Similarly defending the coast from the sea was a capability that NATO could deploy. Following the attacks of 9/11, NATO had set up some capabilities which proved useful. Operation Active Endeavour (OAE) was launched on 18 October 2001. It provided maritime surveillance and monitoring in the Mediterranean. More than 41,000 ships have been tracked during the operation. An expansion in OAE was announced in March 2004, and allowed NATO to help protect the Olympics from terrorist attack from the sea. </SPAN

>The area in which NATO capabilities could prove most useful are in coping with the aftermath of a terrorist attack. NATO could provide a quick reaction force to deal with the consequences of a major attack. Helicopters, medical troops, decontamination specialists, and engineers may all be needed if things go wrong. Putting together such a capability would be useful for the whole of Europe. The Madrid bombing of March 2004 showed that the attacks may occur anywhere. While national police forces are better placed to be in the lead for prevention, consequence management may need the resources of many countries. NATO could plan and assemble such a capability. As we think of the possible use of chemical, biological or nuclear material in future terror attacks, the military expertise will become more necessary. The muchpublicised NATO Response Force, agreed at the Prague summit in 2002, might be better equipped with paramedics rather than precision weapons. Development of such capabilities are likely to be slowed by continuing transatlantic differences over the best counter-terrorism strategy and the war in Iraq. </SPAN

>The military security dimension is important for Europe in its future relations with the United States. To be cast in the role of sweeper-up after America is not an enticing prospect. Without addressing the shortfalls in military capability, EU member states will find themselves less and less able to operate individually, or collectively with the United States to support their common interests. Nor will they have a strong voice in where and how future operations are conducted. Yet Europe will be expected to take on the post-conflict tasks as a share of the transatlantic burden. Kosovo was NATO’s first and last war, and future arrangements will be much more about Europeans and Americans operating together or separately. NATO will survive as a place for dialogue, and perhaps as a useful organisation to set common military standards, but even then interoperability will decline if the technology gap becomes too great. The lack of significant outcome from the NATO Summit in Istanbul in June 2004 gives little reason for optimism. </SPAN

>The national politics of much greater European defence integration are difficult. But there are opportunities that would produce more capability for lower cost, with no effect on sovereignty. Those benefits must be used to grow the missing European enabling capabilities, and that will need the European Union to control funds. At the same time the European Union needs to address the need for a clear cooperative approach to countering terrorism.  </SPAN
><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'Stone Serif', serif; font-size:9pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000"
>Even if Europe were to follow a path towards providing greater effectiveness in its defence spending, it would still need to look at the priorities for tackling the threat from international terrorism and proliferation. While there are times when the use of offensive military force may be appropriate, Iraq in 2003 showed that many EU states are reluctant to use force before the alternatives have been exhausted. The European Union is much better placed than any individual state to use all the possible economic, diplomatic, police, and wider political levers to reduce terrorism in the longer term and defend against it in the shorter term. Military power remains important both for influence and ultimately for use when necessary. In this one area, the European Union is giving poor value for money, and the international systems suffer as a result. </SPAN
