<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Judging Priorities for Investment</FONT>
</H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Scientific advances have provided
extraordinary new capabilities for mankind to use for good or ill.
Yet even the most magical of new technologies is constrained by the
nature of matter, the laws of physics and the universal constants.
Weapon systems have been a focus for much research and development
effort. Each new offensive capability has spawned a search for an
effective defensive countermeasure. The early advocates of air power
believed that "the bomber will always get through". Radar, fighters,
guns and missiles were developed to prove the early theorists wrong.
Against such defences, the bombers' success rate had to be improved
by flying lower, or using electronic counter-measures, or by giving
them a  smaller radar cross-section. At any given time in the past 60
years, there has been a technological battle between offence and
defence in air combat capabilities. The trend has been increasingly
in favour of offensive capability with the move towards greater use
of ballistic and cruise missiles. The effectiveness of offensive
weapons have also increased with improvements in precision of
attacks. Finally, the advent of weapons of mass destruction (WMD)
have made the requirement for absolute assurance in any defensive
system much more demanding.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Systems that attempt to defend against
incoming offensive missiles have therefore to be seen, from a
military perspective, as but one aspect of a complex interplay of
offensive and defensive capabilities. Airmen argue over whether air
supremacy is achieved more efficiently by an offensive counter-air
campaign (targeting airfields, command centres, missile sites and
aircraft in their bunkers), or by air-to-air fighters patrolling the
skies. Both are needed, but long term investment decisions need to
make judgements about the relative priority of each campaign.
Resources are finite for every country, and in most countries those
funds available for the military are declining. Any military benefit
analysis of missile defence must weigh its relative contribution 
against other capabilities foregone to free up sufficient funds.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	No defensive system can give 100%
assurance of preventing a successful offensive attack. There are many
factors which affect the overall success rate of defences. The
theoretical technical capability of a given defensive system will be
modified in any given scenario by the numbers of attacking systems,
the number of defending systems, the redundancy of the defences, the
reliability of  hardware and software, the warning and reaction
times, the deviation of the attack parameters from the optimum
assumptions, and also by less predictable human factors. Higher
assurance is bought at extra cost through such approaches as layered
defences, duplicated systems and automated response. A judgement has
to be made about the acceptable rate of defensive leakage for any
given scenario. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	In looking for a military judgement on
investment in missile defensive systems, we must  examine the range
of possible scenarios. These can be  broken down into four broad
requirements starting with the most difficult: </FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Defending against a major WMD attack</FONT>
</H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The threat of a major WMD attack is the
most serious challenge that any government faces. Throughout the Cold
War, it was the focus of all strategic thinking. The prevention of
such an attack was achieved through nuclear deterrence, which
required NATO and the Warsaw Pact to field credible second strike
forces which could survive a nuclear attack. In the 1960's, the US
and the Soviet Union each did a considerable amount of work on
developing anti-ballistic missile  (ABM) defensive systems to reduce
the threat to their territories posed by each other's nuclear tipped
missiles. It rapidly became clear to both that the cost of improving
the offensive systems to counter ABM defences was considerably less
than the cost of the ABM system. In March 1969, President Nixon
announced that defence against a heavy Soviet attack was not
feasible.  The realisation by both sides that Ballistic  Missile
Defence (BMD) was impractical, unaffordable and would lead to
increased offensive deployments by the opposition led to the ABM
treaty in 1972. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Not surprisingly, there remained a strong
body of opinion that technology must be able to provide some form of
defence against the nuclear threat. This was voiced by President
Reagan in his speech to the nation of 23 March 1983  when he said:
"What if .... we could intercept and destroy ballistic missiles
before they reached our own soil or that of our allies?". The
Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) was launched with the aim of
finding an answer to the President's vision. The proponents of SDI
argued  that space, computer and weapons technology had advanced
considerable since the earlier attempts to develop BMD. Yet
technology had also moved on in offensive nuclear capability. Small
multiple warheads coupled with decoys allowed many more threats to be
posed to any defensive system by each hostile missile. While the
proposed layered system might give a much greater assurance of
successful interception, an optimistic projected defensive leakage
rate of just 1% still represented 100 nuclear warheads arriving from
the 10,000 that the Soviets had available at the time. A vastly
expensive, technically unproven, potentially destabilising SDI
deployment would not provide useful protection to US major centres of
population. Again, much research money was spent and much strategic
debate was had before the SDI quietly disappeared with the end of the
Cold War.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	While the threat of a large scale nuclear
attack on any nation is now much reduced, there are still a large
number of nuclear weapons and long-range delivery systems available
to the USA, Russia, China, France and the UK. Nevertheless, the
technological infeasibilty of 100% effective missile defences 
remains a strong argument against investing funds to try to defend
populations from a mass WMD attack, particularly as the threat of
such an attack is very low. This view appears to have been accepted
in the United States and elsewhere. However, the technology advances
explored during the SDI programme have left an enthusiasm for
deploying a defensive system against a more limited WMD
threat.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Defending against a Limited WMD
Attack</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	When it became clear in the 1960's that
the US would not be able to deploy a useful ABM system to defend its
population against a nuclear exchange with the Soviet Union, the
deployment of a light system was justified on the ground of
protection against a limited attack. That attack was either from a
power with few weapons (China at the time) or an accidental Soviet
launch. In the event, the US dismantled its only deployment and the
Soviet Union maintained only its single treaty permitted site around
Moscow. The defensive technologies researched during the SDI period
of the 1980's are now in a similar fashion seen as providing the
technical feasibility for a defence against a limited WMD attack on a
nationwide basis: National Missile Defence (NMD). In this case, the
argument is made that a greater than 99% assurance of interception
will provide adequate capability against a threat from a "rogue
state" proliferator, who might acquire a small number of long range
missiles with which to threaten the United States. Although technical
development of such systems is still proving elusive and expensive,
it is not unreasonable to assume that, given sufficient time and
money, a multilayered NMD system with such limited aims may be
possible in the relatively near term. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The scenario requires future circumstances
in which the United States perceives itself to be under threat of
nuclear, biological or chemical ballistic missile attack from one of
a handful of states, which might include Iran, Iraq and North Korea. 
To counter such a threat would require the deployment of a wide area
layered defensive system, which in turn requires a radical
renegotiation of the ABM Treaty. Assuming that such a system were
deployed, what would be the effect on the strategy of potential
enemies? There would be an incentive to increase missile numbers and
warheads to achieve a greater likelihood of penetration. Perhaps more
productively, alternative delivery means would be fielded. Options
include commercial aircraft, cruise missiles, small  drones,
container ships or human agents. All of these alternative systems
could be effective biological weapon carriers, and some would allow
nuclear weapon delivery. Thus an NMD deployment would only provide
partial protection against a limited threat from a small number of
states. It would not give sufficient confidence in the United States'
invulnerability to allow it to ignore the threat from potential
proliferators, nor would it protect against the non-state actors with
non-ballistic missile WMD capability. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Deployment of NMD would also affect
relations with other nuclear powers, and with Allies. Other nuclear
powers would have a disincentive to reduce their own holdings of
weapons in a world where excess numbers may begin to have
significance again. This in turn increases the risk of accidents and
reduces overall security. The US has strategic alliances in Europe,
Japan and  Korea. The way in which these arrangements of shared risk
would be affected by the deployment of a US NMD system is not clear,
but there are already signs of discomfort in terms of alliance
relationships, which bode ill for global security.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	An NMD system would be very costly to
develop, to deploy and to maintain. Given the military capability
needs shown in such operations as Kosovo, it is unlikely that
diverting scarce resources into NMD would be a sensible military
priority.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Defence of operational military formations
against missile attack</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Operational military formations will
regularly find themselves threatened by attack from enemy systems.
Increasingly, such threats may be from surface to surface missiles as
well as artillery and enemy aircraft. While nuclear attack remains
improbable (and is deterred by the possibility of nuclear
retaliation), there is a real threat of chemical agents being used by
some potential enemies. The Gulf War of 1991 was a good example of a
campaign where allied troops had to be prepared to be attacked by
Iraqi Scud missiles with the possibility of chemical warheads. Such a
threat means that troops will be forced to operate in NBC protective
clothing and take other protective measures. This reduces operational
capability significantly, even if chemical attacks do not take place.
Nevertheless, such a threat is only one of a number of concerns that
a deployed force will have. The main weight of fire is likely to be
carried out by aircraft dropping conventional bombs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	In the Gulf War, the deployment of Patriot
missiles to provide some limited anti-Scud intercept capability was
seen as politically important. From a military effectiveness aspect,
their role was more  a boost to troop and civilian  (particularly in
Israel) morale than a change to the balance of forces. Troops still
needed to take NBC precautions and to defend against the whole
spectrum of potential threats. A more effective counter to the Scud
threat was to carry out offensive missions to destroy the launchers
and the missiles. Undoubtedly, it will be possible to continue to
improve the anti-missile effectiveness of Patriot like defensive
systems. This will be a sensible strategy for improving air defences
for operations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Proposals for a more comprehensive
deployable theatre wide defensive system begin to run into cost
effectiveness problems. To provide a layered defensive system over
the theatre of operations would require many of the elements of the
NMD system. However, the system would have the added complication of
having to be deployable worldwide. It could be more austere (fewer
layers) because a higher leakage rate would be acceptable. In the end
there will have to be an analysis of the trade-off between cost and
complexity. It is unlikely that even the most costly solution would
provide sufficient defensive assurance to allow NBC passive defence
measures to be abandoned. Given this, it would seem unlikely that
comprehensive layered theatre missile defence systems will be a
sensible investment from a military point of view.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Point defence of key locations against
missile attack</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The easiest requirement for defence
against missile attack is that of protecting a discretely located
small area. The best example is that of a naval ship. The target is
well defined and all defences can be optimised to counter only those
incoming missiles which will hit the ship. Already there are ship
borne missile defences which achieve high degrees of protection.
Similarly, aircraft routinely defend themselves against missile
attack. There is a need to provide this type of protection for key
communication nodes, headquarters and other installations. The
smaller the location, the easier it is to provide late interception
or deflect the incoming missile from its target. The development of
low cost point defence systems would allow them to be more widely
deployed than the limited numbers of such systems available
currently, and would begin to give some wider area protection.
Concentration on this aspect of missile defences would cause no
treaty problems, would improve military capability in all aspects and
is technically low risk.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Conclusion</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	From a military planner's point of view,
there would seem to be benefit in directing research and development
effort into the incremental improvement of ground-based point defence
anti-missile systems. Multi-layered wide area missile defences will
distort defence spending and are unlikely to provide significant
improvements in useful military capability.</FONT></P>
