			<h3>MOD reviews its  performance</h3>
			<h3>by Sir Timothy Garden</h3>

			<p>Since Defence White Papers have become little more than glossy PR brochures, interested observers of developments in defence policy have had to delve among a number of different official sources.  One of the more useful documents is the MOD Annual Performance Report.  The latest one (Cmn 5000) for the 1999/2000 reporting year was slipped to Parliament  on the 19 December. With MPs set for Christmas in their constituencies there was little chance that it would excite much interest. In style it is reminiscent of the old Soviet Union&#146;s claims of always exceeding the latest 5 year plan expectations. The reader is left amazed that target after target is either met or on course. These claims seem to be  at variance with NAO reports of procurement and training problems, Select committee reports of manpower shortages, and newspaper stories of widespread equipment deficiencies.</p>
			<p>For the informed observer, the Performance Report addresses some areas of difficulty, but in a less than comprehensive way.  A prime example is in the area of personnel. The RAF is described as being on course for 100% manning. Yet evidence to the Defence Select Committee in early 2000 made it clear that the RAF was short of 20% of its required fast jet pilots, and that this position would inevitably worsen over the next 3 years. The detail of the text within the report mentions that there are shortages in some specialist areas. However, it is difficult to see how any air force which has a worsening shortage of combat pilots, can be said to be on course for satisfactory manning. The army is said to be slipping in its plan to achieve even 95% of its trained manpower requirement. Yet nowhere in the introduction by the Defence Secretary are any problems brought to the notice of the reader. Geoff Hoon gives a catalogue of success, good actions by the Government and a declaration that the military have quality equipment. Much of this, were it ever to be read by the troops, would bring some hollow laughs. </p>
			<p>Many will argue that it is unreasonable to expect anything other than a degree of self congratulation in such publications. Defence White papers were rarely self critical documents, and always claimed to have put in place the perfect plan for the future. Yet the Performance Report could be different. It attempts to set quantifiable targets against which success can be measured. It ought, if used honestly,  be a way of seeing where investment is needed and where the troubled areas are. It may be that the internal reports are a little more objective. There is a hint of this in the summary of how the 42 Defence agencies had performed over the year. In 1998/99 they  met on average 78% of their key targets; for 1999/2000  they were down to 72%. It may be that Kosovo was the reason, or it may be that life is getting more difficult.</p>
			<p>Some of the targets seem less challenging than others. The fact that the Royal Navy managed to reduce its frontline by 3 frigates  seems hardly worth a special entry for achievement. Similarly the reduction of the RAF frontline by 36 aircraft is not the sort of target that one would want to  meet too frequently. There is a tendency throughout the document to give the impression that having a cunning plan is as good as implementing remedial action.</p>
			<p>Nevertheless, the Performance Report  is a useful reference work. If you want to see the latest organisational arrangements for the MOD, where all the forces are deployed, what the future equipment projects are then this is a good &pound;12.75 worth. Even better you can find it on the MOD web site if you search hard enough. One might almost think they want to keep it out of view.</p>
