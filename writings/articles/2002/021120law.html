			<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">International law and the laws of war are increasingly important to the military. Today&#146;s military operations must take into account the need for legitimacy if the military are not to be liable to subsequent prosecution. In addition, the conduct of warfare remains bound by a number of international agreements. In particular the Geneva Conventions, the Protocols and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights must be observed. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Recent moves by the USA have given rise to concerns as to whether the single superpower is prepared to remain constrained by this web of rules. Abandonment of  these rules will not be helpful in the long term.</font></p>

			<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The International Criminal Court (ICC) is a permanent court capable of investigating and trying individuals accused of the most serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law, namely war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. Unlike the International Court of Justice, whose jurisdiction is restricted to states, the ICC considers cases against individuals; and unlike the Tribunals for Rwanda and the Former Yugoslavia, created to address crimes committed during these conflicts, its jurisdiction is not situation specific and is not retroactive.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The International Criminal Court has been created on the basis of the Rome Statute, a treaty which was adopted by 120 nations voting in favor, 7 in opposition (with 21 abstentions), on July 17, 1998 in Rome at the United Nations Diplomatic Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Establishment of an International Criminal Court. On 11 April 2002, the Rome Statute received the 60 ratifications necessary for its entry into force, which then occurred on 1 July 2002. By mid November 2002, the total number of ratifications is 83. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Now that entry into force has occurred, in many ways the real work is just beginning. The Assembly of States Parties, the body composed of ratifying countries that will provide administrative oversight and other support for the Court, has begun to meet. Key officials will be put in place over a period of many months, and the Court is expected to begin its work by mid-2003. During this phase, civil society will focus in particular on ensuring that the nominations and elections of judges and other officials are conducted in a fair and transparent manner that respects the requirements in the Rome Statute.</font></p>

			<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">U.S. statement to General Assembly Sixth Committee 15 Oct 2002</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">In making the effort to ensure that U.S. citizens are not brought before the International Criminal Court, the United States does not seek to undermine the International Criminal Court, the general counsel to the U.S. Mission to the United Nations said October 14.<br>
					<br>
					In a speech to the General Assembly's sixth committee, which deals with legal matters, Nicholas Rostow explained the U.S. position on the court.</font></p>
			<ul>
				<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">&quot;The United States is concerned about the danger of politically motivated prosecutions,&quot; Rostow said. &quot;Examples of investigations or prosecutions based on political agenda, not evidence and neutral prosecutorial judgement abound. The structure of the ICC makes such unacceptable proceedings possible.&quot;</font>
			</ul>
			<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Rostow also said that the Rome Statute, which established the ICC, provides insufficient opportunity for Security Council oversight. United States has never recognized the right of an international organization to try non-citizens without Security Council mandate or oversight, he noted.</font></p>

			<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Judge Rules Detainees Have No Legal Right in U.S. Courts ((May be held indefinitely at Guantanamo Bay))<br>
					2 August 2002</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">(Distributed by the Office of International Information Programs, U.S. Department of State. Web site: <a href="http://usinfo.state.gov">http://usinfo.state.gov</a>)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Washington -- The U.S. government can continue to detain indefinitely the suspected terrorists being held at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, following a federal judge's ruling July 31.<br>
					<br>
					In a case brought by two British citizens, two Australians and 12 Kuwaitis who were captured in Afghanistan while fighting with Taliban and al-Qaida forces, U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly issued a 34-page ruling that the U.S. legal system has no jurisdiction over detainees held in Cuba.<br>
					<br>
					Ruling for the first time on U.S. federal jurisdiction over detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba since September 11, Judge Kollar-Kotelly concluded that the base is outside the sovereign territory of the United States. Based on a 1950 decision that held that writs of habeas corpus are not available to aliens held outside the sovereign territory of the United States, the court found that it &quot;did not have jurisdiction to consider the constitutional claims of the petitioners,&quot; who argued that they are entitled to be charged and to have access to attorneys and trial dates.<br>
					<br>
					The court asserted that its opinion &quot;should not be read as stating that these aliens don't have some form of rights under international law,&quot; but that their nationalities and geographic location outside the sovereign territory of the United States mean they do not have the right to press their cases in U.S. courts.<br>
					<br>
					The plaintiffs had argued unsuccessfully that U.S.-leased military bases abroad, &quot;which continue under the sovereignty of foreign nations, hostile or friendly, are functionally equivalent to being land borders or ports of entry of the United States or otherwise within the United States.&quot;<br>
					<br>
					Since the detainees have not been charged with any legal offenses, they are not being deprived of due process, the judge added.<br>
					<br>
					There are currently close to 600 suspected terrorists from around 36 countries detained at Guantanamo Bay. Many detainees were captured in Afghanistan or Pakistan by U.S. forces who were pursuing Taliban or al-Qaida members. Others were turned over to the United States by nations or forces on the suspicion of links to terrorist activities.</font></p>
			<h4><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Human Rights Watch Protest</font></h4>
			<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Human Rights Watch letter to Condoleeza Rice May 2002</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><a href="http://www.hrw.org/press/2002/05/guantanamo.htm">http://www.hrw.org/press/2002/05/guantanamo.htm</a></font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Human Rights Watch warned that the US administration had a responsibility not to transfer or repatriate detainees to countries where they may be at risk of torture. The U.S. government has not returned prisoners it captured in Afghanistan to China, for instance, and this policy needs to be applied more widely. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The points raised in the letter include: </font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Despite President Bush's claim to be applying the &quot;principles&quot; of the Third Geneva Convention regulating prisoner-of-war (POW) status, the United States continues to violate the Geneva Conventions, particularly with respect to Taliban detainees. This shortsighted transgression sets a dangerous precedent that could come back to haunt U.S. and allied servicemembers who are captured by enemy forces in this or future wars. Washington's refusal to treat the detainees as POWs is perplexing because it would in no way inhibit legitimate U.S. efforts to interrogate or prosecute people who have participated in terrorist acts. <br>
					<br>
					There is no legal basis to treat as &quot;battlefield detainees&quot; suspects who are captured outside Afghanistan and have no direct relationship with the armed conflict. In such cases, the designation is a transparent effort to circumvent the requirement of international human rights law that these suspects be criminally charged or freed. <br>
					<br>
					New regulations address many of the faults in President Bush's proposed military commissions, but flaws remain, including the failure to provide appeal to a civilian court, such as the appeal allowed in courts-martial to the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. The lack of independent appeal allows the executive to serve as both prosecutor and judge, undermining public confidence in the proceedings and increasing the possibility of injustice. <br>
					<br>
					It could be appropriate to prosecute the Guantanamo detainees for the crime of conspiracy if a suspect can be shown to have joined a criminal enterprise knowing of its criminal purpose and with the intent of furthering its criminal objectives. But it would be dangerous to apply conspiracy theories too loosely. Given the variety of reasons that Afghans and foreigners joined the Taliban, membership in a criminal conspiracy should not be presumed from mere armed presence in Afghanistan. <br>
					<br>
					The Geneva Conventions permit many of the detainees to be held until the end of active hostilities. But at some stage the genuine armed conflict in Afghanistan will give way to a rhetorical war - more akin to law enforcement efforts against other criminal activity, such as drug trafficking or the mafia, that also involves potential loss of life. At that point, detention without criminal charges is no more appropriate for the Guantanamo detainees than it would be for a street-level drug dealer picked up in any American city. <br>
					<br>
					The U.S. government has a duty to avoid transferring or assisting in the transfer of any detainee to a country where he risks torture. Violation of this duty carries criminal penalties enforceable in principle in any court worldwide.</font></p>
