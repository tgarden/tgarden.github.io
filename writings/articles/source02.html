<P>	Defence Reviews (whether given formal Review status or not)
have 3 phases. First, the bright young things of the MOD (ministers,
military and officials) busy themselves with developing clever
initiatives,which they are absolutely convinced will produce greater
effectiveness at lower cost. These are mixed with a leavening of
sensible evolutionary management fixes, which combine low risk with
modest savings. At the appointed hour, a fanfare of trumpets
announces the most successful and radical review ever. The second
phase - the implementation -  is long and hard and much less
exciting. Now the bright ideas have to be turned into reality, and
that must be done without losing the already assumed benefits of the
evolutionary measures. Finally, the difference between assumptions
and reality become so stark that the only solution is the third
phase: a new Review. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Will the Strategic Defence Review (SDR), published in July
1998, suffer the fate of its predecessors? Certainly there is more
hope that the prolonged consultation process means that it has
probably been constructed on a more reliable risk  assessment than
has been the case in the past. We are now well into the hard grind of
implementation, and this period is also more likely to be successful
given that the hounds of the Treasury are to be kept muzzled for the
next two years. Nevertheless, there are a number of areas where the
time is short and the risk is high. The areas of greatest risk are
smart  procurement, joint logistics, efficiency savings, defence
lands and manpower. In the longer term, the decision to provide two
new large aircraft carriers with a complement of new aircraft will
undoubtedly bring resource difficulties, but this is not yet a major
concern.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Smart Procurement  was a key aspect of the SDR, although work
had started ahead of the Review. Equipment  expenditure is set to
rise from &#163;6 billion in the current year to about &#163;6.8
billion in 2001/02. Smart procurement is assumed to make the
relatively modest savings of &#163;2 billion over the next 10 years. 
This figure is scarcely different from the 3% efficiency savings that
the department is expected to make without major organisational
change. The test of how well smart procurement is working will be in
delivery of equipment into service on time, to price and on
specification. It may be that the greater delegation of authority,
and the more intimate involvement by industry will help. However,
there are those that worry that such changes could as easily increase
the risks of projects running over cost and time. It will be an area
that will require very careful performance monitoring. For the
moment, progress seems to be satisfactory and the process has good
visibility.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	The establishment of a powerful post of Chief Of Defence
Logistics, with General Sir Sam Cowan in the hot seat, signalled a
revolutionary change in the logistics support for the three Services.
The time scales for the melding of the three areas into one is
relatively short and the complexity of the task is very high. The SDR
has not assumed early savings from the rationalisation of three
logistics organisations. This does not necessarily make it a low risk
area, as previous experience suggests that such rationalisation can
result in significant unplanned costs. When the Front Line First
Review proposed a rationalisation of officer staff training, it was
initially expected to result in modest savings. This relatively
simple project has in the event turned into a  high cost measure,
which also resulted in some very difficult political issues over the
disposal of Greenwich. The time scales have extended, and an
expensive temporary solution at Bracknell added to the cost and
inefficiencies. The logistics organisations are much more complex.
They have each been struggling with modernising their IT systems. It
would be unwise to expect this project to be completed on time and
without significant unplanned extra expenditure.  The Defence Select
Committee, in their report on the SDR, indicated that they would be
monitoring progress, but gave little detail on how they would measure
success.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Since the late 1980s, the MOD has undertaken to provide
efficiency measures each year. The figure has varied but has been of
the order of 3% per annum for most of the last 10 years. By its
nature, such a target  becomes progressively more difficult to
achieve. The most obvious, and least painful efficiency gains are
taken in the early years. As the room for manoeuvre decreases, the
efficiency exercise turns into a savings exercise. Budget holders are
expected to find the necessary cuts, and inefficiency is likely to
increase. Staff effort is wasted in creative accounting to ensure
that efficiency targets are met. The problem is compounded when major
changes are also taking place as a result of Review initiatives.
Efficiency measures, which are designed to have early effect, may cut
across the longer term proposals and in the end drive up costs. They
can also have a significant negative effect on morale as they may
appear arbitrary and unfair to the troops who are affected. While the
efficiency measures do not have a high profile within the SDR, they
can cause political difficulties in unexpected ways as individual
illogical  cuts are highlighted in the media. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	The SDR assumes an income from estate disposals of &#163;700
million by 2001/02. This represents about double the normal rate. The
SDR will certainly throw up a number of extra sites for disposal, but
they will only be freed as the reorganisations (TA, logistics, joint
forces and others) take place. This means that the extra sales will
tend to bunch towards the end of the period. The risk is that the
property market may by then be considerably less buoyant than at the
time of the SDR. Additionally, other government departments are
increasingly looking to asset sales to balance their budgets. This
may make it more difficult to sell MOD sites quickly. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	The fifth, and perhaps greatest, high risk area for successful
implementation of the SDR is in the manpower area. It is already
clear that there are significant urgent manning problems in various
specialisations. Despite the reductions in combat aircraft numbers in
the SDR, the RAF will still be unable to provide sufficient fast jet
pilots to man its diminished fleet in the immediate future. The army
establishment was rightly increased in the SDR, but,  as it was
unable to man its previous establishment, this makes the recruiting
and retention problem more acute. Army recruiting figures appear 
reasonable, but retention gives little cause for comfort. The worthy
attempt  to repair the damage done in previous Reviews to the medical
services will be a challenging problem. In all these cases, extra
resources will be needed for recruiting, training and retention
measures. There is little evidence to suggest that sufficient
provision has been made.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	What does this somewhat gloomy analysis mean?  As Defence
Reviews go, the SDR was  better and more honest than most. 
Nevertheless, it seems set to follow the paths of its predecessors as
the true costs and problems emerge from the detailed implementation
work.This Review of course, as  all its predecessors did, assumes
level funding in the longer term. This is the most heroic assumption
of all.
