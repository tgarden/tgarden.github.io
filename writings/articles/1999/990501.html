<H3><CENTER>	Life Begins at 50 - A New Start for NATO?
</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER>by Sir Timothy Garden</CENTER></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	It turned out to be a very different celebration in Washington
at the end of April than the one that had originally been planned to
mark NATO's half century. For the past two years, staffs had been
working to put together an agenda which would give a new sense of
purpose to the Alliance for the future. The strategic concept that
had been agreed in 1991 after the end of the Cold War was in dire
need of a rewrite to reflect the new world order. The United States
was keen to see NATO acting more pro-actively to bring peace and
security beyond the immediate territories of the member nations. Some
Europeans were less enthusiastic about a  move away from the classic
collective security rationale for NATO. The United States was also
pushing hard for a more robust posture to counter the proliferation
of weapons of mass destruction around the world. The birthday party
would also in part be a celebration of the accession of the three new
members (Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic). Some European
nations had been pressing for announcements on a further tranche of
new members, but there was little enthusiasm from the United States
or the United Kingdom.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	In the event, the Summit was totally dominated by the Alliance
operations against Serbia. The launching of the air campaign had
overtaken the development of a new strategic concept for NATO.
Perhaps rather to the surprise a number of Alliance members,  it had
proved possible to get the governments of the 19 nations to agree to
conduct a full scale air offensive against another European state,
without a specific UN security council resolution authorising the use
of military force. The Washington Summit of NATO heads of government
met one month into the bombing campaign. In the first month of
Operation Allied Force, events had changed NATO's original war aims.
The acceleration of the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo had produced a
refugee humanitarian crisis. The many tales of atrocities to the
ethnic Albanians by Serb military and police forces had strengthened
the political will within NATO. The failure of the bombing to bring
Milosevic back to the negotiating table in first few days was causing
both politicians and commentators to ask what happens if NATO has to
secure Kosovo without an agreement from Serbia.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	The question of the circumstances under which NATO ground
forces would move into Kosovo has become a growing issue. In the
first week of the air campaign, NATO's leaders were strong in their
statements that ground forces would only be used after an agreement
had been made with all parties including the Serbian government.
Commentators (including the writer) criticised this policy on two
grounds. First, all military campaigns should be planned with 
appropriate provision for the worst case. The air campaign might work
on its own, but no one could be sure until it was tried. Since it
would take two or three months to assemble an appropriate ground
force in the region, the prudent military planner would want to start
building up such a force from the start of the bombing. Secondly, it
was clear from experience in Bosnia and during the Kosovo
negotiations, that the risk of loss of territory was the strongest
lever available to change behaviour in the Serbian leadership. Thus
it weakened the West's negotiating position if the taking of Kosovo
territory by force was discounted from the start. It has been
interesting to watch how the political language has changed as the
potential need for ground forces has dawned on NATO's political
leadership. By week three, George Robertson was talking about the
need for a permissive environment before NATO ground forces were put
in  to Kosovo. In the run up to the NATO summit, the British
Government was explaining that ground forces would go in only when
the Serbian forces were sufficiently degraded. Tony Blair arrived
early for the Washington Summit, and used the opportunity to make it
clear that he was prepared to go all the way in this operation, and
was looking for the rest of NATO to follow.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	So what ultimately was achieved at the Washington Summit? Aside
from the very important tactical decisions about the next steps in
Kosovo operation, the NATO leaders agreed on a number of strategic
priorities for the long term future of the Alliance. Most of these
were lost to the wider public in the noise of reporting about
Operation Allied Force. The official summit communique was summed up
as: "NATO says it will expand its numbers and its functions". It
announced that the 19 member countries had:</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
   <LI>-  approved an updated Strategic Concept;
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
   <LI>- reaffirmed our commitment to the enlargement process of the
   Alliance and approved a Membership Action Plan for countries
   wishing to join;
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
   <LI>- completed the work on key elements of the Berlin Decisions
   on building the European Security and Defence Identity within the
   Alliance and decided to further enhance its effectiveness;
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
   <LI>- launched the Defence Capabilities Initiative;
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
   <LI>- intensified relations with Partners through an enhanced and
   more operational Partnership for Peace and strengthened
   consultations and co-operation within the Euro-Atlantic
   Partnership Council;
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
   <LI>- enhanced the Mediterranean Dialogue; and
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
   <LI>- decided to increase Alliance efforts against weapons of mass
   destruction and their means of delivery.
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>These seven elements are all important for the future of NATO. 
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
   <LI>The Strategic Concept is an 18 page document, which recognises
   the changes in the strategic environment since the 1991 concept
   was produced. The main elements are:
   
   <LI>-- Collective Defence: The Strategic Concept underscores the
   enduring core mission of NATO as the collective defence of its
   members under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty.
   
   <LI>-- Military Capabilities: The Concept reaffirms Allies'
   determination to strengthen Alliance defence capabilities by
   ensuring forces that are more mobile, sustainable, survivable and
   able to engage effectively on the full spectrum of NATO missions.
   
   <LI>-- New Missions: The Concept calls for improvements in NATO's
   capability to undertake new missions to respond to a broad
   spectrum of possible threats to Alliance common interests,
   including: regional conflicts, such as in Kosovo and Bosnia; the
   proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of
   delivery; and transnational threats like terrorism.
   
   <LI>-- New Members: The Concept underscores NATO's continued
   openness to new members and Allies' commitment to enlargement as
   part of a broader effort to enhance peace and stability throughout
   the Euro-Atlantic community.
   
   <LI>-- Strengthened Partnerships: The Concept reinforces Alliance
   efforts to build wide-ranging partnerships with the aim of
   increasing transparency and mutual confidence in security matters
   and enhancing the capacity of allies and partners to act together.
   
   <LI>-- European Capabilities: The Concept highlights development
   of a European Security and Defense Identity within NATO as an
   essential element of NATO's ongoing adaptation, enabling European
   allies to makea more effective contribution to Euro-Atlantic
   security.

<P>	The summit had a very different tone from the celebration that
had be planned. The staff work to produce all these new initiatives
has been difficult over the past months. However the focus of NATO on
the current challenges of Kosovo in some ways eased the passage of
all these new undertakings. All the leaders were clear that the new
Concept was being forged in the Balkans even as they were issuing the
communique on 24 April. If NATO is able to resolve Kosovo
satisfactorily over the coming months, the new Concept is likely to
be a good building block for the future. If NATO were to  fail, the
promises of the Washington Summit would be consigned to history, and
the future of the Alliance itself would be in question. </P>
