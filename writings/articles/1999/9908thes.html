<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	In 1979 more than 60 people died of
anthrax in Sverdlovsk over a period of 6 weeks. Five years later, 751
people suffered food poisoning from eating from restaurant salad bars
in a small town called The Dalles in Oregon. We now know that the
deaths in the Soviet Union were caused by a very small accidental
release of anthrax spores from a biological weapons plant, while the
American salmonella outbreak was caused by deliberate bacterial
contamination  of food by a religious cult. Biological weapons are
not new, but they are becoming more attractive to a number of players
on the international security scene.  The United States Government is
particularly concerned by the potential threat that it faces from a
wide range of possible adversaries in this  area. Joshua Lederberg,
the Nobel Laureate in Medicine, has collected together  some 15
academic papers on various aspects of the biological weapon threat as
perceived from the USA. There is considerable overlap between
authors, but a consistent gloomy message emerges: the danger is real
and there are no totally effective countermeasures. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Most historical reviews of biological
warfare start by citing the use of plague victims' bodies by the
Tatars in 1346 as catapult projectiles against the hapless
inhabitants of Kaffa. The city was conquered when  an outbreak of
plague caused the citizens to flee. Whether the  infected bodies were
the cause of victory is less certain, given that the fleas which
transmit plague prefer living bodies. It is more likely that they
would have infected the catapult operators than the townspeople of
Kaffa. The example highlights the difficulties of effective use of
biological agents for warfighting. Disease is never instantaneous in
effect, nor is it entirely predictable in its transmission.  In 1763,
the British used smallpox infected blankets to try to reduce the
Native Americans in the Ohio River valley. While there were smallpox
epidemics among the tribes people, it is more likely that they were
caused by the normal respiratory droplet transmission coupled with
the Indian's lack of natural immunity.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	As with many mass killing methods, it was
not until this century that scientific advances coupled with
industrial production techniques made biological warfare  a realistic
concept. Germany had an ambitious programme running throughout World
War I and targeted the mules and horses of the Allies with anthrax.
However, chemical warfare was much more favoured because it could
incapacitate troops quickly. After the war, bacteriological warfare
was grouped with chemical in the international efforts to limit the
use of indiscriminate weapons. The 1925 Geneva Protocol prohibited
the use of biological weapons, but  did not prohibit research or
possession; it was not until 50 years later that the US ratified the
Protocol. The experience in World War II was mixed. Hitler had
prohibited biological weapons development until 1943, and the Allies
continued their own development programmes for retaliatory use if
necessary. Only the Japanese carried out both a major development
programme and large scale attacks with these novel weapons. Cultures
of various bacterial agents were sprayed from aircraft. In one of the
more hazardous systems described in this book, fleas were bred and
allowed to feed on plague infected rats. The fleas were then released
from aircraft over Chinese cities. Each attack required the release
of 15 million infected fleas which must have made the pilots feel
that they deserved equal status with their Kamikaze colleagues. The
Japanese suffered some 10,000 casualties and 1700 deaths in 1941 from
their own biological weapons. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Despite the confirmation that biological
weapons were of dubious military utility, the Cold War accelerated
their development. Large scale production was undertaken by the USSR,
and the Korean War gave an impetus to production in the US. For those
of us engaged in military planning during the Cold War, there never
seemed to be any scenario where the use of biological weapons would
make any tactical sense.  In 1969, Britain made a proposal to the
United Nations to prohibit the development, production and
stockpiling of biological weapons. The Warsaw Pact nations supported
the proposal, with the proviso that the provision for inspections of
suspect facilities should be dropped. The 1972 treaty came into force
three years later, by which time the United States had destroyed all
of its biological arsenal. If UN Conventions were universally
observed that should have meant an end to the threat of biological
warfare between States. The signatories to the 1972 Biological
Weapons Convention included  the Soviet Union and Iraq. As we now
know, both pursued their programmes actively. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The accident  in Sverdlovsk is well
documented in the book.  For a short time on 2 April 1979 some air
filters at a biological warfare research facility were accidentally
turned off. Anthrax spores escaped and were blown southwards by the
wind. Those who were infected and died over the following six weeks
were all living or working within a narrow 4 km corridor downwind of
the facility. Livestock were infected up to 50 km from the leak. If a
minor filtration problem can cause this degree of infection, it is
easy to imagine what destruction a deliberate offensive use of
anthrax might cause. Of the various case studies considered in the
book, there is a particularly chilling footnote referring to a piece
of US Department of Defense mathematical modelling. This deduces that
a single drone carrying 6.5 kg of anthrax could produce a cloud over
an entire city which would cause deaths of several hundreds of
thousands of people within 72 hours. While slower, the total kill
rate is higher than that for a single nuclear weapon. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The potential of biological agents as
strategic weapons has not been lost on Saddam Hussein in Iraq. While
the UNSCOM inspection team have been fairly successful in destroying
his nuclear and chemical warfare capacity, they are less certain how
well they have done in reducing his ability to manufacture biological
weapons. Two chapters by different authors come to the conclusion
that Iraq is still intent on  achieving a strategic capability using
weapons of mass destruction, and that it is more likely to be
successful through its biological warfare research programmes.  While
the number of potential nuclear weapon states in the world has
declined in recent years, the number of states which seem to be
developing a capability for the strategic use of biological weapons
has been increasing. The biological weapon is sometimes described as
the poor man's atom bomb. Certainly its manufacture is far simpler
than that of a nuclear weapon. The process can also be hidden more
easily, as commercial biomedical factories can be used to produce the
pathogens. Delivery systems are required, but given the comparatively
small payload weight, they can be concealed more easily. States, like
Iraq, see a strategic biological weapon arsenal as a means of
standing up to the nuclear powers. As was seen in the Gulf War, this
can be a two edged sword. It is now clear that they had weaponised
biological agents, but they were deterred from using them by the
implicit threat of nuclear retaliation by the US or Israel. </FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The future threat from such weapons is
much more likely to be from non-state actors. Biological weapons are
relatively easy to produce, cause great  fear among the general
population,  and given the delay caused by the disease incubation
period are anonymous. This makes them attractive to terrorists,
anti-government groups, fanatics and deranged individuals. In these
cases classical deterrence cannot work. Can we determine whether an
outbreak of fatal food poisoning is caused by bad hygiene or
deliberate contamination? An anthrax epidemic would be suspicious,
but a particularly virulent influenza strain would be put down to
natural mutation. The book covers a surprising number of such cases.
It identifies the easy availability of pathogen cultures as one of
the problems.The case is cited of a white supremacist  who was able
to purchase a culture of the organism which is associated with
plague. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The subtitle of the book is "Limiting the
threat", and control of availability of  dangerous cultures is an
obvious recommendation. However, there are many potential killer
agents, and also many entirely legitimate uses for them. The need for
good intelligence is highlighted, but this will never be the complete
answer in a democratic society. These discomforting conclusions mean
that limiting the threat  may mean expending most effort on
preparation for coping with the outbreak of infection in order to
minimise loss of life. While, precautionary inoculation  against the
most likely biological warfare diseases may be possible for military
troops who are at direct risk, it is unlikely to be an effective or
desirable general approach. The key to defensive measures must be
early detection of a release of biological agents, and the book could
have addressed this topic in more depth. Biotechnology is offering
some prospect of fast reacting sensors, which can rapidly identify a
wide range of agents.  The universal wearing of a relatively
inexpensive protective mask is recommended as a way of reducing
civilian casualties from aerosol agents, such as anthrax, by several
orders of magnitude. Quick response medical teams, who are trained to
recognise a biological warfare event are also needed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Lederberg and his colleagues do not
address in any depth the question of the biological weapons of
tomorrow. The mapping of the human genome coupled with the wonders of
genetic engineering may offer some very unpleasant opportunities to
the biological weapon designer of the  next century. Combining the
speed and lethality  of the Ebola virus with the ease of transmission
of influenza would be bad enough. If such agents were then able to
target particular gene configurations, ethnic cleansing and genocide
could be pursued by dictators, fanatics and the insane in all too
efficient ways. Less this seem too fanciful, the book records a
particular expedition by 40 Aum Shinrikyo cult members to Zaire to
help in the Ebola virus outbreak of 1992. They failed in their aim to
collect samples of the deadly virus, and had to content themselves
with releasing the nerve agent sarin in the Tokyo subway three years
later.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	After Lederberg's ponderous and depressing
academic tome, "Crimes of War" looks remarkably glossy. The heavy
sans serif typeface on pages that mix black,  shades of beige and 
white, all interleaved with compelling photographs, makes for an
exciting visual effect. This is a book which seeks to make
international humanitarian law understandable  to everyone. The
editors point out that the laws of war are sometimes frustratingly
counterintuitive. It is possible for an aggressor to stage a war of
conquest while abiding by the Geneva Conventions, just as the doughty
defender can commit war crimes while defending his territory. The
book is arranged as an A-to-Z guide with some 140 separate articles
by journalists, academics, lawyers, military men and UN staff. Is it
possible that such a complex subject can be addressed satisfactorily
in this way? Turning to "B" for Biological Weapons, Terence Taylor of
the International Institute for Strategic Studies manages to capture
virtually all the major issues discussed in Lederberg's book in just
two  pages. He concentrates on the use of bacteria, viruses and
toxins as military weapons, and explains the evolution of the
Biological Weapons Convention with its strengths and weaknesses. He
takes the experience in Iraq as his case study.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	"Crimes of War" is designed to be a ready
reference book for journalists, aid workers and the general public.
It was published too soon to be able to refer to Kosovo for its
examples, and that allows the reader to test how useful it would have
been to inform the debate during the campaign.  The first question
which needed answering was whether intervention in Kosovo without a
specific UN mandate was legal. Turning to the article on Humanitarian
Intervention, David Rieff tells us that such intervention "is at once
an immensely powerful and a terribly imprecise idea"  He correctly
points to the influence of UN bureaucrats and aid workers as some of
the most fervent interventionists. Interestingly, he quotes Bernard
Kouchner (now in charge of the civil rebuilding of Kosovo) as
popularising the French legal theory of the right of intervention.
Rieff concludes that the tug of war between sovereignty and
intervention will continue to rage in international law circles.
Gaining no strong guidance from this section, the reader may turn to
"Gray Areas in International Humanitarian Law", but this centres on
how to define what is an armed conflict and whether it is internal or
international.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	When it comes to the conduct of the
campaign, the book is able to offer more concrete advice on every
aspect.  The series of NATO bombing errors caused agonising in the
Western media. Collateral Damage gets a page to itself.  While the
laws of armed conflict restrict indiscriminate attacks (another
article on these), there is no prohibition  per se on attacks which
expected to cause collateral damage, but the risk must be
proportional to the military purpose of the mission. The principle of
proportionality merits its own section, and reminds military
commanders of their responsibilities to update target lists in the
light of civilian movements. Two targets during the Kosovo air
campaign caused more argument than any others. The first was the
deliberate targeting of Serbian television studios, and the second
was the accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. Gaby
Rado addresses the question of legitimate military targets, and uses
the Bosnian Serb attack on Sarajevo television studios as an example:
"Unbeknownst to most television reporters, customary law long ago
deemed radio and television stations to be military objectives".
While it is a war crime to attack anything that is not a legitimate
military target, the list of such targets is long and includes
factories producing transport, and electricity plants which produce
power for mainly military consumption. The legitimacy of particular
weapons is a rich area for debate. However, a reader who follows the
index entry for cluster bombs will be disappointed to find no direct
assessment of them. The targeting mistake which led to the bombing of
the Chinese embassy will surely feature in future editions of this
volume.Nevertheless in the section on wilfulness, we are reminded 
that a military commander  commits no crime if he causes civilian
deaths because of faulty target intelligence.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">There is a wealth of information applicable
to the criminal conduct of the Serbs in Kosovo. Dipping into Roger
Cohen's piece on ethnic cleansing directs the reader to torture,
extrajudicial executions, rape, human shields, crimes against
humanity and genocide. Each of these sections takes one deeper into
the horrors that made Kosovo a justifiable humanitarian intervention
operation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	War crimes are not something new, but the
eagerness of the international community to do something about them
is a welcome recent development. The establishment of the
international  tribunal in 1993 to try those accused of war crimes in
the former republic of Yugoslavia was a massive step forward in
giving international humanitarian law some teeth. The process is slow
and unwieldy, but the war criminals of Bosnia are now being brought
to justice. It is likely that the process will be pursued more
vigorously in the aftermath of Kosovo. There has certainly been more
awareness of the need to document evidence before it disappears. But
the ad hoc tribunals for Yugoslavia and  for Rwanda are inadequate
for the global policing of war crimes. The move towards an
International Criminal Court is a first tentative step towards
addressing the extraordinary range of crimes that are documented so
graphically in this book. It is unfortunate that the US is so opposed
to the concept on the grounds that it is not prepared to allow
jurisdiction over its own citizens. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Gutman and Rieff have produced an important
book. It is accessible to the ordinary reader and turns difficult
international legal concepts into digestible articles. Importantly,
the analysis is as objective as is possible in a field so full of
passion and outrage. The text remains cool, while the black and white
photographs drive home the horrors of war crimes. It is a book which
should be available to ordinary soldiers during training. There is
even an entry on the topic of training in international humanitarian
law. In it, Michael Hoffman suggests that civil and military leaders,
who claim  that their forces obey the laws of war, should be asked
what training their troops receive. The 1949 Geneva Conventions
require States to include the study of international humanitarian law
in "programmes of military and, if possible, civil instruction, so
that the principles thereof may become known to the entire
population". On this basis,  the Laws of War should be a part of the
national curriculum.  Certainly, it should be on the bookshelf  of
every prime minister, defence minister and foreign secretary. It
would make useful reading before having to go on live worldwide
television to defend the military actions of democratic countries
which have embarked on humanitarian intervention. There is a growing
body of international law which can allow good to triumph over evil,
but there will be times when a totalitarian opposition seems to have
all the advantages. Kosovo has shown that successful humanitarian
intervention is difficult but possible, and has advanced the rule of
international law as a result.</FONT></P>
