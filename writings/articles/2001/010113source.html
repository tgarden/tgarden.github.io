			<h3>Hague takes a view on Missile Defence</h3>

			<p>It is clear that the new Bush administration will push ahead with development of a system designed to protect the whole of the United States from a limited ballistic missile attack. What is not yet known is how this National Missile Defence (NMD) will work. Even the most enthusiastic proponents see it as a project which will stretch over at least 5 years and probably many more. The few potential weapon system components that have been tested so far have had very mixed results. There is considerable technical debate over different interception weapon systems. However there are a number of difficult issues which will arise for the British Government regardless of the system ultimately deployed.</p>
			<p>All proposed systems depend on early warning of a missile launch, and tracking of the missile after launch. The launch detection is to be achieved by infra-red sensors in space, and the data has to be relayed through ground stations around the world. As part of the close US/UK relationship, one of those ground stations is located in Britain at Menwith Hill. The tracking of the missiles will be done by new X-band radars located at convenient points around the world on possible flight paths. The early warning site at Fylingdales had a similar role when the threat was of a missile attack from the Soviet Union. It is expected that the US government will wish to upgrade the radar site there as part of any NMD development.  </p>
			<p>The necessary changes at Menwith Hill and at Fylingdales would not be permitted under the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty as currently agreed. The Bush administration believes that it will be possible to renegotiate the ABM treaty with Russia (probably at a price). Otherwise they may decide to withdraw from the treaty at six months notice, as they are legally entitled to do. All of this means that the British government will have to take a view on the arms control implications of any requests that the US may make for upgrades. It is likely that the facilities on the British mainland would become attractive targets for future hostile powers, which might seek to disable the US defences. Apart from Denmark, which also has an early warning site responsibility, other European countries have less direct influence on US proposals. Nevertheless, they are uneasy about the implications for Russian and Chinese missile plans. Nor does Europe see NMD as the best way to counter the different potential proliferators. The British all party Foreign Affairs Select Committee came to the same conclusion last July.</p>
			<p>Into this complex and internationally sensitive debate, William Hague has thrown his unquestioning support behind the concept of US NMD. While the Bush administration may be grateful for some political support for the idea from this side of the Atlantic, it is doubtful that they want it to become a polarised debate before a British general election. Tony Blair has been playing it long. The official government line is that they have not taken a view because no requests have been received from the US. Officials will have been making it clear that they would rather not have a request for a Fylingdales upgrade ahead of the election. Hague has presumably decided that the issue is worth raising as it will put Blair in a very difficult position. He can continue to refuse to take a position and appear indecisive. He can come out against NMD and offend the new Bush administration. Or he can come out for NMD and offend his European allies, Russia and China. This may seem like clever politics, but it is hardly in the long term national interest.</p>
