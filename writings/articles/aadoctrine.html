<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	I always enjoy my visits to the talk to the ASC - I suppose I
became hooked on it during my tour as Director of Defence Studies in
the early 80's.  Of course it was a delight to be able to cover the
wide air power remit, drawing lessons from the past, hinting at ways
thing could be done better today, and offering the picture of the
wonders of tomorrow which were there for the asking. Life was made
even easier for me because I had a real and powerful enemy from which
I could weave a convincing threat scenario, and a Government which
was increasing resources for Defence at a rate of some 3% per year in
real terms. But today those chickens come home to roost: Group
Captain Andy Vallance, your current Director of Defence Studies, has
given you the broad conceptual structure of air power theory,  the
former of Head of the Air Historical Branch and the former Commandant
of RCDS have given you analysis of historical campaigns a plenty, and
you have exercised the use of air power in relatively modern
campaigns during Bellum.  You are now bubbling over, I hope, with
what air power can do, and how we should use it for greatest effect. 
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Next year this phase will be able to draw on the lessons of the
Gulf - a fitting climax to any air power phase. Already the pundits
and professors have started the wash-up.  Lawrence Freedman,
Professor of War Studies at Kings London, writing in the Independent
on 1 March said:</P>

<P>But if any one lesson can be drawn from this war it is this: that
it is impossible to conduct a ground war having conceded command of
the air to the enemy.  The allies were always able to fight in three
dimensions while Iraq was confined to only two.  Those responsible
for planning Western armed forces in the light of the end of the Cold
War will now seek to ensure that superiority in air power is never
lost.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Or Mark Urban, who in the past has never been seen as a friend of
the air force, but whose experiences in the Gulf seem to have
transformed as if on the road to Damascus, writing in the Independant
on Sunday on 3 March:</P>

<P>After decades of promising but failing to deliver, air chiefs have
finally produced a virtually costless victory over a major land
power.</P>

<P>The effects of this war on the prestige and budgets of air arms
around the world are likely to be fundamental.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Two views in the immediate afterglow of victory, each indicating
some sea change in their perspective of the relative importance of
air power in the future, and pointing to changes in plans. It is
against this background that we need to talk about the real world of
the air force plans.  What we have today is a result of the work of
our predecessors'  over the past two decades, and changes that we
make in plans and programmes today may not take effect for many
years.  How does the theoretical philosophical academic shopping list
of air power doctrine get translated into the front line, weapon
stocks, training and operational concepts?  The answer is that it is
done by you and your colleagues in hundreds of different places. 
Much of the year you spend here will be directed towards giving you
the tools you need to translate the philosophy of air power into the
practice of air power.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	A clear view of what air power can achieve is essential if we
are to be able to argue for the force structure we need, but there
must also be a clear view of what force structure is realistically
achievable, and a modification in our conceptual thinking to take
account of that.  I shall try to give you a flavour for the
constraints of the real world, how we manage them, and thus how we
develop a force structure and doctrine for the Royal Air Force which
offers the best prospects for utility against the uncertainties of
the future. I shall be dealing with the higher policy development
rather than the important but lower level tactical doctrine issues.
Nevertheless, we need to see first whether the short history of the
development of air forces has any lessons for us.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Historical lessons</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	I shall not spend long on the past, but that does not mean that
there are not many important lessons for us. The great days of the
air power doctrinal thinkers were in the interwar period. Drawing on
remarkably little experience of strategic bombing, they developed a
doctrine which was to convince the highest political level. Baldwin
reminded the House in November 1932 that:</P>

<P>I think it is well also for the man in the street to realise that
there is no power on earth that can prevent him from being bombed. 
Whatever people may tell him, the bomber will always get through. The
only defence is offence, which means you have to kill more women and
children more quickly than the enemy if you want to save yourselves.
</P>

<P>I quote that passage to show what can happen if you have an
absolute conviction about air power doctrine and can convince your
political masters.  The push for the development of an effective air
defence capability was left until the mid 30's, and while academics
differ over where to give most credit - Tizard's Aeronautical
Research Committee ( civilian scientists); Camm and Mitchell and
industry; and even the Treasury; the air power doctrine thinkers of
the 30's can claim little credit for preparing for the Battle of
Britain.  Last week I listened to Correlli Barnett and John Terraine,
both eminent military historians arguing at the RUSI about the
relative priorities given to Bomber Command and Costal Command in the
last war. Even with the benefits of 50 years of hindsight some of the
choices still remain difficult. The immediate post-war period had a
similar development of a strong single-minded air power doctrine from
limited evidence. The jet nuclear bomber appeared to give the
capability which the strategic bombing enthusiasts had wanted in the
20's.  While in military absolutes such thinking was perhaps more
logical after Hiroshima than it had been after the 1917 Gotha raids
over London, it did not take into account the political constraints
on the utility of nuclear weapons. For the narrow, yet crucial, role
of nuclear deterrence against another nuclear-armed adversary, second
strike survivability would be the key, and ultimately the sea would
prove a better refuge for the strategic deterrent than would an
airfield. The importance of a future conventional bomber threat
against the UK was not appreciated in the 1957 Sandys review.  </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	I could go on, but I do not want to dwell on the past except to
use it as a warning against too narrow thinking, and extrapolating
dangerous doctrines from limited experience in the last conflict -
perhaps we will need to remember this carefully in the coming months.
 Let me turn to the real life factors which we must consider in
determining the Royal Air Force frontline. I use the size and shape
of the frontline as my standard  because it is real and tangible, it
allows us to implement our current doctrine, and is the basis for our
development of future doctrine.	</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Real-life determining factors</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	There are a number of factors which we must pull together if we
are to examine the art of the possible, and make sure that our
beliefs in the employment of air power are reflected in our
operational equipment.  They are:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Threat
   
   <LI>Current force structure
   
   <LI>Resources
   
   <LI>Political will
   
   <LI>Technology
   
   <LI>Operational Analysis
   
   <LI>Future Concepts
   
   <LI>Threat Scenario
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Our first key consideration is the nature of the threat. How
easy it was when we could start each analysis of air power
requirements with the classic Warsaw Pact versus NATO bar charts. 
But we are in a very much less certain world now. Two ASCs ago at
this stage of the course, they were looking at a security picture
with an Inner German Border, a cohesive Warsaw Pact, and the start of
what seemed some rather overly optimistic conventional arms control
proposals.  Last year's course had seen the breaching of the Berlin
Wall, the optimism of what CFE might achieve, and the prospect of a
rundown of military requirement. You have arrived with Germany
unified, The Warsaw Pact dead, CFE in some difficulty, the Soviet
Union in disarray - and maybe in dangerous disarray, and a classic
small OOA conflict just finished.  The Gulf War - unpredicted until
the invasion of Kuwait last August is just the half pillar war that
always got a mention in the White Papers as coming out of the hide of
our NATO assigned forces.  While the NATO requirement looks as though
it is decreasing, yet this OOA conflict has absorbed much of our old
style order of battle.  How then are we going to plan in the future?
What are the battles in which air power will be required to play a
part? </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Europe and NATO</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Looking first at where our thinking must start - at Home. We
face a changing Europe and a developing NATO.  I do not doubt that
you will spend much of the course discussing the way ahead in Europe
- and my forecasts are as likely to be overtaken by events as yours. 
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P> However let me set some fixed points. Firstly, whatever the
instabilities and problems of the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe,from a security point of view the West is much better placed
now than it was 2 years ago, and indeed better than it envisaged it
would be under CFE. What was the most dangerous part of Europe, the
IGB is no more. The Soviet Buffer states of Eastern Europe are now
buffer states for the West - the Warsaw Pact is no more. It would
take some considerable time for the Soviet Union to get back to the
position it was, and it could not do it covertly. Thus the all out
attack within 48 hours is no longer possible. But smaller operations
are still possible at short notice, and may be more likely given the
ethnic and other problems. Nor must we discount the longer notice
scenario. The Soviet Union will remain a heavily armed, both nuclear
and conventional, (and we are already seeing disturbing statements
about Soviet lessons from the Gulf) power sitting on the edge of
Europe. To ignore such military capability would be unwise, and in
time would lead to the Soviet Union - or what remains at its centre -
being able to influence western european policy.  So we will need a
continuing Alliance structure in Europe - and NATO seems the most
sensible one - but who knows with talk of the WEU, and even the EC.
Your Commandant and I were listening to Jacques Delors last week
giving his vision of a common security arrangement for Europe - this
may be some time coming.  From a national perspective we can define a
threat, now reduced in some areas, and changed in nature in others to
become less predictable and more mobile, which will be easier faced
as part of a collective security arrangement, but perhaps needs to be
considered if such alliances become no longer possible.</P>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Vestiges of Empire</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Outside of the NATO area of interest, we have continuing
vestiges of empire, but they are declining and I believe we will have
to plan on their continuing so to do.  Put in its most realpolitik,
we will use military means where we have the capability - such as the
Falklands, and will rely on diplomacy and accommodation where we do
not have the military capability to enforce our policies - and you
might take Hong Kong as an example of the latter.  But there is one
area of military interest so close to home that it cannot be ignored,
and that is Northern Ireland. I mention it to remind you that in
developing our air power doctrine - and our force structure - we must
not discount a theatre of operations merely because it is less
obviously an air campaign. It will require a share of resources which
will affect what we can do elsewhere.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Vital interests elsewhere</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Well, what about elsewhere? I suppose, I should be grateful for
the example that the Gulf War gives me now to wax lyrical about the
need for an out of area intervention capability, and the role that
air power has had to play.  I shall resist the temptation - there
will be plenty of opportunity for that when writing the Lessons up in
the coming months. Those lessons may be rather different from those
that the advocates of specialist OOA forces might wish. After all the
forces used have by and large been the NATO type forces, rather than
the more lightly equipped specialist forces. It may be that we can
draw lessons about the importance of rapid deployability of all our
forces - and here there will be air power contributions to make. But
for the moment, let me use the Gulf War as no more than an
illustration of the uncertainty of where, when and how we may be
required to deploy military force in the future. If the UN assumes a
greater role in the post Gulf new world order,  we could find
ourselves used more under their auspices.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Current force structure</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>If we start from a position of uncertainty over the nature of
current and future threats, we also start with one less than helpful
certainty and that is the current force structure.  Developed from
past (and therefore inevitably wrong) assumptions of the future,
modified by technological difficulties and constrained by resources.
But our doctrine must consider the reality of what we have. We cannot
replace the inventory overnight, or indeed make major changes (apart
from cancellation) to programmes in train for the next 5 years. We
can hedge our bets in a number of ways, by making sure that each
capability is as multi-purpose as possible, and by keeping a foot in
the door of every role where air power offers a unique contribution. 
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Here we can take heart from experience of the past. We have been
extraordinarily adapatable in the way we have used our inventory. The
very flexibility of air systems means that we can use them in
different ways as tactical doctrine changes. The Vulcan started as a
high level overland strategic bomber, was adapted to the low level
role in the light of the developing threat, and was finally used in
anger as a medium level conventional bomber. AAR has transformed the
reach of short range aircraft, but that does not mean that it is
sensible to rely exclusively on AAR if reach becomes a critical
factor for the future.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Resources</H3>

<P>	In the same way our force structure and hence our doctrine is
resource limited.  Against all these uncertainties of the future we
could make a perfectly respectable military case for a wider range of
capabilities, but  realism says that as the immediate threat of the
Warsaw Pact recedes we shall be facing constraints on resources. Such
constraints mean making choices. Those choices should provide the
most flexible capability. It is no good sinking all the defence money
into some super effective weapon system, which guarantees success in
today's favourite scenario. There were those who argued strongly for
conventional ballistic missiles to take over the offensive counter
air role in NATO in the early 80s. Had we sunk our money in such a
scheme, we might be regretting it now that the Soviet air bases are
much further back and could not be reached by such systems. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Perversely, resource constraints do give us a chance to shape
our forces in a more rapid way than is possible otherwise. While
procuring new equipment takes years, we can dispose of current
equipment almost overnight. Indeed the Options exercise - and any
Defence Review - provides an unusual opportunity for taking stock and
deciding what are the key capabilities for the future. In our work in
options we took a few key operational tenets: the preservation of all
roles even if this required multi-roling some forces; the
preservation of our nuclear delivery capability; the importance of UK
air defence; the preservation of key operational support capabilities
in both transport and tanker; focusing on the most survivable
airfields our reduced estate. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Political will</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Options bring me to the very important real world consideration of
the political will. We cannot operate an air power doctrine without
the blessing of our Ministers. Thus however good you might think say
an offensive chemical capability might be, it is politically
unacceptable and therefore not a part of our inventory. On the other
hand, political judgements are not made in a vacuum. The development
of defence policy is through consideration of the many strands of
military capability against security need. This is where the air
power conceptual thinking is important. You can kill a tank in many
ways: ranging from the infantry carried hand held ATGW, through tank
and artillery, to helicopter and fixed wing delivered systems. You
cannot afford them all, and thus judgements are needed - which will
be endorsed by politicians - as to the most effective way. It will be
no good for an air force to have a doctrine for killing tanks in such
and such a way, if the task  and equipment that Ministers are
prepared to endorse is exclusively surface to surface.</P>

<H3>Technology</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	If the threat is uncertain, and the resources constrained, we
must also consider one other difficulty in our development of
doctrine - that of technology. Continuing with my anti-armour example
for a moment.  We can develop ideas for killing tanks based on an
assumption that technology will provide us with a particular
stand-off weapon which has a multiple tank kill capability. We can
base our aircraft equipment procurement programme on this philosophy
- but behind it all will lie the worry as to whether technology will
deliver the weapon to specification, on time and on cost. If it
doesn't, it may be that our doctrine for killing tanks should have
been different.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Operational Analysis</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Decisions about concepts and procurement have to come from
weighing up all these factors.  Everyone would like conclusive proof
that their particular pet theory is the right one.  Such proof is
only available if and when war comes - the next best thing is thus
operational analysis.  But for operational analysis we have to make
assumptions about all these uncertain variables which I have been
talking about so far.  That is becoming increasingly difficult - and
the alternative of military judgement rarely convinces on its own.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Conceptual Thinking</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>That does not mean that we can abandon military judgement.  The
last of my many inputs into the future size and shape of the
frontline is that conceptual thinking which is air power doctrine.
You have covered over this week the key air power roles and the
principles with which air power is applied. I do not intend to repeat
this common ground. The question is whether the changes in train in
the strategic context, the economic backdrop and the technological
prospects mean that we should change our current air power strategy.
We seek to keep expertise and capability in all roles: offensive ,
defensive and support; conventional and nuclear; land and sea. We pay
the price of spreading the jam more thinly either reducing the
numbers in each role and thus increasing the overhead costs, or by
making forces less effective by double and triple hatting them. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Conclusion</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>So what can I draw together from all these factors in terms of our
current and future doctrine. For the Threat, it is less certain, less
immediately catastrophic in Europe, but increasingly high intensity
wherever conflict breaks out. That suggests that deployability,
range, speed of reaction, and flexibility are the sort of key words
we need to look for in threat response. The Royal Air Force today
provides a balanced capability across the roles. Reconnaissance will
remain  a key activity, and every operation in peace, TTW and war
reinforces the message that aircraft are a crucial part of the
intelligence picture. A year ago, every presentation that I gave
would be laced with Arms Control. We are less optimistic now, but in
any event, recce was going to have an increasing part to play in the
confidence building which is the essential companion of any arms
control regime. Gaining control of the air is the key to successful
land or sea operations. It is impossible to predict whether offensive
or defensive counter air will have the ascendancy in any operation -
and the capability for both is therefore needed. Rapid application of
massive firepower will be needed in any conflict. The arguments about
the balance between close air support, battlefield air inderdiction
and deep inderdiction are sterile. Each is necessary, and the balance
between them is a dynamic of the battle. If choices have to be made
between systems, then we must go for the ones that can cover all
three requirements. Deployment of firepower may be in the form of
troops delivered by fixed or rotary wing air power. Sufficient range
and endurance is necessary for the unknown scenario of the future,
and that means both tactical and strategic tanking. The substrategic
nuclear system is best controlled by being an air delivered system. 
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>So we need everything, but the reality of resource constraints say
we cannot have everything.  What then is the answer? It must be to
retain roles through multi-roling aircraft, designing aircraft and
weapons for multi-role capability. The current structure of the Royal
Air Force reflects this, the planning under options looked to retain
all the roles, and the procurement of EFA continues this pattern.  We
face a very uncertain world, and one in which flexibility - the key
characteristic of air power - will need to be exploited to the full.
