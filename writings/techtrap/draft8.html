<P><CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER></P>

<P>It is not strictly accurate to classify space technology as a
separate area for research. It is made up of a multitude of different
scientific disciplines. From the chemistry of rocket propellant,
through the mathematics of orbital calculations to the psychology of
isolation in zero gravity conditions, no area of modern science is
left unrepresented. It is however valid to consider it as a
collection of new technologies directed towards the common
exploitation of the vast region of the universe beyond our
atmosphere. The first satellite placed in orbit was Sputnik 1 in
October 1957. The implications for the strategic balance at the time
were profound. Yet in the 40 years that have followed, the military
exploitation of space has been more limited than early forecasts
predicted.(1) . As one expert has said "The Space Age fizzled because
the grand dreams turned out to be too expensive". (2)</P>

<P>A primary area for research was in the space vehicle provision.
Single shot ballistic rockets have assumed a vital role in nuclear
delivery, satellite emplacement, and have potential for conventional
warfare. In this respect civil and military needs have run in
parallel as the demands for communications satellites for civil use
have increased. That said, the military use has in the past driven
the technology, and it will continue to be a significant
consideration for the future. The high cost of expendable space
systems led to the development of the space shuttle by the United
States. However experience of the shuttle in use has not yet given
convincing proof that launch costs have been reduced. The major
lesson of the first three decades in space is that the costs of
breaking free from the Earth's gravity remain very high. The European
Ariane 5 programme was designed to produce a cheap mass launching
capability. Yet the first launch in June 1996 produced a &#163;500
million fireworks display (3). This was a salutary reminder of the
costs and risks that are still implicit in the utilisation of space.
It is therefore important that whatever is done in space is provided
at minimum weight, and the development of microprocessor technology
has been a major factor.</P>

<P>Research will continue into rocket propulsion, and vehicle design,
but a major breakthrough in reduction in launch costs from the
Earth's surface to orbit is unlikely. It has been suggested that
projectile launch systems (first postulated by Jules Verne in the
last century) may offer lower cost satellite launching systems. The
extra costs of hardening each very expensive satellite cannonball,
coupled with the costs of building the necessary launch gun, have yet
to be shown to be economic. Civil research into propulsion systems
for space is focused on the system to be used once free of the
earth's gravity. The five most promising techniques identified are:
nuclear-electric propulsion, solar-electric propulsion, laser
propulsion, solar sails, and electromagnetic ram accelerators. (4).
Until warfare is transferred from the Earth to other planets, these
researches are unlikely to be important to military systems.</P>

<P>Research has also been undertaken on the development of hybrid
aircraft/rockets which can use conventional aircraft techniques to
reach the upper atmosphere, from where they can launch into low earth
orbit. While these developments may improve the reliability of
reusable space vehicles, they are unlikely to change the payload
costs much. The highest that conventional aircraft operate is at
around 20 miles, and at this distance from the earth, the
gravitational potential is little less than at the surface.</P>

<P>If the costs of raising objects from ground level to orbit are to
remain high, the effectiveness of what is put into orbit is likely to
be a more productive area for research. The prospects of weapons,
both defensive and offensive, in space has at various times attracted
considerable interest; yet all man-made devices in space today are
either civil, military but non-offensive, or inert. Anti-satellite
weapons have been tested, and will be considered later in this
chapter. Other space-based weapon systems remain in the research
laboratory. Space today is home to a range of military satellites who
roles are reconnaissance, communications, navigation, meteorology,
and geodetic survey.</P>

<P>Reconnaissance satellites exploit a wide range of the
electromagnetic spectrum. Electronic intelligence can be gathered
from radio and radar signals. Early warning of missile launch is
gained from infra-red sensors observing the missile exhaust. The
visible and near visible region can provide traditional strategic and
tactical reconnaissance information. The areas for productive
research to improve military capability revolve around the normal
reconnaissance cycle. In this, the time between initiating the task
and receiving the processed information must be as short as possible,
the quality of the information must be as high as possible, and the
interpretation of the data must be as accurate as possible.</P>

<P>The propagation characteristics of particular wavelengths of
electromagnetic radiation in the atmosphere make satellite
reconnaissance less than totally reliable. They can only complement
an overall intelligence picture obtained from aircraft and human
sources. Nevertheless improvements in sensors will improve
sensitivity and discrimination. More active scanning may offer
improved results. Radar or laser emitters from the satellite could
illuminate specific targets. One particular area where successful
research could have a dramatic effect on military effectiveness is in
the detection of submarines under the ocean. Techniques being
explored include high-power lasers, magnetic anomaly detection, small
temperature anomaly detection, radar, and sea surface movement.(5)
After many years of research, none of these seem to offer the
prospect of making the oceans transparent, but they may aid submarine
detection.</P>

<P>Reducing the time taken for the reconnaissance cycle is also
amenable to novel techniques. While some satellites can be placed in
geosynchronous orbit to monitor a particular area, their great
distance from the surface reduces definition. If they are placed in
low orbit to improve quality, then they cannot hold position over one
area, and only a part of their orbit will be useful. This can be
compensated for by the use of a number of satellites which weave a
pattern of orbits to ensure the required level of coverage of the
target. This multiplies the cost. For particular operations it may be
worth launching a reconnaissance satellite into a predetermined orbit
for the one mission: an expensive option. While such satellites have
the ability to move orbit from their own power sources, such
provision is finite and once the fuel is exhausted they will soon
decay and burn up. It is possible to envisage drone satellites being
launched from a space station for particular missions, and recovered
at the end of the task for refuel. It is not obvious that the
benefits would outweigh the costs, unless the space station were
justified on other grounds.</P>

<P>The utility of a space station is something which is worth
examining separately. Many future projections of military use of
space start from the assumption that such a platform will be
available. By space station, it is generally assumed that this would
be a continuously manned orbiting structure, which allowed a range of
space tasks to be carried out, with regular replenishment from the
Earth. Without specifying the nature of the platform, costs are
inevitably speculative. Van Allen suggested a figure of $30 billion
(1984 dollars) for the NASA station which was then proposed for
1993.(6) The Soviet Union was at the forefront of research into
prolonged manned spaceflight, and operated rudimentary manned space
stations with docking facilities since Salyut 1 in 1971. The current
Russian space station Mir has been under construction since 1986. It
had an expected lifetime of 7 years, but at the end of that time only
4 of the 6 modules had been assembled in space. During its first 7
years in orbit, only 19 man-years of activity were accumulated.(7)
</P>

<P>A new international space station proposal is now underway (7a).
In 1996, the designers are confidently predicting completion in June
2002, a lifetime of 10 years, and a through life cost of over $100
billion. If it comes to fruition, and that on past experience is
doubtful, it will be entirely a non-military venture. The costs are
so great that it has to be an international venture, and this
precludes military activity.</P>

<P>The real question is whether the presence of men is of such vital
importance that it outweighs the cost of the associated support
systems. Whether systems are launched from Earth, or assembled in
orbit on a space station, they still require the same overall
expenditure of energy to put them into orbit. A space station
requires the additional energy costs of raising its own support
service elements into orbit. The costs benefits, as opposed to the
prestige benefits are not obvious, and the balance of cost advantage
between manned and unmanned space systems shows little sign of
changing in the future.</P>

<P>The second class of satellites to be considered are those used for
communications. Here military and civilian development has gone on in
parallel. Indeed to the man in the street, communication satellites
have been the prime area of progress through the exploitation of
space. Worldwide telephone, television and data transmission are now
ordinary aspects of modern life. Development work continues in order
to provide more powerful television relays from orbit to cover larger
areas of the world. In the military sphere, satellites have brought
into reality the ability to communicate securely over any distance
with total reliability. The vagaries of the ionosphere, which used to
make HF communications such a black art, have been replaced by a
worldwide communication capability as clear and dependable as
line-of-sight VHF radio.(8)</P>

<P>Such communications can transform military effectiveness, but also
carry penalties. The ease with which command and control can be
exercised from the highest to the lowest formation through satellite
based communications makes the military ever more dependent on them.
The old back-up methods of HF radio, landline, and runner become even
less reliable through lack of use. Yet in the future, satellite
communications could be a very productive area for offensive action.
The effect of EMP has already been discussed, and more selective
anti-satellite measures will be considered later. The disruption of
satellite communication links are an important part of any future
information warfare plan. Nevertheless, research in both civil and
military sectors will lead to more powerful satellite relay
facilities which will continue to reduce the size of the
communication equipment required on the ground.</P>

<P>Satellite navigation systems have been in operation since 1960.
The early systems were based on single satellites in well defined
orbits using Doppler frequency shift techniques. Two passes of the
satellite were required and the signal needed to be processed by
cumbersome ground equipment. Accuracies to within a metre were
obtainable within a few days of collecting data. This was of limited
utility, and in the mid 1970s the US Department of Defense began
development of a system designed to give three dimensional position
information, anywhere on the earth, instantaneously and to accuracies
of better than one metre. The principle to be used was relatively
simple: a number of satellites would send out ranging information,
and position would be established by a form of triangulation. Each
satellite would transmit a radio pulse at a known time. The receiving
unit would calculate how long the signal had taken to arrive and its
distance from each satellite. Using four satellites, it is no longer
necessary for the receiver to have a synchronised clock. Using a
technique developed by radio astronomers in the 1950s, it also proved
possible to transmit continuously from all satellites on the same
frequency. Pseudo-random sequences were used to encode and
differentiate the signals. This Global Positioning System (GPS) began
deployment in the early 1980s, and today has some 21 primary
satellites with three spares in orbit. (9)</P>

<P>The system of encoding GPS signals appeared to have another
advantage for military use. Selective availability could be
incorporated. Friendly military forces could use the data with full
accuracy and civilian (or potentially hostile forces) could be
provided with degraded accuracy. However, civilian scientists rapidly
showed how they could work around such selective availability and
achieve accuracies to within millimetres using the degraded signals.
GPS data has proved so useful to such a range of civilian activities
that commercial concerns now broadcast correction data which makes
achievement of GPS accuracies to within one centimetre easy to
obtain. In the Gulf War, the Allied forces were often issued with
civilian differential GPS as it was cheaper, more available and just
as accurate as the military encoded GPS units. Another military
technology had been exploited for civilian purposes and improved. The
Gulf War of 1992 was the first war in which land forces could know
their exact position at all times. It allowed co-ordination in a
quite new way. Future operations can assume that every individual
will know where he is and how to get to where he is going.</P>

<P>There are however significant dangers from universally available
GPS. Precise navigation of men or missiles becomes very cheap. Signal
degrading does not work, and in any case the Russian GLONASS system
provides an alternative method. As civil airlines become more
dependent on the system, it will become impossible to turn the system
off, and it will be given greater redundancy. Spoofing of the signals
will be an important area for research.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Satellites for meteorology and geodetic survey also have military
implications. They can provide data for strategic missiles, terrain
mapping data for cruise missiles, or tactical weather information for
the battlefield commander. The quantity of data which can be
obtained, when coupled to the increasingly powerful computers, offers
more accurate, detailed, and longer term forecasting. The
availability of either type of satellite in war is unlikely to be
critical.</P>

<P>Given the importance of satellites to military operations, it is
perhaps surprising that there has not been more investment in
anti-satellite (ASAT) warfare. As discussed above, the new
capabilities brought by satellite systems are making armed forces
increasingly dependent and hence vulnerable. A productive area for
research is to seek ways to destroy satellites. Such offensive
systems may be ground-based, air launched or space-based. ASAT may be
widespread in effect, localised or selective against particular
systems. Systems that have been looked include an ASAT missile
launched by a high flying aircraft (US), and a manoeuvrable exploding
satellite (USSR). Possible developments include the use of
appropriate frequency laser damage weapons to blind reconnaissance
systems. The exploding satellite could be developed into a space mine
system, or a missile could expel shrapnel to cause mechanical damage.
Should a manned space station be built, then selective ASAT weapons
could be used. Directed energy and kinetic energy kill mechanism
would both be useful techniques in space. The impetus for research
into ASAT systems has declined following the end of the Cold War.
Nevertheless, as the major powers become ever more dependent on their
space based systems, the potential threat posed by ASAT weapons needs
to be kept in mind.</P>

<P>The other part of the ASAT question is development of defensive
measures. This is a much more difficult problem. Blacking out sensors
under attack is one avenue. Mobility and offensive firepower on
otherwise passive satellites may be another. Indeed the future of
ASAT warfare begins to sound like the development of air warfare. Its
major difference is in the cost of such systems. It may be that
ultimately the only defence against pre-emptive satellite destruction
is to ensure that military forces do not become totally dependent on
the systems. Certainly the advantage of control of space is such that
it could be war winning. It appears therefore that ASAT research is a
major requirement for defence funding. Some place their hopes in arms
control negotiations outlawing such research or deployment. The
argument is that it is in the interests of both of the superpowers to
be able to have assured use of satellite system for strategic
reconnaissance and communication. The world is a safer place when
both know that the other can detect and react to a surprise attack;
and hence no such attack takes place. The fallacy in this argument is
that such a treaty is practically unenforceable. The technologies
have many applications and can be rapidly adapted for ASAT work.(10)
It is therefore important that both realise that the destruction of
one state's satellites by the other will earn retribution in kind.
This means that ASAT research is a vital area.</P>

<P>The use of weapons in space for the limited purpose of denying an
enemy the use of his satellite systems brings us to the wider
consideration of war in space. Since 1983, when President Reagan
first looked to scientists to provide protection against strategic
nuclear weapons, the possibility of defending against ballistic
missiles has kept war in space as a topical issue. The initial
research undertaken sought to provide a system which could destroy
nuclear ballistic missiles in flight. Research was directed towards
providing a layered system. In such a system, missiles would be
attacked during their initial launch period when the hot exhaust
gases of the rocket motor, and the relatively slower speeds, make
them easier targets. During this period response times must be very
short (the boost phase lasts only 2-5 minutes). Those that got
through this defence would then be attacked during the ballistic
mid-course period when the independent warheads separate from the
missile. Here there are problems with acquisition, decoys and kill
assessment. Finally those missiles penetrating the second layer would
have to be destroyed by a final defensive screen designed to destroy
warheads re-entering the atmosphere.</P>

<P>The strategic arguments over the utility of such a defensive
system were less than straightforward. (11). While the technical
arguments about kinetic energy and directed energy weapon feasibility
will take years to answer, all agree on the high cost of all systems
involved. Figures approaching $1000 billion are suggested as an order
of magnitude for deploying a space based defensive system. The system
must have target surveillance and acquisition systems, discrimination
against decoys, pointing and tracking systems, kill assessment
capability, appropriate weapons, and an overall command and control
arrangement. All of these require new developments in technology, and
can ultimately only provide a limited defence against nuclear
weapons. Assuming the highly unlikely possibility that a space-based
defensive system worked first time (no real test would ever be
possible) and eliminated most ballistic missiles, that would still
leave the prospect of nuclear attack by cruise missiles, aircraft and
man-carried systems.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The end of the Cold War has reduced the impetus to produce a
comprehensive space-based defensive system, and research into SDI
continues at a much lower, and more appropriate level. The use of
Scud mobile short range conventional surface to surface missiles
during the Gulf War of 1992 generated urgent interest in theatre
missile defensive systems. It was clear that ten year's of spending
on the vastly expensive SDI project had produced nothing of use
against this problem. Nor is it likely that future theatre missile
defences will be space-based.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Given that nations may nevertheless continue development of
space-based defensive systems, some research to counter the systems
will remain important. Fortunately the counter systems are by and
large both cheaper and less complex. Defence against directed energy
weapons through materials technology will pay dividends. The
reduction of boost phase time for missiles, and the improvement of
decoy systems will also prove fruitful. However the solution to a
partially capable missile defence system may be simply to increase
the number of offensive missiles. While this does little to help arms
control and disarmament, it may be an appealing answer to states in
the future.</P>

<P>Moving from defensive to offensive weapons in space, the field is
wide open. It is argued that some of the SDI technologies could have
offensive possibilities. In the past schemes for orbiting nuclear
weapons were considered. Fortunately common-sense has prevailed.
While they might offer slightly shorter response times to anywhere on
the planet, they would be destabilising and also potentially
hazardous both on launch and recovery. The exotic directed energy
weapons designed for counter-missile use might have applications
against aircraft or cruise missiles. The atmosphere provides
considerable protection, and the countermeasures could do much to
reduce effectiveness. Conventional missiles could be fired from
space-based launchers; but the energy bill to put them in orbit must
still be paid, and the advantages are difficult to see.</P>

<P>One kinetic energy system which is under development is the
electromagnetic rail gun. In this a small projectile is accelerated
to speeds of 5-25 km/sec. The power requirements for such a system
are likely to be prohibitive, but it is possible to envisage it
having a greater application than just anti-missile operations in
space. If the acceleration takes place from orbit, then speed
reduction when fired into the atmosphere will be minimal. The problem
then becomes one of burn-up. As a system against high flying aircraft
it may have application, but again at a cost which is likely to be
prohibitive.</P>

<P>Nowhere more than in space technology does the excitement and
glamour of research over-ride the mundane considerations of military
cost effectiveness. The history of the space age carries all the
necessary warnings: progress has been slow and costly. Following the
US Space Shuttle disaster, and a series of unmanned launcher
failures, the US has found it difficult even to keep up with its
routine satellite launch requirements. The Ariane 5 explosion of 1996
showed that cheap and predictable launch systems are still some way
away. Grandiose schemes in space all have to answer the question of
the energy costs in placing a given mass into orbit. High power
weapons call for higher energy cost. In only one area does it appear
that research and development could have significant security
implications; and that is ASAT. The ability to destroy, disable or
disrupt satellites may become a crucial factor. Suitable defensive
measures will need to be developed.</P>
