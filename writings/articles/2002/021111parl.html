		<h3><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">New Threats, Old Problems</font></h3>
		<h4><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The threats may be new but the old problem of lack of capability continues to haunt NATO</font></h4>
		<h4><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">by Tim Garden</font></h4>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">NATO is one of the great success stories of the past half century. In parallel with the EU, it has made Europe stable and safe. Yet as it approaches a major summit in Prague, the outlook is uncertain. NATO coped well with the changes at the end of the Cold War, and carved out a useful niche in the difficult task of stabilising the Balkans. <br>
				<br>
				The attacks of 11 September 2001 on Washington and New York have posed new questions over the relevance of the Alliance. Terrorism has not in the past been solved by purely military means. Yet NATO moved immediately to invoke its first ever declaration under Article 5 of its founding treaty. But Washington was slow to take up the offer of help. Experience during the Kosovo crisis of inadequate European forces, coupled with frustration at the need to achieve consensus among the other 18 members, has coloured American views. <br>
				<br>
				In 2001, NATO sent its airborne early warning force to help defend American airspace while the real  battle moved to Afghanistan. A number of European nations have played a significant role in Afghanistan through bilateral arrangements with the USA. Nowhere is there a NATO flag to be seen. Few who study  Alliance arrangements are surprised, and some would say that Kosovo will prove to be NATO's first and last war unless the Europeans provide some useful military capabilities..<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				The agenda for Prague is daunting, and enlargement has become almost the easiest topic. <br>
				At the last major summit in  Washington in 1999, members signed up to a daunting list of promises to improve their military capabilities under the rubric of the Defence Capabilities Initiative (DCI). Some 58 weaknessess were to be corrected. Unsurprisingly, little was done subsequently. The Europeans continued to spend their budgets on every public service except defence. There are some signs that recent moves in France and the UK may give a lead to arrest the decline in funding. But nowhere in Europe is there any prospect of the massive increases necessary to match the USA. <br>
				<br>
				<br>
				In Prague, they will focus on a few key capabilities in the DCI shopping list. The most urgent of these are seen by NATO to be ensuring command, communication and information superiority, improving interoperability of deployed forces and key aspects of combat effectiveness, ensuring rapid deployment and sustainment of forces, and defences against attacks by chemical biological or nuclear weapons. But the USA has moved on. It is  now spending well over twice as much on defence as all of the Europeans put together, and is using the money to transform the way it fights.  One proposal to be discussed will look to establish a high-tech high-readiness force that can plug into American military systems instantly. This NATO Response Force will be designed to give European members an inside track to the new American ways of fighting.<br>
				<br>
				The realist does not expect NATO to succeed in transforming European armed forces at Prague . The EU is having equal difficulties with its own plans for improving military effectiveness. Until Europeans are prepared to trust each other more in the defence field, they will continue to waste their scarce resources duplicating national military structures. The logic is for much deeper integration of military capabilities in order to be able to afford the new technologies. Europe could field its own strategic air and maritime deployment capability, its own intelligence and reconnaissance system, its own precision attack capability, or its own air to air refueling force. This will require new arrangements for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. Perhaps the EU Convention will prove ultimately more important than Prague for the future of NATO.</font></p>
