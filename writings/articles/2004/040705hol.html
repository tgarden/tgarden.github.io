			<h3>Civil Contingencies Bill &#150; 5 July 2004</h3>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>My Lords, I welcome this long awaited Bill. It seems extraordinary that we are now nearly 3 years on from the terrible terrorist attacks on Washington and New York and the subsequent major outrages by militant Islamic extremist organisations around the globe. Yet we have not yet put a duty on our local government organisations to plan and prepare responses to such major catastrophic events. </p>
			<p>Sir David Omand, speaking last week at the Royal United Services Institute, said that the achievable strategic aim for the next 5 years was to deny the terrorist the ability to disrupt our way of life, our prosperity and our confidence in our own societies and culture. This Bill fits with that aim.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;The need for this legislation is urgent. The Defence Select Committee called for urgent action to produce the Bill in its 6<sup>th</sup> report of July 2002. It said then:</p>
			<address><b> &quot;</b>Ten months have now passed since the terrible attacks of 11 September and nearly a year since the publication of the emergency planning review document. We believe that the Government has had time enough to address the issues raised by the review. It should now as a matter of urgency publish its proposals for civil contingencies legislation, with the explicit aim of introducing that legislation in the 2002-03 parliamentary session.&quot;</address>
			<p>Reporting a year later in its 7<sup>th</sup> report of July 2003, they regretted the continuing delays and called for a greater sense of urgency. I share with the Committee a sense of bewilderment at the slow progress on this enabling bill. Through a combination of good luck and hard work by our intelligence and police services, we have not suffered an attack like that in Madrid in March. If we had had to cope with a similar scale of attack, we might have wished that we had made more progress with tasking arrangements for civil protection.</p>
			<p>I shall concentrate my remarks on aspects of Part 1 of the Bill. Through the Cold War, we invested considerable resources in all aspects of civil defence. Rightly these were scaled down, but now we need to recreate the expertise and capability to cope with short-notice high-impact events. A rapid response can reduce casualties significantly. To achieve rapid response, those tasked need effective planning, regular training, and the right equipment.</p>
			<p>The Bill in placing a duty of contingency planning on local authorities and emergency services requires them to conduct a whole range of activities such as: emergency planning, risk assessment, business continuity planning, and communications to public and businesses. If these plans are to work on the day, they will require significant training and exercises. Of course local authorities already carry out some emergency simulations.</p>
			<p>For example, in 2003 Derbyshire County Council Emergency Planning Team carried out 25 exercises, four of these were practical exercises while the rest were &lsquo;table top&rsquo; scenarios.&nbsp; The exercises included people from the health services, emergency services, local authority staff, the voluntary sector, the utilities and local media.&nbsp; Over 500 people were involved in emergency planning exercises in 2003 and scenarios covered city centre explosions and evacuation, major chemical incidents, health scenarios (epidemics, vaccinations etc.) and transport accidents.&nbsp; However, to date no exercises on responses to terrorism have been carried out.&nbsp; The public have not been involved in the exercises other than when leaflet drops have taken place.</p>
			<p>The bill will require each authority to do more, and for that they need extra resources. unlike the emergency services, local authorities have received no extra funding to undertake additional anti-terrorism work expected of them by the Government.&nbsp; Furthermore the emergency planning service is already severely under funded. It is not good enough for the government to put new tasks without accompanying resources. This is not an area where we can afford to take risks through under funding.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;I wish to raise one other aspect of our preparations which is of concern to me. Both the Joint Committee and the Defence Select Committee in their reports on the Bill expressed concern that the responsibilities of Central Government were not covered by the Bill. The Government answered these concerns in January 2004 in Cm 6078 by explaining that Ministers are directly accountable to Parliament. This does not seem to me to be a good enough excuse in these very special circumstances.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;The role of the MOD in preparing for its part in coping with terrorist attacks has not been encouraging. The 2003 Defence White Paper gives a list of the measures taken. The major innovation of the Civil Contingency Reaction Force (CCRF) was reported then as being at only 75% of planned strength with uneven geographical distribution. I should be grateful if the Minister could provide the latest update, but perhaps more importantly what number of CCRF personnel are expected to be available within 4 hours of any major emergency.</p>
			<p>The armed forces have shown that they provide an essential capability for civil contingencies. When there is reasonable notice like the fire officers strike, then large numbers can be brought in. When administrative chaos ensues, like foot and mouth, the army can bring structure and order, and when floods threaten, specialist military equipment saves lives. Yet all of these events give time for the normal Military Aid to the Civil Power arrangements to click in. With our forces overtasked and deployed globally, we may be less fortunate following a CBRN terror attack.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;The Defence Select Committee reported last week that the MOD presumption is that homeland security will be undertaken by whatever is not being used for other tasks. They concluded &quot;We are not convinced that an essentially reactive approach to the defence of the UK homeland is satisfactory given the nature of the threat to the UK.&quot; &nbsp;I agree.</p>
			<p>If we could afford the panoply of quick reaction forces and civil defence available to defend the UK during the Cold War, then we need to task the MOD to look at what it could do to assist the hard pressed local authorities who are being tasked in this Bill. Without a clear statement of what is available from Central Government, we are likely to see sub-optimal planning, exercises and procurement.</p>
