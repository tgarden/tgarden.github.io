<P><CENTER><B>Chatham House 15 May 1998</B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER></P>

<P>At this stage of the conference, I have been asked to speak not as
the Director of Chatham House, but in my capacity as a former
military officer. Inevitably we have spent much of the time
discussing the arcane world of procurement and the defence industry.
In this relationship the PE is often referred to as the customer. In
fact the customer is the soldier, sailor and airman on the frontline.
Not the frontline today usually, but the frontline of 5, 10, 15 or 20
years hence. We spend our time trying to applying the lessons of the
last bit of combat (perhaps 5 or 10 years ago) to our guess at the
needs of combat in these future distant times. Of course the combat
that we find ourselves undertaking is also shaped by what
capabilities we have. We hope that politicians will be careful enough
not to pick a fight where we cannot win.</P>

<P>So for this session, I would like to put down a few cautionary
markers from the military perspective. Many of you will know that I
spent about a third of my military career in the MOD, and some of
that in the Programmes area. You will not therefore be surprised that
I take a fairly sceptical view of the claims of research scientists,
industry and the single services when it comes to assertions of
ultimate capabilities. Every equipment decision involves trade offs.
Resources are finite and demands tend to the infinite. The
specialist, whether a seaman, a soldier or an airman, or within that
a tank man, a gunner, an air defender, a submariner, will have a
hundred reasons why the latest technological development in his area
is the most important need for the future. Industry will agree, so
long as the solution is one which they produce, and national industry
will use the political pressure that can be attached to supporting
the defence industrial base.</P>

<P>In a rational procurement process, reasonable folk would agree the
military task and decide whether it was adequately catered for, could
be dealt with through an evolutionary upgrade of existing systems,
could be provided off the shelf in a less than perfect, but still
adequate way, or required a new system. The new system should not be
presupposed to be land, sea or air. Again from the purely military
value for money aspect, the nationality of the supplier (with obvious
security of supply considerations) should not be a factor. However,
we live in the real world, which is messier and more political. A
project which has direct employment benefits, and the possibility of
further benefits through exports, will rightly be more attractive to
a government, than one which may provide maximum military capability
but no parallel economic benefits. This however is the input for the
politician to make. It seems to me that the military planner has the
responsibility to make the rational military argument.</P>

<P>That is of course becoming ever more difficult. In the Cold War
one could call upon the Defence Intelligence Services to provide
detailed threat analysis, orders of battle, and enemy doctrine. The
OA community could model proposed counter systems and produce best
buys. I am not in any way suggesting that any of this process was
reliable, but it was at least possible. Today we are in an
extraordinary situation. There is only one real military power: the
United States. We plan on the assumption that for any major action we
shall be fighting as part of a coalition with the United States. We
struggle to look for scenarios in which the US is not a player, but
some of Europe is. All this may be wrong. NATO might disappear into a
talking shop at some time in the future &ntilde; but we are not
assuming that. China might become a new superpower in time, but we
are not assuming that. Where else? We can see the possibility of
major conflict again in the Middle East, the Gulf, the Indian
sub-continent, Taiwan, and Korea; and continuing misery in Africa
(North and Centre, and perhaps even Southern), perhaps Indonesia,
perhaps the Balkans,maybe Cyprus, parts of Russia, the Central Asian
republics, Afghanistan.. We see the rise of international crime and
corruption as being a greater threat to emerging democracies than
military adventures. But none of these scenarios seem to argue for
the need of an alternative to the US led option.</P>

<P>The Strategic Defence Review in the UK has tried to address these
difficulties. The new Strategic Concept for NATO is trying to do the
same for the Alliance. For the UK, it seems clear that the policy is
a continuation of the assumption that for high intensity warfare, we
will be operating with the US. This is a realistic approach but has a
number of dangers for the defence planner and perhaps also for the UK
and European defence industries. The US is developing a high
technology based military system which will require system
interoperability at a much deeper level than just IFF, radio channels
and refueling systems. The UK/US special relationship is often quoted
as very major military benefit &ntilde; and so it is. But it is not
cost free. To access US systems already requires significant
resources to be spent on data link and information processing
systems. Such systems then become barriers to cooperation with other
European allies. But this is at the moment in relatively few
specialist areas.</P>

<P>Looking forward to the military of Joint Vision 2010, (and
assuming it takes longer and may be different again), every aspect of
military operations will need to be able to plug into the US
architecture. For some years it will still be possible to operate in
a group of US led forces, but the technological have nots will be
pushed ever further from the action. They will be there to give
legitimacy, but not much else. The worry that is often expressed is
of the European forces becoming the cannon fodder for the US high
tech stand off capability. I do not think this is the risk. Far more
likely is that the low capability forces will be seen as an
impediment to operations and will be kept out of the firing line. We
have already seen examples of this from the Gulf War.</P>

<P>This leaves nations with difficult choices. If they pursue the US
vision, they will find themselves dependent on US technology and
doubtless US industry. They may end up with military capability which
can be used only when the US is there, but is of marginal importance
(apart from political significance) in a US dominated force. In
defence industrial terms this seems to suggest advantages in
developing yet more transatlantic cooperation. At the same time, if
european governments find that their military capability is of little
real national significance, and is not helping the domestic economy,
and is more for showing political solidarity, there will be little
reason for maintaining expenditure at any given level. Provided that
a token capability can be deployed, the US will pick up the real
force requirements. If the US is unwilling to provide the lead, there
will be a decreasing ability to operate in any other grouping (such
as an EU force) given the resources that have been consumed in
following the high tech option.</P>

<P>What do I suggest as a way through these uncertainties? I suppose
I come down to a few axioms:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><ADDRESS>If you want to keep public and political support
for defence expenditure, you need to keep a usable military
capability. The size of it is up for debate, but it needs to give
Ministers realistic options when there a security problem arises.
This will mean that you need to be able to deploy the forces
necessary in a reasonable timescale. They need to be equipped with
defensive and offensive capability which gives them a high ( I was
going to say reasonable &ntilde; but I think the need for assurance
of success is on the rise) chance of success.</ADDRESS></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><ADDRESS>Provision of Defence must transparently make a
contribution to the economy of the country. That means that national
defence industries (or european if merged) must be supported even if
it means not necessarily buying the self evidently best value for
money.</ADDRESS></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><ADDRESS>Capabilites must not be scenario-dependent. This
should always have been a guiding light from experience in the past.
Most aircraft I flew were being used in ways that were not foreseen
when they were procured. The Vulcan was procured as a high level
strategic nuclear bomber, but spent most of its life in the low level
nuclear role. It&iacute;s only combat was seen as a medium level
conventional bomber in the Falklands war and it ended up as an
air-to-air refueling tanker. There are countless examples of adapting
military equipment to new tasks not foreseen during the design phase.
Given the uncertainties of the future, this need for flexibility will
be even more important. The most flexible component of any military
system remains the man. Keeping the man in the loop seems to me of
ever greater importance. The pressures for moving the man further
away from the action will increase both for costs and casualty
reasons. Yet the man remains the way to adapt the system to the
unexpected.</ADDRESS></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><ADDRESS>Finally, the balance of advantage of new
technology systems against evolutionary upgrading of current systems
needs to be addressed seriously. The battle over funding for
Eurofighter in the national capitals should be a warning of the
difficulties ahead for any high cost (even if good value) project.
Already lifetimes of systems are spanning half a century &ntilde; our
military contribution to the Great lakes was a Canberra. Yet
technology seems to accelerate faster than Moores Law. Sometimes, the
new capabilities also introduce new vulnerabilities.</ADDRESS>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I suppose in sum, I am saying that the pragmatic mix of upgrades,
new systems and off the shelf procurement that the UK is doing, seems
appropriate for the uncertain world we find ourselves in today.</P>
