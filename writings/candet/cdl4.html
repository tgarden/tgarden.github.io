<H2><CENTER>BRITISH NUCLEAR STRATEGY</CENTER></H2>

<P>Scientific research in Britain, and in particular the work of the
Maud Committee in 1940 and 1941, had demonstrated the feasibility of
the uranium isotope, U235 atomic bomb, and the possibility of the
plutonium bomb. The report gave an added impetus to research in the
United States and a fully collaborative venture was in being by 1943.
Britain was, therefore, totally involved in the original development
of atomic weapons. There was a natural assumption that, as a great
power and victor of the war, Britain would continue to take a leading
role in atomic energy research and development after 1945.</P>

<P>The new Labour government was only a week old when the Hiroshima
bomb was dropped on 6 August 1945. Margaret Gowing has written a
comprehensive exposition of the decision-making processes which led
to the British atomic bomb.l Although no decision to produce an
atomic bomb was taken initially, the Cabinet sub-committee, GEN 75,
set up a research establishment at Harwell tasked with investigating
all aspects of atomic energy. It soon became clear that the Americans
had no intention of sharing the fruits of their own atomic research,
and in August 1946, the McMahon Act made the exchange of all such
information illegal.</P>

<P>Although there was no political decision to produce atomic
weapons, the military were convinced of the need to have an atomic
capability to match any other power which might develop such weapons.
At the end of 1945, the Chiefs of Staff were pressing for two atomic
piles to be built, as they would need as many atomic bombs as
possible.2 In August 1946, the Chief of the Air Staff put in a demand
through normal procurement channels for an atomic bomb.3 The
political decision to proceed was taken in January 1947. The bomb was
developed quite independently of the United States, and successfully
tested on 3 October 1952. It was assumed that the build up of nuclear
stockpiles in America and Russia would be comparatively slow, and
that the British force would therefore be of major significance in
deterring the use of Soviet bombs against the British isles.4</P>

<H4>INCREASING RELIANCE ON THE NUCLEAR THREAT</H4>

<P>The 1952 Chiefs of Staff Global Strategy Paper argued that more
reliance should be placed on nuclear threats to contain Soviet
expansion.5 The nuclear arsenal was seen as the counter to the Soviet
conventional force superiority. It was not until 1956 that Britain
had a significant operational nuclear capability with the coming into
service of the V-bomber force. The dependence on the effectiveness of
this force was such that the following year, the Defence White Paper
stated that large conventional forces would no longer be necessary.6
The 800,000 men in the armed forces in 1956 were to be reduced to
375000 by 1962. The 1958 Defence White Paper made it clear that the
nuclear deterrent forces were the mainstay of defence:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>In fact, the strategy of NATO is based
on the frank recognition that a full-scale Soviet attack could not be
repelled without resort to a massive nuclear bombardment of the
sources of power in Russia.' 7</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>There was a complete reliance on a massive retaliation strategy as
a response to Soviet aggression; and Britain was the first country to
base its national defence upon a declared policy of nuclear
deterrence.8 The potential vulnerability of the aircraft delivery
system, even with the stand-off Blue Steel glide bomb, was
recognised. A ballistic missile, Blue Streak, was therefore to be
developed. It was cancelled in 1960, when it was appreciated that the
likely cost of &#163;600 million would eventually provide an obsolete
system, which, because of liquid fuelling and soft launchers, would
be vulnerable to surprise attack. America was prepared to supply an
air launched ballistic missile system, Skybolt, which was under
development and could be used by the V-bombers. On 7 November 1962,
the United States announced the cancellation of the Skybolt
programme. Technical problems and the vulnerability of aircraft-based
systems made the Minuteman and Polaris much more attractive prospects
to them. Prime Minister Macmillan salvaged the situation by obtaining
an extremely advantageous agreement from President Kennedy, at Nassau
in December 1962, for the supply of Polaris to Britain. An American
technical and economic decision was therefore responsible for the
radical change in the basis of the British deterrent: Polaris could
have been opted for in 1960 if it had been preferred to Skybolt.9
</P>

<H4>THE CONTRIBUTION TO NATO</H4>

<P>The Nassau agreement formalised the assignment of the British
nuclear forces to NATO, and brought them into the American nuclear
targeting plan. Macmillan insisted on preserving the option for
independent use in the supreme national interest. This independence
clause may have been predominantly to preserve Britain's great power
role; but France was already expressing concern over the credibility
of the American nuclear support for Europe, and this may have been a
factor. In 1964, the Defence White Paper did consider the possibility
of a 'mistaken' Soviet belief in the unwillingness of America to
defend Europe, and hence the need for a European nuclear power. 10
</P>

<P>The Labour government of 1964 played down the independent aspect
of Britain's nuclear forces. The 1965 Defence Estimates centred on
the contribution to NATO and the proposed, but never to be formed,
Atlantic Nuclear Force. The only reference to possible independent
use was in relation to the Chinese atomic test, and the ability of
the British nuclear force to provide some reassurance to non-nuclear
powers. 11 The lack of direction in British nuclear strategy was
expressed in an Editorial of the Royal United Services Institute
Journal in 1966, to mark the launching of HMS Resolution, the first
of the Polaris submarines:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>The political background to Polaris has
been more troubled than the background to what one might call the
purely hardware side, mainly because there is no authoritative
statement of what the British Polaris fleet is expected to achieve. l

<P>The emergence of the doctrine of flexible response in the United
States in the early 1960s was not greeted with great enthusiasm by
Britain. A strategy which called for more conventional forces and
greater manpower was not economically attractive. When the doctrine
was adopted as official NATO policy in 1967, the British Army was
some 191,000 strong; virtually half its size ten years before. The
size has not subsequently increased, and therefore Britain uses fewer
conventional forces when following a strategy of graduated response
than when it adhered to a massive retaliation policy.</P>

<H4>THE SECOND DECISION CENTRE</H4>

<P>The unwillingness of Britain and the other European NATO countries
greatly to enhance their conventional capabilities meant that,
notwithstanding flexible response, the American strategic nuclear
guarantee remained the basis of the security of Western Europe. Yet
as North America became more and more vulnerable to the Soviet
strategic arsenal, this guarantee became less credible. In this
dilemma, the British deterrent had a new role to play. Defence
Minister, Denis Healey has been credited with first postulating the
'second centre for decision making strategy in 1964.13 Through the
1970s, this concept was used in official statements about nuclear
forces, and in the 1980 Open Government Document discussing the
choice of the Polaris replacement, it was the major consideration:
<I>If Britain is to meet effectively the deterrent purpose of
providing a second centre of decision-making within the alliance, our
force has to be visibly capable of posing a massive threat on its
own.</I> 14</P>

<P>The philosophy of this doctrine was explained by the Defence
Minister, Francis Pym, as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>The decision to use nuclear weapons
would be an agonising one for any national leadership and the Soviets
must know this; but to have to calculate whether either of two powers
would be prepared to do so if pressed to the extremity, doubles their
uncertainty, complicates their planning and increases their risks. It
is in this way that our strategic and theatre nuclear forces
contribute so much to the collective deterrence of the Alliance.15
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>FUTURE TRENDS</H4>

<P>The decision to replace the Polaris fleet with Trident, combined
with NATO Theatre Nuclear Forces modernisation proposals, resulted in
considerable public debate in Britain over nuclear strategy. The
Labour party, in opposition, adopted the unilateral nuclear
disarmament of Britain as policy at its 1980 conference, and stated
in its 1983 election manifesto:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>Labour's commitment is to establish a
non-nuclear defence policy for this country. This means the rejection
of any fresh nuclear bases or weapons on British soil or in British
waters, and the removal of all existing nuclear bases and weapons,
thus enabling us to make a direct contribution to an eventually much
wider nuclear-free zone in Europe.16 </I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Another rationale for the independent nuclear force is in the
process of emerging. The replacement for Polaris will be - operating
well into the next century, by which time there may be many new
lesser nuclear weapon states, and old alliances may have changed
radically. In this unknown future, Defence Minister John Nott argued
that Britain must have its own invulnerable deterrent force, to
secure the country against any nuclear threat.17 The British
electorate appeared to support this view, and returned the
Conservative Government.</P>
