<H3><CENTER>Asian Security Worries</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER>by Sir Timothy Garden</CENTER></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>All of a sudden East Timor has snatched the headlines from Kosovo.
The United Nations seems to have been emboldened by the success of
the NATO operation in Kosovo, and has authorised the use of force by
its somewhat undersized intervention force. East Timor is a good
example for the international community to move forward its
humanitarian intervention agenda. There is little scope for spill
over into wider problems, and the people of the region have just been
given the opportunity to show in a referendum what they think of
their Indonesian oppressors. The UN has not done well in the past
over the East Timor problem, but appears to be prepared to show a
little more backbone this time.</P>

<P>There are are however other more globally serious potential
problems in Asia. The three regular Asian security issues, which
bubble up from time to time, seem set to reach the boil together.
Taiwan, North Korea and Kashmir are all in the news with sporadic,
but perhaps increasing, confrontation between their main players.
Each of the potential conflicts has a nuclear dimension which makes
for added concern. </P>

<P>Taiwan seems to have suddenly fallen out of favour with the Gods.
The  ongoing dispute on the meaning of "one country, two systems" has
flared up again this summer. China has reacted badly to the moves
that Taiwan has made towards more declaratory separateness. There
have been calls by the mainland military to settle the Taiwan problem
once and for all. The United States has been moving backwards in its
statements of support for Taiwan, which has given new strength to the
Chinese. There are still some factors which are to Taiwan's benefit.
An invasion across the straits would be very difficult, and an air
campaign by missiles and aircraft would polarise the international
community in a way which could be very unhelpful to China.
Economically, China is even more dependent on investment from Taiwan
after the Asian markets crisis. Nevertheless, the indications are
that the tension is higher across the Taiwan straits than it has been
for a long time. To add to its troubles, Taiwan has suffered the
worst earthquake this century. It may be that Taiwan will need to
direct its efforts to rebuilding the devastated territory, and that
China will feel less need to put down its rebellious island. On the
other hand, the military might see this as a particularly good time
to strike, when Taiwan is much weakened.</P>

<P> North Korea has played a relatively clever game in extracting
assistance from the rest of the world against its  threat to go
nuclear. It is not clear that the co-operative approaches have done
much to slow up its programme of development of weapons of mass
destruction. The test firing of a missile, literally over the heads
of the Japanese last year, indicated that North Korea is ready  to 
frighten its neighbours, despite  the dismal state of its economy.
That this year's new test has been postponed is unlikely to be a
change of long term  strategy. The  border between the two Koreas
remains  as dangerous a nuclear hair trigger as the Inner German
Border was during the Cold War. With the United States commitment to
South Korea, and China's interest in the region, there is also a
further nuclear dimension. </P>

<P>The third of the Asian hot frontiers is between India and
Pakistan. The two states have been nuclear weapon states for many
years. India tested a "peaceful nuclear explosion" 25 years ago.
However, the overt nuclear weapon tests of last year by both States
indicated that they wished to wave their nuclear status at each
other, and, in India's  case, at the international community. There
could be no logic to a nuclear war between the two countries.
Pakistan is an irritation to India, but cannot be a serious enough
competitor for India to risk the nuclear devastation of its major
population and industrial centres. Pakistan has no hope of beating
India, and would suffer a crippling blow in any full scale conflict
with India. In many ways the nuclear capability has the effect of
deterring either party from raising the stakes too high. Classic
deterrence theory should operate and prevent a conflict from
escalating. The one problem is the lack of safety mechanisms to
ensure political control of the nuclear weapons, when conflict over
Kashmir flares up.The international community needs to assist in
providing the necessary technologies to make the command and control
of both nuclear forces more reliable.</P>

<P>If we add the difficulties in Indonesia, which extend beyond the
current East Timor problem, Asia is an area which needs the attention
of the international community. China remains a key factor, and it is
by no means clear that the West has a coherent policy approach in its
dealing with China. The Asian markets crisis was a financial
earthquake which still has security aftershocks reverberating. The
recent rise in the markets has slowed down the reform measures in
many places, including Japan. If the world markets were to suffer a
large correction, Asia might tumble further and faster. We could see
instability in many parts of Asia as a result. </P>

<P>The UK government has not distinguished itself in making its
approach to the region clear. The arms to Indonesia chaos has made
the ethical dimension to foreign policy seem very threadbare.
Anti-democratic activities in Malaysia,  imprisonment of British
citizens in Burma and human rights abuses in China might be expected
to feature higher in an ethical agenda. Where would we stand on an
attack on Taiwan? It is a democracy which invests heavily in the UK.
Why is it unthinkable to sell fighters to Taiwan for defence, when we
can sell them to Indonesia? As always the answer, as it was for Hong
Kong, is China.</P>
