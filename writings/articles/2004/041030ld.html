			<h3>Events of the past 3 years</h3>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The return of Osama bin Laden to our screens last night, is an important reminder of how the world has changed over the past 3 years.</p>
			<p>On 11 September 2001, all our worlds changed. Western societies are extremely vulnerable to such tactics. We depend on a technological infrastructure to support our way of life.</p>
			<p>The universal&nbsp; European reaction to those attacks was one of sympathy for America and horror at the outrage. In France, Le Monde led with the headline that&nbsp; &quot;we are all Americans now&quot;. The bickering across the Atlantic was quieted. NATO invoked Article V (an attack on one is an attack on all) for the first time in its history on 12 September 2001. The world waited to see how the US would respond. Al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden achieved worldwide coverage. Not always negative in some parts of the world, it should be said.</p>
			<p>The US response was appropriate as seen from Europe. Al-Qaeda had trained thousands of its followers in camps in Afghanistan, and the Taliban rulers of that country had supported and been supported by bin Laden. It was understandable perhaps that President Bush wanted&nbsp; the retribution in Afghanistan to be a US rather than NATO operation. However,&nbsp; there has been a price to pay for not using the Alliance when it was ready and willing.</p>
			<p>And after al-Qaeda had been largely routed and the Taliban displaced, there was the challenge of rebuilding Afghanistan into a modern functioning democracy.&nbsp; The approach was sound and had universal support. A UN authorised constitutional process gave a clear path to producing a representative democracy. Hamad Karzai asked for assistance from the world to provide security in his war torn country, full of different ethnic groups, warlords and criminals. He said he needed an international force of 50,000 to provide the rule of law throughout the country.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>NATO eventually took on the stabilising role, but with not enough troops. The US continued warfighting &#150; as it does to this day in Afghanistan, while the Europeans picked up the peacekeeping side of the equation. So in Afghanistan, we had the right response to the 9/11 terror attacks, but have lacked the will to support the political process that could have made Afghanistan a more stable region. Instead, the opium crop is flourishing, the Taliban are reasserting themselves, and al-Qaeda operates more freely across the border with Pakistan. Despite the relatively successful electoral process, Afghanistan remains a violent and lawless country.</p>
			<p>With the Taliban gone, the US and Europe diverged in their approach to the new terror threat. The extraordinary energy and resources that went into all aspects&nbsp; of US Homeland Security is understood in Europe, but has not been followed. It may be that Europe is more complacent or stoic, or just less frightened. Guantanamo Bay is rightly seen as a counterproductive over-reaction, and our own Belmarsh approach has unfortunate echoes of this US policy. The European Union has done some really effective co-operation in border control, sharing of intelligence, and co-operation in bringing terrorists to justice. Where the big difference has come is in the perceptions on how to deal with the new security challenges. Indeed at a meeting last month, the new EU Counter-terrorism director when asked what Europe could do to reduce the threat said: the most important thing is to ratify the constitution&nbsp; as quickly as possible.</p>
			<p>The &quot;war on terror&quot; has not been a phrase with much resonance in Europe. All our previous experience in counter-terrorism has made us wary of adopting simple offensive strategies. President Bush's axis of evil speech, naming Iraq, Iran and North Korea, followed later in 2002 by the new US national security strategy left us worried by the new direction that the world's only superpower was taking. Pre-emption of emerging threats, as postulated in the new US strategy, seemed to be calling into question the whole international system.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>And then Iraq. I will not rehearse all the arguments over the military operation in Iraq in March 2003. We Liberal Democrats had an approach that we knew was right at the time, and has been resoundingly confirmed by subsequent events. Even after the military intervention, now recognised by Kofi Annan as illegal, we were clear that the post conflict rebuilding had to be internationalised. Yet the Pentagon kept an iron grip through the CPA, which led to mistake after mistake. Iraq is the extreme problem today because of the incompetence of the occupying authority for the year that it mismanaged the country.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Getting Iraq functioning as a normal country is the most important current challenge. It effects stability in the region and also the wider worries about deepening al-Qaeda support. We in the UK have a great responsibility to contribute to clearing up the mess which our government helped to make. However, we must insist that we have some say in the approach. Air strikes on Fallujah; civilian casualties whether they are 15,000 or 100,000 are bound to lead to greater violence and insurgency.&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>Future Paths</h3>
			<p>The diplomatic mess that Iraq caused has also damaged transatlantic and internal European relations at a time when we need to be working together on a series of difficult global security problems.</p>
			<p>As tempers cool, political leaders need to work at rebuilding the key international institutions. The UN has many tasks, and has survived previous spats. It will have to become more deeply involved in Iraq, but security of UN personnel remains a problem. We cannot ignore Israel-Palestine, North Korea, and many other nascent problems particularly in Africa.The EU also has more to bind it together than just foreign and security policy. It has much work to do on its own programme of enlargement. Turkey really is an important issue for the way the world develops. Yet, we cannot put off for ever the development of a European coherent approach to international action. It was really good news when last December, EU members agreed a document which laid out a global security strategy.</p>
			<h3>Future of International Security</h3>
			<p><b>&nbsp;</b>At the heart of our transatlantic debate, is the still unanswered question of how best to meet the new security challenges. There is a fair degree of agreement between the US and Europe on the most important ones.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>We face problems of international crime; of corruption which undermines democracy; of poverty in much of the world; of declining natural resources be it fish, oil or water; of environmental damage of which global warming is the most acute; of population growths in poorly governed regions; and of disease returning and spreading through global travel.</p>
			<p>Some of these factors make conflict more likely, and all of them need concerted action by the global community. Europe remains less effective when trying to meet the challenges at the hard end of security. These challenges come from undemocratic states developing powerful new weapons, with which they hope to deter intervention by the international community. They also come from extremists who combine a willingness to die for their cause, with a wish to maximise the terror and destruction on their enemies. And, they come from the strife within weak countries, which can lead to mass refugees, who look for help from the rich nations of the world.&nbsp; The US could do more at the softer end of security. Neither approach on its own can make us safer.</p>
			<p>The list of challenges is long. Israel-Palestine is near the top. If Israel does withdraw from Gaza, (perhaps at a time when there is a leadership crisis among the Palestinians) we will have to find a way of providing help both in terms of the economy and of security. We must also continue to see a just outcome for the West Bank.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Iran is also going to rise up the agenda. The US and Israel are becoming more concerned about the signs that Iran is intending to become a nuclear weapon state. Pre-emptive action would have a very adverse effect on stability in the region. Nor can we be confident that Pakistan, already a nuclear weapon state, will remain stable. North Korea has probably made the transition, and handling the unpredictable regime remains a problem. Taiwan remains a potential flashpoint. The Russian approach to their Chechen problem is unlikely to produce greater stability.</p>
			<p>Africa continues to provide a succession of disasters: some natural, some manmade. As the rich powerful region of the world, we have a responsibility to provide help; but real help, not imperial imposition of our solutions. The example of the EU small force that was deployed at very short notice to the Congo, to stabilise the situation until the UN could respond is perhaps the way ahead.</p>
			<p>The world is following the US elections perhaps more closely than ever before. It is a realisation that we need an America that uses its economic and military power for the good of the world.&nbsp; We need to re-establish the trust between Europe and the US after a very bruising period so that we can work together &#150; old friends and new friends &#150; to make the world a better place. It will not be easy, whatever the result next week. But the solution must be to work together as Europe so that we can talk as partners rather than poodles.</p>
