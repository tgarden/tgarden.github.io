<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The continuing conflict on the streets
between Palestinians and Israelis has moved from the front pages of
the British Press. Yet the killing continues, and the vast majority
of deaths and injuries are sustained by  Palestinian young people.
The official death toll has now reached 173 over the past 5 weeks.
President Clinton has invited Yasser Arafat and Ehud Barak to
Washington for separate talks on 9th and 12th November respectively.
It is by no means clear if anything helpful can be achieved by these
meetings. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The reality is that all three men are no
longer in control of the levers of power. The US electorate will have
chosen Bill Clinton's successor, and he will have entered the final
stages of the "lame duck" phase of his presidency. Neither the
Israelis nor the Palestinians will be able to assume that either
promises or threats from the US will  be carried through by the new
President and new Congress.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Prime Minister Ehud Barak is also in the
last throws of his political office. He retains power only by buying
ultra-Orthodox support with internal policies which alienate his key
supporters. His peace moves have made him the enemy of the Israeli
settlers, who are becoming as uncontrolled as the Palestinians on the
streets. Yasser Arafat's control over the Palestinian activists
remains uncertain. His freedom of manoeuvre is undoubtedly limited
given the disproportionate military response by Israel to
demonstrations. He will have considerable difficulty in selling any
proposals which try to put his people back in their second class
citizenship box. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Nobel Peace Prize winner, Shimon Peres, has
said that he believes that the time has come for direct talks between
Barak and Arafat without US involvement. It may be that is the next
stage if, as is likely, nothing comes from the Washington diplomacy.
Meanwhile the Palestinians, and their Arab neighbours, grow more
angry about the conduct of Israeli forces and well armed settlers.
Israeli citizens become more fearful for their own security as the
suicide bombers return. In a sane and fair world, the United Nations
would intervene, but the United States is unlikely to allow such
action. As a result the prognosis is very bad.</FONT></P>
