<H2><CENTER>Deterrence in Practice</CENTER></H2>

<P>The examination of the nuclear strategies of the seven nuclear
weapon states shows that the reasons behind the acquiring of nuclear
arsenals, and the practical objectives for their employment, vary not
only from country to country but also from one time to another.
Inevitably deterrence theory, as examined in the first part of this
book, has tended to concentrate on the question of the design and
utility of nuclear deterrence between the superpowers. Yet even
between these two, theory and practice do not always seem to be in
step. A number of factors seem to be important in the original
decision to produce nuclear weapons. Certainly, in the cases
examined, each country had a good scientific and technological base
on which to carry out the development. Other countries with
equivalent capabilities have not developed nuclear weapons, and it is
useful to tabulate the factors which may have prompted the decision
in the first seven to do so. </P>

<P>Table 1 gives a simplified breakdown of the objectives of each of
the seven countries, as they emerge from this examination. </P>

<P>World power status is, or was, of importance to the first five
nuclear powers, who are also the permanent members of the United
Nations Security Council. While the possession of nuclear weapons
does confer such status, they are certainly now a requirement.
National security objectives are common to all nuclear states. It
appears that countries seeking ideological leadership in the world
see a need to be nuclear armed. It might be possible to add India to
this category, on the grounds that it was wishing to maintain the
leadership of the non-aligned states. However, as there is no
evidence to support this, it has not been added. Only slightly
different is the concept of local area leadership. France certainly
looked upon nuclear weapons as a counter to German conventional
dominance. Alliance obligations can be viewed as an extension of
national security for those countries within alliances. The second
decision centre or - more unkindly - the nuclear trigger, is a role
for the lesser nuclear powers within alliances. It could in a
somewhat different sense be applied to lesser nuclear powers, perhaps
India and Israel, if they wished to be able to involve the
superpowers and thus gain their assistance. Although Israel may have
used this tactic to gain arms from the United States, it has not been
included. The procurement of nuclear weapons to offset conventional
weaknesses, or save on manpower, is a tendency among the Western
countries. It can reduce the expense of keeping large standing
conventional forces, justify expansion of nuclear arsenals, but
inevitably turns into a nuclear war-fighting force. The development
of nuclear weapons to generate internal prestige may be a factor.
However, the long development time necessary means that it is
unlikely to be the major objective; it may just affect the timing of
the programme. As the practical use of nuclear weapons in the present
world becomes more difficult to justify, the objective of keeping a
deterrent force as an insurance policy against an unknown future is
developing force as a justification. Britain and France openly hold
this view, and India must be keeping its option open on these
grounds. There seems to be evidence to suggest that scientific and
military pressures underlie the decision to go nuclear in all cases -
except possibly that of China. The weapons are scientifically
interesting and militarily powerful. The combination tends to put
pressure on the political decision makers to continue weapon
development. Finally, as a variation on the general question of
national security, the decision may be taken as a reaction to a
perceived nuclear threat from another nation. Thus, initially, the
Allies believed that Germany was well on the way to developing an
atomic bomb. Although the table points to America as the threat
perceived by the USSR, this may only be valid for the development of
thermonuclear weapons. </P>

<P>The short summaries of current postures are designed to do no more
than indicate the differences between the nations- The postures and
future trends that have been considered are relevant when the factors
affecting future stability are examined in the final part of this
book. It has been shown that the United States and the Soviet Union
have large nuclear arsenals, and an ability to use nuclear weapons at
all levels of conflict. Britain and France maintain small, but
nevertheless effective, nuclear forces which will insure their
security against the uncertain future. China has the potential for
much greater development, but as yet, probably for economic reasons,
remains a lesser nuclear power. India has in effect reverted to the
position of a near nuclear weapon power. Only Israel appears to have
both the capability and the likely need to use nuclear weapons, in a
way which might ensure survival. <TABLE BORDER=0>
