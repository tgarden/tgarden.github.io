			<h3>Who is running US Foreign Policy?</h3>
			<p>By Sir Timothy Garden</p>
		</div>
		<p>There were concerns in Europe last year that a Bush Presidency might lead to a more isolationist or unilateral US foreign policy. Many of these fears were quietened on the appointment of Colin Powell as the Secretary of State. The former General, who was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs during the Gulf War, was well known by the European establishment. Although he has a reputation for being very cautious in the use of military force, he also has a reputation as an internationalist and for his intellect and rationality. His statements since appointment have reinforced this view of him as a safe pair of hands. He made it clear on an early visit to NATO Headquarters that the US would remain committed in the Balkans as long as NATO remained there. His evidence to Congress was similarly reassuring. He was impressive in declaring that Africa was a priority for US Foreign Policy, and that the new administration would be working there to promote peace, to improve the economies, and to fight disease. On North Korea, he announced that the dialogue with South Korea would continue and that constructive engagement was the continuing US policy. There was also a perception Powell had rather more reservations about the utility of National Missile Defence than his colleagues in the Bush administration.</p>
		<p>Now there is a much greater question mark over who is running foreign policy. There is a growing feeling that Powell is outgunned by other senior members of the new administration. The change in policy on North Korea has been the most public U-turn by the Secretary of State. He had announced that the US would continue the Clinton policy of furthering reconciliation between North and South Korea. In meetings with a South Korean delegation in early March, he said: &#147;We do plan to engage with North Korea to pick up where President Clinton and his administration left off&#148;. The next day, President Bush made it clear that he had other ideas. In his first meeting with President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea, Bush said that he had serious doubts about recent US policy towards North Korea. While he was reviewing policy, he was not prepared to resume negotiations with North Korea, which he saw as a threat. This policy position may link more with the administration&#146;s plans for national missile defence than anything else. Certainly the response from Pyongyang will have helped  NMD advocates. The North Koreans have said that the new US position means that they will now reconsider their moratorium on long range missile tests. Poor Colin Powell was forced to tell reporters that his earlier remarks on policy were no longer effective.</p>
		<p>The question of policy on US troops in the Balkans is less clear. Before the American elections, Republican advisers were quite certain that there would be an early announcement, after a Bush victory, of a rapid phased withdrawal. Policing activities were seen as inappropriate for over-stretched US forces, when the Europeans should be able to manage the problem. However after the election, Colin Powell reassured NATO Secretary General George Robertson that Bosnia and Kosovo were seen as important NATO commitments. The Alliance had gone in together and would come out together. It now appears that US force levels are being revised downwards. This is happening just as the problems between Kosovo and Macedonia are worsening. It would be a very unfortunate sign if the US were to be seen as becoming less involved in peacekeeping in the region just as new trouble comes from Albanian ethnic groups.</p>
		<p>It is always difficult to identify where policy comes from in the US. The Defense Department is often at loggerheads with the State Department, and successive administrations have to compromise with Congressional sensitivities in mind. The new line up is not encouraging. While Colin Powell may be in the most important seat for making US foreign policy, he has a set of colleagues who may be giving George W.Bush very different advice. The Vice President, Dick Cheney, has been a former Defense Secretary. Donald Rumsfeld is on his second time round in that post. Condoleeza Rice, the National Security Adviser, is more aligned in her views to Cheney and Rumsfeld. There are no lack of international problems looming in Israel, Iraq, China, Indonesia, Korea, Macedonia and elsewhere where clear US policy will be needed. Powell may not be prepared to publicly backtrack on many more occasions. The question then will be whether he is prepared to provoke a resignation crisis. </p>
