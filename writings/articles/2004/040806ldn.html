			<p>Iraq is moving off the front pages to join Afghanistan in the foreign problems sections of the broadsheets. Tony Blair, sunning himself in the Caribbean, must be congratulating himself that the failures of his government in this unnecessary war will fade in the public mind. Yet Iraq may yet come back to bite him, his government and the rest of us sooner than he thinks.</p>
			<p>First,&nbsp; what is the current situation, and how likely is a stable Iraq in the near future? Obtaining objective data on reconstruction and security is not easy. The safety hazards mean that reporters tend to remain in more secure areas. Both the interim Iraqi government and the multi-national force commanders have an understandable interest in promoting an optimistic&nbsp; outlook. Some in the region, with other agendas, look to undermine such claims in order to subvert political progress.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Almost the last act of the Coalition Provisional Authority before it handed over to the Iraqi interim government was to publish a report on progress on reconstruction. An analysis of this data has been carried out by Professor Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. His conclusions make uncomfortable reading. Water improvement is far behind schedule; food security is between 25-40% below target; the electricity&nbsp; generation target has been deferred indefinitely; oil production is at two thirds of the December 2004 target. While hospital and school buildings have re-opened, equipment and supplies for both are lacking. Transport problems are great: air travel is not restored; rail is still being repaired; buses have been provided by Korea but security problems inhibit road travel. Telecommunications have improved only because of the advent of mobile phone systems.</p>
			<p>As Cordesman points out, CPA reporting has been very selective. The data shows funds committed to projects, rather than projects that been completed. The difference is clear when of the $18.4 billion in aid to Iraq, only $7.6 billion was committed and of that only $333 million had actually been spent over the first year.</p>
			<p>The House of Commons Foreign Affairs&nbsp; Committee drew on similar data for its report published on 21 July 2004. They concluded that &quot;the provision of basic services in Iraq is not yet satisfactory and that the failure to meet Iraqi expectations, whether realistic or not, risks damaging the credibility of the United Kingdom in Iraq and Iraqi goodwill towards it.&quot; They rightly called for the British government to publish data and progress towards targets for reconstruction.</p>
			<p>Improving the security situation is the key to progress in all aspects of reconstruction. It is clear that the interim government want to move to using Iraqi personnel on security duties as much as possible. Again the data shows how difficult this will be. At the end of June, only 5,857 of the 87,000 Iraqi police force had been fully trained. Indeed 57,000 were reported as having had no training at all. The figures are as bad for the army, the national guard, the facilities protection service, and the border security force. All these elements of national security forces will need to be trained. NATO agreed to help at its summit in Istanbul at the end of June, but members are still arguing over how this training will be provided.</p>
			<p>The bombings continue. The website www.iraqbodycount.net flicks its counters up to show between 11,300 and 13,300 Iraqi civilians killed. The stop press shows 60 injured in&nbsp; one more explosion. The Pentagon worries about its 1000 dead US servicemen milestone that is fast approaching. Disorder and anarchy give British military planners concerns for their sector. The Foreign Affairs Committee&nbsp; has warned that Iraq may become a failed state with regional instability. Tony Blair may yet find his misjudgements come back to haunt him.</p>
