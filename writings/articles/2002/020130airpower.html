<p class=MsoSubtitle style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;font-style:normal'>In looking at airpower and politics,
we have to answer the question whose politics and whose airpower. We get very
different answers on either side of the Atlantic. We have grown used to
airpower being the military force of choice for US politicians. It allows quick
response, and the ability to continue operations indefinitely if need be as we
see in Iraq, where ground forces would need some resolution to the crisis.
Politics is also about using what you have at hand when a crisis breaks. So in
a way the political choices open to our various leaders today, have been shaped
by the decisions of their predecessors of a decade ago, just as today they are
shaping the options for ten or more years ahead.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoSubtitle style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span

<p class=MsoSubtitle style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;font-style:normal'>As Chuck Horner indicated yesterday it is a complex picture, where to say that airpower is the first political choice glosses over the nuances of different needs for different circumstances. These differences between Europe and the US worry us all, and we will doubtless talk about them from a technological, doctrinal and political aspect. We heard yesterday that the US learned the constraints of NATO operations in Kosovo: the problems of consensus and target clearance. Yet how much difference to the outcome did the marginal change in targeting make? It would be as possible for some to argue that the weakest link in building an effective strategy was the US with its ban on contemplating a ground force option. That really did have an effect on the coercive effect of the campaign. Air power may be an easier political choice for the US, but its power can be undermined by reluctance to look at wider requirements of force. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoSubtitle style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;font-style:normal'>And for Europe, whatever its
preference, it is much constrained by the poor air power capabilities that it
fields. If the US opts for the air power role are we cast in the role of proxy
ground force to clear up the mess afterwards ñ a sort of standing Northern
Alliance. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

got and where we are heading given the political choices that have been made

<p class=Body style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:Times;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>The provision and maintenance of
appropriate and adequate national armed forces is an increasing challenge for
the rich nations of the world. In Europe, the transition from the standing
armies of the Cold War to more reactive and deployable forces is far from
complete despite 10 years of reshaping. In the UK, that decade has seen three
major defence reviews, and a fourth is<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>underway in the wake of 11 September. But a sustainable balance between
commitments, the capabilities needed to meet those commitments and the
resources provided to pay for the capabilities seems as far as ever from being
achieved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Body style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

<p class=Body style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:Times;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>It is increasingly apparent that,
looking ahead over the next two decades, traditional national approaches to
defence problems are not going to provide adequately for Europeís defence and
wider security needs. Collective security through NATO provided an affordable
answer to defence needs during the Cold War. In the 21st Century, the
capabilities required are more complex and difficult to define. At the same
time, the lack of an obvious direct threat from hostile states has led to
severe reductions in the funds made available to the military.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Much has been achieved in the
attempt to shift armed forces from their Cold War posture towards new, more usable
structures.. To all of this has now been added confusion about the role of the
military in countering international terrorism at home and abroad.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Body style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

<p class=Body style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:Times;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>The central issue of affordability
is neither new nor unfamiliar to politicians and defence administrators. But a
point is being reached where it can no longer be disguised or circumvented. For
decades the annual cost of a given unit of defence capability in most European
countries has been growing considerably faster than the year on year inflation
figure. A policy of level spending in real terms, which is the upper limit that
the UK or other European governments have aspired to for the past 15 years, has
therefore meant a constant decline in military capability. If we manage to keep
UK defence spending level in real terms, its share of GDP will have declined
from 5.3% in 1982 to 1.3% by 2020. Manpower costs are likely to have risen by
at least 20% (and perhaps much more given demographic trends) in real terms,
unit equipment costs will have more than doubled over the next two decades. The
frontline be no more than half the size that it is today. New generation
equipment may be more capable, but it will be very scarce. In any event, many
of the new tasks will call for manpower above all else. The police have learned
the lesson that numbers on the streets matter: many of the new military
challenges will require a comparable response. We shall therefore spend more
and more on army manpower at the expense of air and naval equipment. The rest
of Europe will be following a similar path towards having no useful combat
military capability - indeed many are a long way down this path already. We
should not conceal from ourselves that there will be a critical point, a
critical minimum, beyond which our forces will become unemployable in any
remotely challenging environment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Body style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:Times;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Many unsuccessful efforts have been
made in the past to defeat defence inflation. If precedent is any guide, they
will ultimately not make a significant difference. And unless European
governments can find a way to get a significantly better return for each unit
of defence expenditure, starting relatively soon, their ability, separately or
collectively, to take substantive military action in defence of their interests
is going to evaporate. Even before the reality of military ineffectiveness
becomes established, the perception of it will mean European governments losing
whatever influence they have over US defence and security policy as well as the
support of their electorates for whatever levels of defence expenditure then
obtain. The only escape from this dilemma is for European governments to begin
to integrate a financially significant percentage of the effort they devote to
defence. The political difficulties will be very great. But so will be the consequences
of a failure to grapple with the issue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Body style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:Times'>We Europeans are living at an exciting and critical time for
the future of our security arrangements. We have the opportunity to move
forward to a defence posture that will make the world safer, NATO stronger and
Europe more secure. It will be a tragedy if we fail to seize the moment. We
have grown used to the security blanket that NATO gave us throughout the Cold
War, but the world has changed, and we must respond to that change. In this
presentation, I would like to give a personal view on the nature of the
challenge; why the future shape our air power is so important; the difficulties
we face; the limitations of the current approach; and finally some thoughts on
an approach which would bring us new real affordable capabilities in relatively
short timescales.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>To
develop European capabilities, Member States have set themselves the Helsinki
Headline Goal. Most of the problems of non-congruence between European NATO
members and the EU have been solved. We have now, in theory, an outline plan
for progress in improving European defence capabilities in a way which works
with the grain of NATO. That is a remarkable step forward given the reluctance
of the US and the UK in past years to address these issues. But there are many
difficulties ahead. NATO would claim to have a planning process, and to have
expended much effort over the years on coercing nations into setting more
challenging force goals for themselves. In practice, the achievement of the
process has been limited, particularly in the past decade. The institutional
arrangements will almost certainly delay the development of the agreed
capability. The omens are not good given the lack of progress on the Defence Capabilities
Initiative<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(DCI) that has preceded
this very limited aim for meeting the Helsinki Goals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>But
this is not the only problem. Defence capability in Europe is set to decline to
near extinction because of the remorseless pressure of defence inflation.
Governments are reluctant to do more than keep defence spending level in real
terms while there is no threat to their national territory. Personnel and
equipment costs rise at a faster rate than domestic retail prices. Militaries
are rationalised to bridge the gap in resources. Perversely those nations who
have been most radical in their rationalisations (such as the UK and the
Netherlands) have least room for manoeuvre now. Capability cuts are inevitable
and will become progressively more serious, particularly at the expensive end
of military force. Europe has pretty well opted out of military use of space,
will air power be next?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Of
course, you may wish to argue that the events of 11 September will have changed
this calculus. There is now a realisation that there are serious security
threats to national territory. This will have strengthened the political
impetus in the US to increase defence spending. In Europe there seems to be
little sign of a parallel effect. In the UK, the Defence Secretary talks of
rebalancing the defence programme, which suggests that whatever extra
capability is needed to meet the new threats from international terrorism will
have to come from current defence funding.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h2 style='line-height:200%'>Political Pros and Cons of Airpower<span
style='font-weight:normal'><o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The
experience of the past 10 years in the Gulf War, the Balkans and now in
Afghanistan have made<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>the
political attractions of air campaigns much stronger. When diplomacy fails,
military force can be applied rapidly through modern airpower, and casualties
to own forces can be minimised. Yet the procurement costs of<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>modern air systems are daunting for
every nation except the United States. As a result, the gap in capability to
wage an air war has widened between the US and all other nations. This has had
two unfortunate results. For the allies of the US, particularly the rest of
NATO, there has been an assumption that American capabilities will always be
available when needed, and therefore declining expenditure on the expensive air
capabilities is politically acceptable. For states and non-state actors who
wish to challenge the West, the lesson has been that attacks must be mounted in
unconventional ways. The destruction of the World Trade Center was achieved
despite the overwhelming technological military lead of the USA.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Yet
a declining ability to participate in a meaningful way in air campaigns has
generated a political problem for Europe. As its military contribution becomes
less relevant, it finds that both nationally and as the EU, it has less and
less influence on US foreign policy. In parallel, there is a decline in
regional defence industrial capability as the US market is the technological
leader, and is driven by the US domestic market.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The
likely long term implications of these trends are to reduce the relevance of
NATO as an operational organisation. Afghanistan has shown that the US has
learned the lessons of Kosovo. It is easier and more efficient to do such
campaigns nationally rather than as a military alliance. Thus it is in Europe's<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>vital interest to find a way to do
better in the fielding of effective military capability, and particularly in
air systems. If the European decline continues, NATO will become irrelevant,
and the US may decide that Europe should sort its own security problems out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Using
the Kosovo campaign as a benchmark for a modern military operation which should
be within the capability of European nations, we can break out the scale of
effort that might be needed in future. The campaign needed to be able to call
upon the traditional mix of air defence fighters, bombers, close air support,
reconnaissance, airborne early warning, air-to-air refuelling, strategic
airlift, tactical fixed wing and rotary transport capabilities. Although the
maritime aspects of the operation were limited, it must be assumed that some
future campaigns might need the appropriate mix of maritime reconnaissance, air
defence, attack and anti-submarine warfare air assets. Discussion of Helsinki
has focused on the troop requirements, but it is these air power needs which
will pose the greatest challenges.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The
EU nations together have elements of all of these air power capabilities. They
field some 3235 combat aircraft with a total air force manpower of 380,000. If
the NATO non-EU members are added (Czech Republic, Hungary, Iceland, Norway,
Poland and Turkey) the numbers rise to 4281 combat aircraft and 530,000 men.
These large air power assets are however balanced to provide the defensive
posture that was appropriate to the static defence requirements of the Cold
War. They are also, in many cases, managed in such small packets as to be
inefficient. All forces have a strong air defence element reflecting the
requirement to defend their own territory. While many of the fighters can be
used in a bombing role, they are not all weather capable and aircrew will not
have undertaken primary training in this role. For offensive air operations,
the only EU nations with a significant primary capability are France, Germany,
Italy and the UK, who can field around 500 aircraft in an all weather bombing
mode. Although the limitations placed on the potential collateral damage in
peace support operations may mean that our definition of ìall weatherî is
becoming more restrictive. Looking at the scale of offensive air capability
needed for the Gulf and Kosovo, Europe needs to work at providing perhaps 50%
more all weather bombers than it can at present. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>However,
the platform is only part of the question in modern air campaigns. Military
needs and political requirements mean that in future operations, precision
weapons will be the norm. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h2 style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-weight:normal'>In
any discussion about improving European defence capabilities, the argument
usually begins with a plea for more spending on defence. It is also argued that
greater integration of defence industries would be beneficial. Neither approach
has much prospect of early success, and there can be no confidence that either
would generate real enhancements in capability without a radical restructuring.
Putting aside the political difficulties, Europe could undoubtedly organise its
defence spending more efficiently if it were done on an integrated basis in the
same way that the United States organises its armed forces at the Federal
level. Such an approach for Europe will not be possible for many years (if
ever), as it will necessary for EU member nations to give up national

the near term (the next 5 years), it would be much more productive to look for
opportunities to rationalise forces in being which can be operated more
efficiently on a multilateral or EU-wide basis. The model for such a
supranational activity is the NATO AWACs force, which has successfully provided
an airborne early warning capability to NATO members at much lower day-to-day
operating cost than would have been the case if operated on an individual
national basis.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:Times;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>For a number of reasons aircraft
capabilities offer the possibility of much more quickly achieved improvements.
Air procedures are already well harmonised between nations. English has become
the universal language of the air, and this considerably eases the problem of
mounting international combined air operations. Most importantly, given the
high unit cost of air force platforms, it is not surprising that many nations
operate common equipment. This also eases the problems of rationalisation.
Finally, the high costs of infrastructure to support air operations mean that
modest rationalisation can pay high dividends in achieving greater military
capability at lower cost.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:Times;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Airlift is an obvious example of a
capability that Europe needs and that could operate on a similar basis to NATO
AWACS. If forces are to be deployed rapidly, they need to be able to call on a
significant airlift capability. In looking for an opportunity for early
rationalisation, we need to identify an aircraft type that is common to many EU
members. The air tactical transport role is a capability that most nations
require. Some ten EU nations operate some 137 C130 Hercules tactical transport
aircraft. Pooling of some of these widely used C130 could provide an immediate
European tactical fixed wing transport capability. Provided that nations
structured their contributions sensibly, they could make operating cost savings
at the national level through closure of bases, training units, and
headquarters. Indeed this must be the criteria for such moves: bases closed,
manpower reduced and cost savings. The level of saving would depend on the
degree to which each nation felt able to rely on the supporting infrastructure
being provided by a European facility.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:Times;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>In a slightly longer timescale, the
requirement for a large strategic airlift capability could be tackled. The
operation of such a fleet could easily be managed by the same organisation that
would look after the tactical C130 pooled capability. It would be possible to
procure a new capability whether it is in the end A400M, C17s or Antonov
strategic transport aircraft that could either be operated by the military or
on a leased basis from a commercial company. In either case the costs would be
much lower than each nation trying to operate a very small fleet of large and
expensive aircraft. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

also needed by all European air forces, and would be a natural candidate for a
European fleet operation. Consideration is being given to procuring the UK air
to air refuelling capability through a public private partnership arrangement.
This would be particularly easy to enlarge to encompass those nations in Europe
that sought such a facility. The economics of the operation would improve for
the larger fleet and there would be no sovereignty issues to worry about given
the service was being provided by the private sector. For the UK, this could be
a particularly attractive option, given that a large amount of money in the
defence programme is currently posited against a national capability. A better
capability could be achieved at a lower cost.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

and Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) are two roles, which are expensive in
equipment and training, but which could offer opportunities for building up EU
capabilities to operate with the US forces available to NATO. There will be
considerable development in the use of UAVs for the tactical reconnaissance
role, and there is a desire for a European satellite-based strategic
reconnaissance capability. Both of these capabilities will be expensive, but
are essential in the long term if Europe is serious in its intention to provide
autonomous military capability. The information exploitation organisation will
again be much more cost-effective if operated at the supranational level. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

level, one or two aircraft carriers do not constitute a viable and reliable
force, and the opportunity costs are severe for other defence capabilities. The
timescale is sufficiently long for interested EU nations to look at how they
might jointly contribute to a force of 4 or 5 aircraft carriers with their
supporting ships and aircraft. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

capabilities will be difficult for a number of reasons. The equipment used by
nations is diverse, and much of it outdated; the national exploitation is
jealously guarded; and there are bilateral difficulties with wider information
sharing. For these reasons, it would probably be more effective to build up a
new EU intelligence capability from scratch. This would be expensive, but would
allow a fully integrated modern system to be established relatively quickly. If
the EU wanted to focus on one area for priority action, then Intelligence would
provide it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Elements and common support and logistic services could provide building blocks
for the strengthening of European defence capabilities. They would make more
effective use of European national defence budgets through the removal of the
cost overhang of separate support systems. There would remain a problem of the
&quot;free-rider&quot; nation, although the audit and capability criteria
proposals of the Helsinki Summit may help to stimulate contributions from EU

the much longer term, it is possible to contemplate the gradual development of
the European Air Force as experience of pooling forces is gained. Confidence
would grow with experience of the greater availability of air power assets to
individual nations, to the EU and to NATO. Such a force would be in the lead
for a wider integration of European defence capabilities, which would require
the development of a European defence budget. Nations would still be able to
retain independent national air and other capabilities if they so wished, but
such national military power would not count as a contribution in European
defence budget terms. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>There
is a close parallel in these proposals with the original evolution of
independent national air forces. Armies and navies wanted to own their own air
power, and were concerned about becoming too dependent on an independent air
force, which would be centrally controlled at the higher level. The costs,
confusion and inefficiencies of maintaining army and naval air forces
eventually led nations to form a third service which could procure and use air
power effectively. The next stage for such sensible rationalisation must be an
integration of air power across national boundaries. Those national boundaries
may have had physical meaning on the ground and at sea, but are irrelevant in
the air of Europe today. If the political will were there, Europe could produce
effective modern air power, and could even do it more cost effectively than
does the United States.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is an exciting and challenging prospect, where air forces could once again show
that they were at the leading edge of thinking. The prize is a real usable capability
for Europe and for NATO. If we continue as we have for the past decade, air
power will become another unaffordable specialist activity, which only the
United States can provide. European nations will decide that they would be
better to concentrate on the simple capabilities that they can afford. New
Zealand rather than AWACs will have shown the way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
