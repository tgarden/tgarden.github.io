			<h3>Sea Harriers Go Early</h3>

			<p>Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon announces the new &quot;Migration strategy for the Joint Force Harrier&quot;. This rather technical sounding programme involves the early phasing out of the Royal Navy Sea Harrier Force.  There will be concerns in many quarters that the loss of this unique sea-based fighter capability is another indication of problems in funding the UK defence programme. Last month the RAF lost a Tornado F3  air defence fighter squadron, and now  the Fleet Air Arm will lose all 24 of its Sea Harrier FA2s which are divided between 3 squadrons. The run down is expected to take place between 2004 and 2006. The MOD are taking a strong line that this is a sensible route to the new aircraft carrier capability which arrives in 2012. The arguments are complex and will need careful handling.<br>
				<br>
				The Joint Harrier Force, conceived during the Strategic Defence Review, is up and running with a mixture of Navy and RAF Harrier aircraft. Unfortunately, the Sea Harrier and the RAF's Harrier GR7  share little in common apart from the name and an ability to hover. The Sea Harrier is an updated version of the original British designed Harrier aircraft. It has a good radar and air defence missile system, but suffers from insufficient power and an elderly airframe. As a result range and endurance are limited for carrier operations, and the problem becomes critical in warm climates. The RAF Harrier GR7 is a second generation and design of aircraft, and is a version of the American AV8B. It is to be upgraded over the next 3 years with a yet more powerful engine, and also the ability to operate the new range of precision weapons. It will then be known as the Harrier GR9. <br>
				<br>
				The new plan sees the Joint Harrier Force changing from a mixture of Sea Harriers and  Harrier GR7s  to a single fleet of Harrier GR9s. There will be savings in logistics, maintenance and training costs that come from a common fleet. There will also be a considerable saving from the reduction of number of aircraft to be operated. The current Joint Harrier Force has a total of 113 aircraft; after the migration to the GR9 this is expected to reduce to 71 aircraft. Not only will the 3 Sea Harrier squadrons disappear, but the four GR7 squadrons of 12 aircraft each will reduce to 9 GR9 aircraft per squadron. This reduces the pilot requirement at a time when both the Fleet Air Arm and the RAF are suffering from shortages.<br>
				<br>
				But the MOD claims that the savings in money and manpower are not the driving force for this change. Certainly there is no improvement in operational capability in the near term. The prime role of the Sea Harrier was to provide air defence for a Carrier force. Missiles aboard surface ships can provide point defence, but do not allow the area defence necessary to control air space. Without the Sea Harrier, the MOD will have to think very carefully where it places its carriers for operations. In practice they will need to be assured that the US Navy will be able to give continuous air defence cover if they are within range of possible hostile powers. This is not very different from what already happens, but, at a time when Allies are being pressed to do more, it may be seen by the USA as a move in the wrong direction. It would be possible to upgrade the GR9 further so that it had a suitable radar to operate in the fighter role, but this would cost more money than the MOD are prepared to pay when they are expecting the Joint Strike Fighter to provide all their needed capabilities from 2012 onwards.<br>
				<br>
				So why is this drop in operational capability being accepted if budgets are not the key? The rationale is that these moves are necessary in order to make a coherent transition to the new force envisaged for the two new aircraft carriers which are due in 2012 and 2015. A single aircraft type, the Joint Strike Fighter, would have replaced all Naval and RAF Harriers in any case. To have updated the Sea Harrier as well as the GR7 would not have been sensible, particularly as the need is to promote offensive airpower. In addition, the merger of the aircrew and, even more importantly, the engineering support from RAF and RN will take time. By doing it this way, they will be ready as a truly joint force to take on the JSF when it arrives. <br>
				<br>
				On balance, recognition of the limitations of the Sea Harrier is overdue. However, the loss of a key capability in any maritime operation is a concern. The final design of the Joint Strike Fighter has still to be agreed. It would be a brave prophet who forecast a delivery date. Even the upgrades to the GR7 carry technical risk of delay. The acute shortage of Royal Navy Harrier pilots will be less obvious in the merged squadrons of the Joint Harrier Force, and the RAF will be able to absorb its displaced aircrew to fill empty cockpits elsewhere. However, the effect on long term retention and recruitment will take some time to see. It is not clear whether it will be positive or negative for either service. Perhaps the greatest question will be why the new big aircraft carriers are so important in 2012 and 2015 if we feel we can limp along until then with our small capability reduced yet further.<br>
				<br>
				Finally, it is surprising to see this important force change being agreed ahead of the work on the extra chapter to the SDR due in the Summer. There will however we a welcome for the early guidance to the FAA staff at Yeovilton as to the new timetable for their family moves north.<br>
