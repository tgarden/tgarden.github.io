			<h3>Still Bombing Iraq</h3>
			<p><i>by Sir Timothy Garden</i></p>

			<p>A decreasing number of allies have been bombing Iraq on and off for the last decade. When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in August 1990, the United States was able to lead a large coalition of air forces in a prolonged air campaign from mid January 1991 until the end of February. After their expulsion from Kuwait,  the Iraqis took repressive measures against Kurds in the North of the country and Shias in the South. The West responded by establishing and policing  two no-fly zones. Iraqi military flying activity was banned in the southern zone up to latitude 33 North, and in the northern zone down to 36 North. This left a narrow band with no overfights, which included Baghdad, across the centre of Iraq. US, British and French aircraft routinely patrolled the zones from bases in Turkey and Saudi Arabia, and for the most part the world forgot about this curious arrangement. </p>
			<p>After Saddam Hussein expelled the UN weapons inspectors in 1998, Iraqi air defences became more active against these no-fly zone patrols. When a short sharp campaign to destroy Iraqi nuclear, biological and chemical weapon facilities was mounted in December 1998, only the UK was prepared to support the Americans in their Operation Desert Fox. Subsequently, the two nations have continued to police the no-fly zones, but have taken offensive action whenever threatened by Iraqi air defences. These threats have been getting more severe over recent months. In part this is because the Iraqis have had ten years to improve their defences and to observe the RAF and USAF tactics. It is also because Saddam Hussein perceives great advantage in bringing down a Western aircraft at a time when his Arab neighbours are less than enthused by US policy over Israel.</p>
			<p>It is little short of amazing that no British or American aircraft has been lost over Iraqi territory. Even in peacetime training, it is not unusual for some mechanical or other failure to cause the loss of a military aircraft over this number of missions. Iraqi air defence operators have had years to hone their techniques, and to try different tactics. The central zone of the country has been largely left untouched, and is therefore the militarily sensible place to put the most capable control systems. We should not be surprised therefore, that aircrews have been pushing for an opportunity to take out these threats to their survival. Indeed from a military point of view, the bombing of air defence centres around Baghdad of last week is entirely reasonable. There are however a number of interesting political questions to be answered.</p>
			<p>First, there is some dispute over which of the two partners pushed for this operation. Commentators in the US have been indicating that Tony Blair fired up the new Bush administration. His line was that he was not prepared to let the risk against RAF aircrew grow any further. Other insiders suggest that the US organised the raid without full consultation with their British allies. Certainly, it seems very odd that three days after the raid, the MOD website makes no reference to the operation. Indeed its headline news is about  the Nottingham Chamber of Commerce. Nor was the timing very good from the Government&#146;s point of view, given that the Labour Party Spring Conference was hardly like to give a standing ovation to unannounced bombing of Iraq. </p>
			<p>Some have suggested that the timing of the operation was fine in the light of Tony Blair&#146;s first visit to George W. Bush. Certainly it will have reminded the new administration that the UK is its only reliable partner in Europe on defence matters. Whether that will make it any easier for Blair to discuss National Missile Defence problems with the new President is arguable. The US line has been hardening, and there is an expectation that the UK will meekly endorse NMD plans. Furthermore, the Bush team are likely to be even more obstructive over European defence force proposals given the French adverse reaction to this offensive in Iraq.</p>
			<p>Perhaps the most interesting question is why the whole operation has hit the headlines now. It was certainly a more concentrated offensive than has been the norm since Desert Fox. However, it was the usual limited strike against air defence systems. Some targets were located outside of the no-fly zones, but the missiles were launched from within the zones. Incidentally, this probably means that all the near-Baghdad targets were struck by US missiles. The RAF aircraft are poorly equipped to undertake longer range stand-off attacks. President Bush kept repeating that this was a &#147;routine&#148; operation. It is difficult to believe that the world media would have locked on without a bit of help from the Republican spin doctors. </p>
			<p>Tony Blair may find that holding on to the close relationship with the United States is going to be an exciting ride. Next time, moving Peter Hain may not be enough. Certainly he is unlikely to have improved his image on the Continent with this latest adventure. There will be a growing European consensus on the need to address the problem of Iraq in more constructive ways.</p>
