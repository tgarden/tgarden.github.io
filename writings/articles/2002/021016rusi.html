			<h4><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The Problem</font></h4>
			<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Oil (and I include gas in this) as we have heard from other speakers remains at the centre of our strategic needs. We shall deal with the alternatives to this dependence later in the conference. But my contribution will be to look at the security implications of this dependence, and how we can handle the problems that arise from key vulnerabilities to the supply. There are also second order effects that I need to address. Actions that we take to preserve particular energy sources may have knock on effects. I am no expert on the financial markets, but it is clear that security actions, real or anticipated, can have severe effects on the price of oil, which in turn if long lasting can effect the supply either positively or negatively. <br>
					<br>
					I will talk about the management of supply from the military security aspect. However that supply may be threatened by a number of factors which require different approaches. </font></p>
			<ul>
				<li><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">We may need to provide military help to a friendly state under threat from outside. Kuwait and the 1991 Gulf War is the prime example</font>
				<li><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">We may feel the need to stabilise a state which is under internal threat, which if undermined would cause unpredictable supply effects. </font>
				<li><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">We may have a separate security agenda with an oil providing state which will have implications for production. The current position over Iraq is an example of this, and I will spend a little time on the possible implications.</font>
				<li><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Perhaps as importantly as the relationship with oil producing states, future oil security will increasingly need to take into account violent non-state actors. Counter-terrorism will be partially about maintaining key strategic supply lines safe as well as about preserving the lives of our citizens. I will spend a little time on this aspect as well.</font>
			</ul>
			<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Finally, I will trespass a little into the area of what we may do to reduce dependence on oil and gas. Some of the solutions that may be under consideration do themselves pose a number of questions about security.</font></p>
			<h4><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Defending the Oil Producers</font></h4>
			<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">First then, we have military capabilities to defend friendly oil producing countries from the threat of attack by their neighbours. Kuwait was invaded by Iraq. At one level this was a simple UN authorised military operation to oust the invader. However, few doubt that the alacrity with which the ad hoc coalition was built up owed much to the fear of control by Iraq of Kuwait's vast oil supplies. There was also an implicit threat to Saudi Arabia. <br>
					<br>
					The major energy consumers have therefore demonstrated both a will and a capability to defend their energy supplies when threatened. Since the Gulf War, the size of western military forces have decreased significantly (by around 40% in raw numbers). However, the capability of the US with a number of European states greatly exceeds any potential invader of a major oil producing state. Indeed, many countries have been reshaping their forces better to be able to conduct these sorts of operations.</font></p>
			<h4><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Stabilising Oil Producers</font></h4>
			<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">It seems unfortunate that there is something of a correlation between political instability and the geological formation necessary for oil reserves. Of course in some countries, the rapid arrival of oil wealth may have caused some of the internal tensions. There is certainly a military security aspect to the foreign policy aims of the consumers in respect of trying to bolster friendly regimes among the oil producers. <br>
					<br>
					This support can of course backfire, as it did so spectacularly with the Shah of Iran. The support of unpopular regimes by western powers can give rise to long term antipathy among the next generation of rulers. Nevertheless, the economic drivers both of security of energy supply, but also to recirculate the petro dollars through exports remain uppermost in foreign policy thinking. The arms sales and military support are big money earners from countries like Saudi Arabia, but also in the Gulf States. Unfortunately in some cases corruption associated with arms sales can do more to undermine internal stability. It is important that as much effort goes into improving good governance in oil producing states as goes into lucrative, but perhaps unnecessary, arms contracts.</font></p>
			<h4><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Implications of Military actions</font></h4>
			<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Let me turn to the implications for energy security of other military actions by the major military powers. I will not take the line that the current US focus on Iraq is all about oil. Doubtless some both inside the Administration and outside would look upon Iraqi oil as important element. It is certainly being used as a bargaining chip for negotiations with the French and Russians in the UN Security Council. But we do not need to assume that it is the main driver for the current crisis in order to think through possible implications for future energy supplies.<br>
					<br>
					Let us assume that the rationale for putting Saddam Hussein high on the US military hit list is primarily the increasing concerns about his development of weapons of mass destruction. Since the UN inspectors left four years ago, information has mainly come from defectors and overhead surveillance. The patrolling of the No Fly Zones by US and UK air forces has undoubtedly also kept the Iraqi military focused on their own survival. Sanctions will have hampered technical imports. Nevertheless, these loose constraints will have left some leeway for work to continue on all aspects of the Iraqi weapons' programme. It may be that intelligence assessments are now driving the sense of urgency for doing something about Iraq, although the UK Government's dossier published last month was less than convincing about the urgency.<br>
					<br>
					Nor are we talking just about Iraq. The USA has in its new strategic doctrine published last month showed that it is moving from a strategy based on deterrence and containment to one of pre-emption where necessary. Iraq is just number one on a list. The requirement is for regime change. presumably any new regime would not just be disarmed of its WMD, but will also be friendly in terms of oil supplies. I leave it to the oil price experts to gives us the implications of a freely flowing oil supply from Iraq. The drop in price would presumably be significant.</font></p>
			<h4><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Iraq Operational Options </font></h4>
			<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">What are the options? We could continue as before. Sometimes the current strategy is to be preferred, if all alternatives are worse. However this now seems impossible with the UN fully involved. The UN may get the inspectors back in with unfettered access.  The US may still be unsatisfied. A wider air campaign could be used to destroy identified WMD facilities.. There might be an Afghanistan style campaign which sought to use proxy and special forces on the ground with massive air support to change the regime. Finally, a full scale ground and air war may be undertaken to replace the Iraqi power structure..<br>
					<br>
					How practical are the military options? We have a measure of the scale of military force needed for a campaign against Iraq. In the 1991 Gulf War, a ground force of around 250,000 was assembled to expel the Iraqi invaders from Kuwait. In the event, the prolonged air campaign meant that the ground forces had a relatively easy time, and were able to retake Kuwait in under a week. An attack on Iraq would be a much large war aim, with the need to secure a much greater area. The time taken by the pre-cursor air campaign would give Iraq plenty of opportunity to cause trouble in the region. A ground force at least as large as for the Gulf War would be a wise precaution. However basing for such forces might be more difficult than ten years ago. Without a clear UN resolution, Saudi Arabia is unlikely to welcome yet more foreign troops.<br>
					<br>
					There is also the question of whether allies will be either willing or able to contribute to such an operation. It has been suggested that the UK might be asked to provide 10% of the ground troops. That would amount to a quarter of the British Army. Already pulled in so many directions, it seems difficult to see how this could be managed without considerable damage to operations in Afghanistan, the Balkans and in Northern Ireland. The fireman's strike will need 19,000 troops to man the Green Goddesses. This could be the final breaking point for British forces, which seem to be needed to be in the lead everywhere.</font></p>
			<h4><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Three Scenarios</font></h4>
			<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The discussion so far has been entirely from the view of what options are open to the US and its allies. However in any conflict, the action of the enemy is the most important element. It is impossible to predict with certainty, and, once fighting starts, the course of a war becomes very uncertain. It is possible to build a large number of scenarios for a war against Iraq by speculating about possible Iraqi responses. The three that follow are chosen, not because they are probable, but because they are among the many that are possible.</font></p>
			<address><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Scenario One.</font></address>
			<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Turkey, Kuwait, Qatar provide full basing support. Major US strategic air campaign using cruise missiles, carrier borne aircraft, local based air power and long range air power. No US ground force deployments. Iraq rides out attacks and invites world's press in to see collateral damage. Anti-American feeling in the region increases, basing support withdrawn. There would be the possibility of Arab oil sanctions against US. Increase in terrorism in west.</font></p>
			<address><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Scenario Two</font></address>
			<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Air campaign as scenario one paralleled by increasing ground force presence in Turkey, Israel and Gulf States. Special forces operations increase in Iraq, particularly near sites suspected of involvement of WMD development. Northern Kurds secure region with help of US operations in middle of country. Iraq troops move to border with Jordan and threaten missile attacks on Israel. Outcome very unpredictable. Given Saddam Hussein's history of destroying oil facilities during the withdrawal from Kuwait, it can be expected that at minimum , he would repeat this approach if facing defeat in Iraq.</font></p>
			<address><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Scenario Three</font></address>
			<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Regime change achieved in Baghdad after attrition warfare campaign, but Saddam Hussein followers continue undercover operations both in Iraq (including against oil fields), but also abroad. The US is sufficiently worried by this scenario to consider the need for a national smallpox vaccination policy. The country is run by the US military for the indefinite future. Oil producing infrastructure remains a target for internal dissidents.<br>
					<br>
					It is possible to build scenarios where the outcome is much more benign, but the military planner needs to consider the possible bad outcomes in order to take sensible precautions.   What seems likely under any outcome is a greater feeling of antipathy to the US and its Allies. There may be a greater amount of support for Islamic opposition within currently friendly states. The long term outlook may not therefore be terribly good for maintaining supply of oil and gas.</font></p>
			<h4><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Terrorism and Oil Security</font></h4>
			<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The events of 11 September have brought a realisation that non-State actors can wreak havoc on the economies of States. The attack on the US was strategic in nature, and al-Qaeda is set on bringing down the US and its allies as major economic powers. The developed world offers a lucrative target set to determined terrorists. While the World Trade Centre was a key financial centre as well as a symbolic target, we must expect our dependence on oil and gas to be a focus for future attacks. Since much of the most fundamentalist Islamic teaching emanates from the oil rich middle east region, it would be surprising if oil was not seen by al-Qaeda as a major opportunity. <br>
					<br>
					It is not my intention to provide a menu of choices for terrorist organisations. We can point to the explosion of the French tanker off Yemen. While the event is still under investigation, it gives a good example of what is possible. But those involved in counter-terrorism must look at the vulnerabilities in the whole of the energy supply chain. Saddam Hussein set fire to the Kuwaiti production facilities and caused great damage to the environment and delay in getting the oilfields back in action. They will be targets for future terrorists. Oil and gas are not just vulnerable when in tankers; the long pipelines in being and planned will require constant protection. The consumer nations with their vulnerable refineries, often near centres of population, also need to think through the defences. The national economic implications of uncertain supply and destruction of major infrastructure  could be considerable.<br>
					<br>
					Of course energy is only one of the possible targets for terrorists. The killing in Bali shows that other economic targets (in this case tourism) are options for the terrorist. This makes the problem of prevention and intelligence both more important and more difficult.</font></p>
			<h4><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Replacement Energy sources &amp; Security</font></h4>
			<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Finally, let me address the question of moving away from oil and gas, or at least reducing dependence. There are many reasons to do this. Security is one, the environment another. Yet we have to be careful that we don not open new vulnerabilities. A move to greater use of nuclear energy would provide more potential targets for terrorists, and also increase the difficulty of controlling nuclear material.</font></p>
			<h4><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Conclusion</font></h4>
			<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The military security aspects of maintaining oil security can only be considered as one part of the overall picture. Indeed too much focus on military aspects can be counter-productive in the ling term. Intelligence must remain the key element for future security of energy supplies. The prospects are not good as the demands increase, and the non state intervention becomes more targeted. All ot this reinforces the pressure to find alternative sustainable energy sources and also to reduce demand by improving efficiency.<br>
