			<h3>Thinking Grand Strategy</h3>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Military historians differentiate between <i>Grand Strategy</i> and the more practical operational concerns of strategy and tactics. Grand strategy defines policy objectives at the national&nbsp; level and is the province of government ministers. As the official British Defence Doctrine handbook says: &quot;Churchill said that the art of grand strategy was to foresee the outlines of the future and be prepared to deal with it. Thus grand strategy must be forward looking to anticipate the various ways in which a potential opponent (and any other participants) might react both before and after military action has been initiated.&quot; Military strategy is the servant of grand strategy, and is the high level planning to achieve the government aim within the resource and other constraints that Ministers may set. From this military strategic plan, the operational planning shapes the campaign plan, which in turn determines the tactical employment of the armed forces.&nbsp; Thus everything depends on a sound strategic approach by Government at the start.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>Containment to Intervention</h3>
			<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
			<p>In the 1991 Gulf War, the grand strategy was clear and unchanged throughout.&nbsp; The British Government declared that the defence of Saudi Arabia and the sovereignty of Kuwait were matters of&nbsp; UK national interest. This led to the framing and passing of UN Security Council Resolution 678 as the grand strategic objective. The successful military operation followed with clear guidelines and an agreed view on the required end state. For the next decade, the UK government strategy was to prevent Iraq threatening its neighbours again, to ensure that it was unable to develop and deploy weapons of mass destruction, and to provide some protection to Kurdish and Shia minorities inside the country. The strategy was one of containment through a mixture of economic, diplomatic and military measures. We now know that this strategy was almost entirely successful. Iraq's forces were kept weak and could not threaten neighbours. No new weapons of mass destruction were developed or deployed after the UN inspectors supervised destruction of stocks in the early 1990s. The No Fly Zones resulted in an autonomous northern Kurdish area of Iraq; but were less successful in providing cover for the Shias in the south of the country.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The Butler report makes clear that something happened in the first half of 2002 which changed the British Government's strategy. Butler also deduces: &quot;The Government's conclusion in the spring of 2002 that stronger action (although not necessarily military action) needed to be taken to enforce Iraqi disarmament was not based on any new development in the current intelligence picture on Iraq&quot;. Many commentators&nbsp; would agree with Butler&nbsp; that the meeting between Tony Blair and George W. Bush on 6-7 April 2002 at Crawford was significant.&nbsp; Blair is reported as confirming his new thinking&nbsp; as: &quot;What has changed is not the pace of Saddam Hussein's WMD programmes but our tolerance of them post 11 September.&quot;&nbsp; But if the new grand strategic concern was potential linkage between future WMD and 9/11 style terrorism, why did this translate into military intervention in Iraq?</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Containment of Iraq was a blunt but surprisingly effective instrument. Military intervention was bound to have much more uncertain consequences. The failure of Tony Blair was &quot;was to foresee the outlines of the future&quot; as Churchill had described the role of leadership in grand strategy. Many argued that a military operation without overwhelming international support could destabilise the region, strengthen Islamic extremism and encourage WMD proliferation elsewhere. Some predicted the consequential serious damage to relationships within NATO and the EU.&nbsp; If Blair failed to make the right call in 2002, his lack of strategic vision was further compromised by ignoring new intelligence as it became available. To have strategic vision, a leader must know the questions to ask. We have all struggled to understand how the Prime Minister (and also his Defence Secretary) did not know that the infamous&nbsp; &quot;45 minute&quot;&nbsp; claim was about battlefield weapons. As puzzling is why neither of them asked for a re-evaluation of the original intelligence&nbsp; on WMD in early 2003. Once Dr Blix and his inspectors were in Iraq, it became possible to check many of the weaker assertions. The Butler report highlights this failure. So a flawed grand strategy became inflexible and unresponsive.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Once the military intervention was decided, we can only assume that Tony Blair had decided that regime change was the best strategy to reduce threats to UK national interests. Yet again little thought seemed to have been given to coping with less than Utopian outcomes. Toppling Saddam Hussein, symbolised by his falling statue on 9 April, was an efficient&nbsp; and effective military operation against a rag tag Iraqi army. But grand strategy requires leaders to look beyond the immediate military operation. Preparation for post-war Iraq was incompetent.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3><b>Post Conflict Failure</b></h3>
			<p>&nbsp;As we look now at the litany of errors in the months after major combat ended, it is clear that there was no strategic vision for the building of a new Iraq. Much of the blame rightly attaches to the US Administration, who were the leading nation in the coalition. Yet the United Kingdom had sent the largest force it could muster to fight the war alongside the US, and was the next largest troop provider for the post conflict reconstruction period. The need for a British grand strategy does not disappear because we are the junior members of a coalition. The need for a stable, peaceful and prosperous Iraq was more urgent after the intervention than before. Yet the British Government appeared to accept a submissive role in the US-led shaping of policy for Iraq.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>A battle of wills between the State Department and the Pentagon did not help the development of a coherent approach to the occupation of Iraq. Looting of former government buildings was tolerated.&nbsp; Paul Bremer was brought in to replace Jay Garner as the head of the Coalition Provisional Authority in a muddled hand over. He disbanded the Iraqi army and banned members of the Ba'athist Party from jobs. The timetable and schemes for progress to an elected government under a new constitution&nbsp; changed frequently. Internal security&nbsp; for key targets was inadequate, and the UN's Sergio Vieira de Mello was assassinated.&nbsp; Urban counter-insurgency operations were heavy handed and generated more support for militias.&nbsp; The obscene abuse of Iraqi detainees at Abu Graib prison generated more anti-Western feeling. Money allocated to reconstruction work was slow to be committed and slower still to show results. The new Iraqi security forces were barely given any training before being put on the streets.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Eventually, the road map for a new Iraq emerged. Partly determined by the US election timetable, partly by the demands of the majority Shia community, and partly by the increasing need for international help, some power was transferred to the unelected interim government under Prime Minister Alawi on 28 June 2004. The UN agreed the timetable of first elections for a transitional government in January 2005, to be followed by a referendum on a new constitution&nbsp; later in the year, and a full democratic government to be elected by the end of 2005. This scheme is the best hope for success in Iraq, but would have had a much better chance if it had been laid out back on 1 May 2003 when President Bush made his &quot;mission accomplished&quot; speech from an aircraft carrier safely moored off San Diego. Grand strategy would have called for such a vision of political transition, and would have allowed subsequent operations to be shaped to make it work. As it was, a year was lost, and the plan is now much more fragile than it need have been.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>The Way Ahead</h3>
			<p>Do we have a grand strategy now? Tony Blair's wish to put the mistakes of Iraq behind him is scarcely a vision for the nation.&nbsp; It is in the British national interest to see a democratic and prosperous Iraq which has good relations with both its neighbours and with us. It is also important that we reduce the growing support for militant Islamic movements around the world. Our subordinate role in support of the US, both in the rush to intervention&nbsp; and the subsequent mismanagement of the rebuilding of the nation, has made our strategy immeasurably more difficult and costly.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>For the future of Iraq, we need to keep the political process on track and ensure that economic development does not remain stalled. Both require a better security situation.&nbsp; In the short term this may require more international security forces (both police and military), but there must be a clear plan to reduce dependence on outside forces. This means that training and equipping the Iraqi police, border patrol, facilities protection, and other security providers is the highest priority. When the coalition handed over in the&nbsp; middle of 2004, only 5,857 out of 87,000 Iraqi police had been fully trained. 57,000 had received no training at all. Just 255, of the 20,000 border patrol force had received some training.&nbsp; This lack of priority for training is likely to mean that dependence on international forces will be unnecessarily prolonged and counter-productive.</p>
			<p>Perhaps even more important than stabilising Iraq is our need to regain the confidence of the vast majority of the Muslim world. Guantanamo Bay, Abu Graib, Palestine and Iraq are all seen as humiliations by the West, and they increase support for militant extremism. The time is now for a grand strategy to repair relationships. Europe is well placed to develop such a vision given its diverse internal populations as well as historic relations with much of the Muslim world. The test will come soon as Turkey demands an answer over EU membership. It would be better if the decision were made as part of a strategic vision rather than on grubby domestic politics.</p>
