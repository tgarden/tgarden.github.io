			<h3>UK Nuclear Strategy</h3>
			<p>By Sir Timothy Garden</p>
		</div>
		<div align="left">
			<p>After a decade of pushing UK policy on nuclear weapons further back into the shadows, an unfortunate question to Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon has put British nuclear strategy under the international spotlight. During the Cold War the rationale for nuclear capability was relatively easy to describe (even if CND was less than convinced).<br>
				<br>
				Since the end of the Cold War, nuclear strategy has seemed much less important. The five nuclear weapon states have reduced their weapon numbers considerably. Following the break up of the Soviet Union, only Russia retained a nuclear capability among the newly independent republics. The UK has taken all of its nuclear weapons out of service apart from the remaining Trident systems based on 4 submarines. After the Strategic Defence Review (SDR) of 1998, even the numbers of those missiles and warheads per missile were further reduced. <br>
				<br>
				The UK nuclear forces now number 4 submarines each with a maximum of 16 missiles carrying a maximum total of 48 warheads in one submarine. The total warhead stockpile is under 200, which makes the UK the smallest of the five official nuclear weapon states, and it may even have fewer  than Israel. Nevertheless 48 nuclear weapons represents a devastating power. The SDR recognised that this could be inappropriate and hence incredible. It said therefore:<br>
				<br>
				&quot;The credibility of deterrence also depends on retaining an option for a limited strike that would not automatically lead to a full scale nuclear exchange. Unlike Polaris and Chevaline, Trident must also be capable of performing this 'sub-strategic' role. &quot;<br>
				<br>
				What was not explained in any more detail was the thinking behind this sub-strategic task. Presumably it was for occasions when one or two nuclear weapons might be sufficient to show resolve in some unspecified future crisis. However the SDR was quite clear on the circumstances under which UK nuclear weapons could and could not be used. It repeated what is called the Negative Security Assurance, and spelled out what that assurance means:<br>
				<br>
				&quot;Britain has repeatedly made it clear that we will not use nuclear weapons against a non-nuclear weapon state not in material breach of its nuclear non-proliferation obligations, unless it attacks us, our Allies or a state to which we have a security commitment, in association or alliance with a nuclear weapon state. Britain has also undertaken to seek immediate UN Security Council action to assist any non-nuclear-weapon state party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty that is attacked or threatened with nuclear weapons.&quot;<br>
				<br>
				This assurance is designed to act as an encouragement to non nuclear weapon states to stay that way, and is a sensible diplomatic approach to dissuade potential proliferators. That said, like any assurance given in peaceful times, it will probably not be believed by an enemy at times of crisis. Thus Saddam Hussein may have been deterred from using chemical weapons during the Gulf War, because he believed that there was a possibility of western nuclear retaliation. Deterrence can happen without explicit statements.<br>
				<br>
				All of this makes Defence Secretary Hoon's exposition of nuclear strategy over the past week unfortunate. He was asked in the closing minutes of a Defence Select Committee session on missile defence whether our nuclear deterrent mitigated the need for a missile defence system. Instead of giving a short and ambiguous answer, he chose to say:<br>
				<br>
				&quot;.....there are clearly some states who would be deterred by the fact that the United Kingdom possesses nuclear weapons and has the willingness and ability to use them in appropriate circumstances. States of concern, I would be much less confident about, and Saddam Hussein has demonstrated in the past his willingness to use chemical weapons against his own people.. ....They can be absolutely confident that in the right conditions we would be willing to use our nuclear weapons. What I cannot be absolutely confident about is whether that would be sufficient to deter them from using a weapon of mass destruction in the first place.&quot;<br>
				<br>
				 Students of nuclear policy took this as a major change in UK thinking. We were now apparently contemplating the potential use of nuclear weapons against an enemy using chemical weapons. This could run counter to our negative security assurances. It could also be read as a rather loose description of deterrence at the end of a difficult select committee session, when Geoff Hoon's mind may have been focused on the emergency debate on Afghanistan, which was scheduled for later that afternoon. However, four days later on the Jonathan Dimbleby ITV programme, he made his meaning quite clear. He said that, if British troops were threatened by chemical or biological weapons, the UK Government reserved the right to use nuclear weapons. This may give the FCO non proliferation team some difficult explaining to do at their next international meeting. It will be interesting if this new approach appears in the new chapter to the SDR, which the MOD is currently writing.</p>
