<P>The division of armed conflict into categories of terrorism,
guerrilla warfare and conventional warfare is now less useful than
perhaps it was in the past. Indeed definitions of the various classes
of activity vary between commentators, between regions and across
history. Robert Asprey's update of his 1975 book, War in the Shadows,
encompasses a wide definition of the guerrilla. He covers those
conflicts in which the organised forces of a state find themselves
fighting against an enemy which uses unconventional - in traditional
military eyes - tactics. The scale of such an undertaking is
reflected in the size of this work. The 94 chapters run from the
troubles that Darius had with the Scythians in 512 BC through to the
current difficulties with the Tamils in Sri Lanka.  Keeping a sense
of historical perspective across such a period and giving appropriate
relative weight to different campaigns are just two of the problems
in such a vast work. The more recent campaigns are better documented
and unsurprisingly receive fuller treatment. Nevertheless, the detail
of every operation is more than adequate for the interested reader.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>At first sight such a massive work (which the author describes as
"highly abridged") looks as though it would only be of interest as a
reference book. Indeed , with 40 pages of double column index, it
makes a first class database for the student of insurgency. Yet it is
also written in a style which allows the reader to start at the
beginning and remain fascinated until the end. It is a record across
time and space of conflicts which have shaped the world today.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The first part is called "Lenin's Heritage", and takes us from
Persia through Greece and Rome  to conclude with the Russian
Revolution. In the 13th Century AD, we have arrived for our first of
many calls in Vietnam. Asprey describes the Mongol attacks on the
Gulf of Tonkin, and highlights the prescience  of Marshal Tran Hung
Dao who trained a Vietnamese guerrilla force in 1284. Dao wrote: "The
enemy must fight battles far from his home base for a long time .....
We must further weaken him by drawing him into protracted campaigns."
 On that occasion it took the Vietnamese freedom fighters three years
to defeat Kublai Khan. Their techniques were to remain consistent 
and effective over the next 700 years. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The second part, "Mao and Revolutionary Warfare" , takes us from
the Opium Wars to World War II. There are too many fascinating
diversions to list , but my eye was inevitably drawn to a chapter
which included a section on the use of air power for pacification. In
a few pages we are taken through the development by the Royal Air
Force of the use of air power for cost effective Imperial policing
between the wars. The strengths and weaknesses are all covered, as is
the flavour of the inter-Service rivalry of the day. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The third part - although some half of the book - is titled "Ho
... Ho... Ho Chi Minh", and takes us from the beginning of the Cold
War through to Cambodia in 1993. However, most of this section
reflects the author's preoccupation with Vietnam, and in particular
the United States' involvement in the region. There is no doubt that
he feels very strongly about the need for America to learn the
lessons of this war. As he says in his foreword: "The pages that
follow emphasise the cost to any country when its civil and military
leaders fail to consider yesterday while dealing with today". Despite
the strength of his feelings, the descriptions remain factual,
objective and well documented.  </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The final section would make a perfectly satisfactory book on its
own. Some fourteen chapters cover the background to current
insurgency problems. We look here at South America, Northern Ireland,
the Middle East,  Southern Africa, the Kurdish Diaspora,  and South
Asia. Having just returned from Namibia and Mozambique, I tested the
book as one would a reference book before travelling to unusual parts
of the world. Once our traveller remembers that Namibia may appear as
South West Africa, all is well. In a few pages the history of the
country is covered right up to independence. Mozambique is similarly
well described but its story finishes with the round of  peace talks
in July 1992: an indication of the difficulty of keeping every
element of the book up to date. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Asprey explains that he wrote the first edition of War in the
Shadows with intention of explaining the Vietnam War to American
readers in the historical terms of guerrilla warfare. This edition
has a dual aim. First he wanted to update the information on Vietnam
in the light of the mass of evidence which has come to light since he
wrote in the early 70s. Second, he wanted to report on the more
important guerrilla wars of the post-Vietnam period. His foreword
states there are some eighteen countries hosting guerrilla wars, four
countries with uneasy truces, and a further fourteen with the
potential for such conflicts. Curiously, this is distilled into the
book's flyleaf as "thirteen countries currently experiencing
guerrilla warfare". Whether this is a difference of timing,
definition or accuracy between author and publisher is not clear and
does not matter. The increasing incidence of conflict with
non-conventional methods of fighting is apparent for all to see. The
old certainties of conflicts between states using the conventions of
war are giving way to ethnic, religious, tribal and warlord actions.
Coupling these types of conflict to the modern weapons so widely
available gives rise to a developing international problem. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>How might the general reader use this book? It can be an aid to
understanding the new developments on the international scene. To the
British reader, Northern Ireland is likely to be of particular
interest.  To the military man, it is an essential reader in
counter-insurgency. To the policy maker, it is an awful warning of
the need for clear  and sustained aims in any operation against
guerrillas. At &pound;30, this must be the best value book in the
field ever published.</P>
