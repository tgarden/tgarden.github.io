			<h3>China takes on the US</h3>
			<p>By Sir Timothy Garden</p>
		</div>
		<p>It is like a replay of the bad old days of the Cold War. A collision between a US spy plane and a Chinese fighter aircraft ends up with a major diplomatic incident, not to say a Chinese pilot missing presumed dead and the US crew stranded on Chinese territory.<br>
			<br>
			 How did this happen? The US Navy EP-3 is a specially converted maritime reconnaissance aircraft. The normal cameras and radars for spotting ships and submarines are replaced with electromagnetic listening devices to pick up electronic intelligence (ELINT). The crew will include specialists who can analyse air defence radars, data links, radio communications and the hundreds of different ways that the electromagnetic spectrum is used today. Such data is important to build up a picture of other countries&#146; capabilities. It may also be able to indicate changes in operating procedures, new deployments, new weapon systems and even be the first indicator of possible conflict. The US is not alone in fielding such listening intelligence gatherers. Given their interests in Taiwan, it is scarcely surprising that they would deploy such a capability to monitor Chinese military activity.<br>
			<br>
			For the Chinese, it will be a source of irritation that their every signal in the area is being monitored. They will take precautions to ensure that the important data is encrypted, but even the nature and location of the encrypted signal may reveal useful information to the listeners. Just as NATO ships in the Cold War were annoyed by Soviet trawlers gathering intelligence, so the Chinese will wish to hamper these operations. The use of fighter interceptions is one way of both showing annoyance, and also making it more difficult for the EP-3 crew to maintain their surveillance. Both sides will have careful instructions on how far they can go &#150; their rules of engagement. The US Navy aircraft will have kept carefully to international airspace. It is very unlikely that the collision was deliberately caused by either aircraft. Normal interception procedures never use collision as a way to force another aircraft down. Most likely the slow speed of the propeller driven US aircraft made it difficult for the escorting jet fighters to hold position, and the collision resulted from a misjudged manoeuvre. <br>
			<br>
			The events after the collision are scarcely surprising. The Chinese will have looked at the landing of the damaged ultra secret US Navy aircraft on their territory as akin to winning the lottery. Had the positions been reversed, the US would have been very slow to return such an important intelligence prize before it had been thoroughly examined. The Chinese will wish to continue to play the part of those who have been sinned against. They are therefore unlikely to try to extract much information from the 24 aircrew. However, it seems foolish to allow relatives of the hapless crew to explain to the world&#146;s Press how well qualified in languages or cryptography their loved ones are. What will really interest the Chinese technical intelligence community is the equipment and data on board the EP-3. Such a sensitive mission would certainly have standard operating procedures for destruction of classified material. The crew is large enough, and the time before landing was long enough, for those procedures to have been carried out. Despite the announcement from the US that all sensitive material has been destroyed, there will be lingering doubts. These aircraft contain some very expensive toys, and it would require some fairly extreme conditions to use the fire axe to disable the kit. More likely the data would be wiped and cryptographic systems rendered useless. The physical dimensions of aerials and receivers will tell the Chinese experts much about what was being intercepted. They will presumably already have a fairly clear idea. <br>
			<br>
			More interesting than the intelligence gains which China may make is how the diplomatic exchange will pan out. A decision on equipping Taiwan with the most advanced US Aegis air defence ships is currently in George W. Bush&#146;s in-tray. Most believe that, in line with his confrontational policies elsewhere on China, he would be likely to seek Congressional approval for such sales to Taiwan. The Chinese may also have made this assessment, and believe they have little to lose by using the EP-3 and its crew as a bargaining chip. The hot money is on this crisis reinforcing US enthusiasm for the Taiwan arms deal. The megaphone diplomacy that both the US and China are using confirms this analysis. It may be that there is a deal to be had for a quick return of the damaged reconnaissance aircraft and a quiet assurance from Bush on no early upgrade for Taiwan.<br>
			<br>
			If anyone wants a bad night&#146;s sleep, go and see the new film about the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, and imagine how it might have been if George W had been there instead of JFK.<br>
