<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In a new move, that received little
publicity, the EU tasked the UK Defence Select Committee to provide
an opinion on the defence aspects of the Helsinki Summit of last
December. The Defence Committee has worked fast and published its
</FONT><FONT

on 11 May 2000.</A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> Their investigation
had three strands. First they looked at the headline goals from the
Summit, when it was agreed that EU nations would aim to put together
a deployable force of 15 brigades with all the necessary support.
Second they looked at the three new EU security institutions which
were to be established. These were the Political and Security
Committee (PSC) , the Military Committee, and a Military Staff,
within the secretariat of the EU's General Affairs Council (GAC).
Thirdly they considered the arrangements for co-operation between the
EU member states, non-EU European NATO allies and other European
partners; and for EU-NATO co-operation on military crisis management.
Anyone who finds it difficult to distinguish between the Common
European Security and Defence Policy (CESDP), the Common Foreign and
Security Policy (CFSP) and the European Security and Defence Identity
(ESDI) will find this report very helpful.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In coming to their judgements, the Committee
is optimistic about the achievement of the deployable force within
the allowed timescale of 3 years. They rightly point out the greater
difficulties in providing the necessary air, sea, intelligence and
command support to underpin the capability. On the new institutions
they make sensible recommendations about which post should be
double-hatted with NATO appointments, and which require separate EU
leadership. They are also reasonably hopeful that the problems caused
by the difference memberships of the EU and of NATO can be overcome.
In a measured conclusion they say:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">"It suits both the proponents and the
opponents of enhanced European co-operation in security and defence
to overstate the significance of what has happened in this area of
policy over the last eighteen months to two years. Some of those who
oppose the present initiative have expressed concern about possible
future change, rather than present actuality or what is likely to be
realised in the immediately foreseeable future. And while there is an
undoubted case for greater European effort and cohesion in defence,
some of those who express support for the latest initiative
undoubtedly have their own agenda in seeking a diminution of US
involvement and what they see as US domination."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Two other events this month have been
important in the field of European security. The announcement by
Geoff Hoon, the UK Defence Secretary, on two major equipment
procurement programmes, had a very significant European political
dimension. Air Transport has been identified as a key area for
greater EU capability. Unfortunately, there is no immediately
available European solution. Some 10 EU nations operate the C130
tactical air transport aircraft, and the UK is halfway through a
modernisation programme for these aircraft (replacing the old models
with the new C130J). They are too small for some of the larger and
heavier pieces of equipment. In a judgement of Solomon, Geoff Hoon
decided to lease 4 large US C17 aircraft, while making a fairly firm
long term commitment to the Airbus military transport variant, which
still has to be built. This gives a European defence project for EU
states to build a joint capability around. Unfortunately, it will be
a long time coming and is unlikely to offer as much flexibility as
the C17s (or indeed surplus Antonovs). At the same, the Defence
Secretary also announced his backing for a European missile, the
Meteor, for the Eurofighter. This again gives the basis for an EU
Eurofighter force with common equipment. It also requires an act of
faith in terms of capability, cost and delivery date. With budget
pressures on the MOD, it appears that they are prepared to take both
financial and political risk to advance the cause of European
defence.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The third major European defence event has
been the publication in Germany of the results of </FONT><FONT
COLOR="#000000"><A HREF="http://www.bundeswehr.de/ministerium/politik_aktuell/zk-e1.html">the
study into the future of German defence forces</A></FONT><FONT
COLOR="#000000"> . Although it was produced by an independent
commission, it carries considerable weight with the German
government. The headlines have been stolen by the radical proposals
for reducing the conscription element of the German army. Less
noticed, but of more significance to the European defence effort was
a recommendation on pooling forces. They recommend that: "The
multinationalisation of the operational forces should be advanced by
adopting solutions for integration modelled on the NATO Airborne
Early Warning Forces (AWACS) and by pooling the European air and
sealift, reconnaissance and air defence resources." This is a radical
proposal which could make European capabilities much more effective
if it were to be adopted.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The next stage in the process is the
pledging conference hosted by the French in the autumn as part of
their term of EU Presidency. In this process, the Helsinki deployable
force has to be identified, and perhaps most importantly, the gaps in
capability filled. It seems as though Europe might just be serious
about common defence this time.</FONT></P>
