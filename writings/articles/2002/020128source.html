			<h3>Israel-Palestine Crisis Deepens</h3>

			<p>The cycle of violence takes another turn for the worse as each week passes in Israel and the Occupied Territories. The news of a female suicide bomber is the latest twist. Perhaps the most extraordinary aspect of the deepening chaos is the way that the rest of the world is averting is gaze. It is only 18 months ago that peace seemed possible as both Barak and Arafat edged towards a future Palestinian state living in harmony with a secure Israel. When those negotiations are remembered now, it is in order to allocate blame to one side or the other for the breakdown. The cause, real or imagined, is no longer important. After the intensifying guerrilla war by a mixture of pro-Palestinian groups, the Israeli responses become fiercer, more disproportionate and ultimately counter productive. <br>
				<br>
				It looks as though Prime Minister Sharon is pursuing a policy of collective punishment on the Palestine people for each terrorist atrocity. He seems unconcerned by what may happen when Arafat is no longer leader. While, it is likely that there will be an internal struggle for Palestinian leadership, there will almost certainly be a considerable polarisation of moderate Palestinian opinion. CNN pictures leave an image of stone throwing rage when we think of the West Bank and Gaza. The reality is, or at least was, a pleasant easy going society with family based entrepreneurial arab culture. Some bits of the West Bank are more cosmopolitan than others, and you may have to use a taxi to get to a place that serves a decent glass of wine if your hotel is in a 'dry' area. The feeling of tolerance is quite different from the stricter Islamic countries. Yet each F16 or helicopter gunship attack recruits dozens more to the extremist cause. It is possible that Sharon realises this, and hopes it will be easier to displace or corral the Palestinians if he first tars them all with the terrorist brush. This strategy seems to be working with the US administration, who have taken an even harder line after suffering their own suicide terrorist attacks. What seems to be against US strategic interests is the effect that condoning Israeli tough action has on the rest of the Arab world.<br>
				<br>
				The situation becomes more dangerous by the day. Even if Arafat is taken out of the equation, Palestinian territory re-occupied and the Arab population kept under intense military control, the suicide bombing will increase as moderates become extremists. More worrying is what Israel's neighbours may decide to do. Iraq has not given up its quest to lead the region, and this would be a cause around which to rally support. The visit last week by the Iraqi Foreign Minister to Iran may  be an important development. These two long term enemies may be deciding that there is a more important cause which unites them. At the same time the growing spat between the US and Saudi Arabia over military bases could hardly have come at a worse time. <br>
				<br>
				Relationships between the Saudi Arabian government and the USA seem to be in a transition period. The noises from both sides about possible withdrawal of US military presence may be more for domestic consumption than a real prospect. Prince Nawaf, the powerful Saudi head of Intelligence, appeared to confirm, in an interview over the weekend, the Saudi government's desire for the Americans to stay. But he is reported also to have warned the USA not to isolate Yasser Arafat, who he described as a man of peace. He warned that if something were to happen to Arafat, the anti-American feelings in the region would be strengthened. Nawaf made it clear that there was no successor to Arafat who would bring peace. Nor outside the US does the rest of the alliance against terrorism have much love for current Israeli tactics. Indeed Belgium is pursuing the case against Sharon for alleged previous war crimes with great vigour. This bodes ill for strained transatlantic relations if the future of Arafat comes to a crisis point.<br>
				<br>
				The policy options appear limited so long as the US feels it has more important things to do. Tony Blair needs to keep reminding his best pal George Bush that a satisfactory resolution of the Israel/Palestine problem is a key part of the &quot;war on terrorism&quot;. Afghanistan will have been a hollow victory if the fundamentalists are strengthened throughout the region by an unjust settlement for the Palestinians. For Sharon it appears that his approach to Arafat is more personal than strategic. He may be looking to force him back into exile, and hope for a more accommodating successor. Such a policy is as unlikely to succeed. It is time for the EU to produce a robust policy approach. It has the economic levers given its funding of the Palestinian Authority and the trade Israel enjoys with Europe. The threat of sanctions might be a place to start, and the Mitchell plan could form the working agenda. There is no reason why any international force needed could not count as a Petersberg Task for the new EU military capability.</p>
