<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Social responsibility</H1>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>&nbsp;</P>

<P>RTZ-CRA aims to develop the world's natural resources in a
responsible manner for the long term benefit of its shareholders,
employees, customers and the communities and countries in which those
resources are found. It believes that mining should be carried out
with proper concern for the environment, local communities and
employees' health and safety. RTZ-CRA makes a major contribution to
economic prosperity and sustainable growth in the world. The
company's development has been based on a tradition of social
responsibility, contributing to the development and well being of
communities wherever it operates.</P>

<H3>Social responsibility</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Worldwide, RTZ-CRA companies give support directly and through
independently managed foundations.</P>

<P>In 1995 RTZ-CRA invested $17 million worldwide on community
projects, with $4.8 million in Australasia and South East Asia, $5.2
million in Southern Africa, $2.7 million in the UK and a similar
amount in North and South America</P>

<P>Each company determines how the Group's commitment to responsible
corporate citizenship is best suited to local needs and conditions,
working with its neighbours to find appropriate solutions.
Operational management has the knowledge and experience of local
conditions and respect for customs and regulation. Their role is to
enable and facilitate communities to develop self managed and
sustainable projects. Companies are also required to implement
communications programmes to reassure neighbours that operations are
safe and well managed. Honouring responsibilities to employees and
neighbours and playing an active role in the community are integral
to the long term well being of the business. An operation can only
flourish in a stable and prospering society. RTZ-CRA companies
respond to a wide variety of needs through a great diversity of
projects but attention is focused on education, the environment and
community development projects.</P>

<H3>Education</H3>

<P>RTZ-CRA recognises the fundamental importance of education and
worldwide the highest level of investment in both time and money is
in this area. Projects vary but the common aim is to enable
individuals to develop their full potential so that they can enhance
the quality of their lives and fully contribute to their community.
Academic and vocational support spans every facet of the educational
field from pre school to adult education, from basic resources to
university professorships.</P>

<H3>The environment</H3>

<P>RTZ-CRA has long experience in achieving a favourable balance
between the demand for raw materials and conservation of the
environment. It has a reputation for responsible, safe and efficient
operations second to none in the industry. Care for the environment
is considered essential, good business practice and an integral part
of operations.</P>

<P>RTZ-CRA believes that the mining industry must explain that its
vital contribution to economic growth and care for the environment
are interdependent. In addition to achieving high standards of
environmental care and management at their operations, Group
companies support voluntary initiativeswhich conserve and improve the
environment,</P>

<H3>Employment practices</H3>

<P>RTZ-CRA Group companies employ approximately 51,000 worldwide with
around 1,400 employees in the UK and 14,000 in Australia.</P>

<P>Reflecting its overall philosophy of decentralisation, RTZ-CRA
does not impose a uniform policy on employee involvement. However, it
is committed to equality of opportunity and encourages each operating
company to develop its own policies and practices to suit individual
circumstances.</P>

<P>Group companies recognise their obligations to comply with health
and safety legislation and by training and communication encourage
employee awareness of the need to create and secure a safe and
healthy working environment. Management development and succession
planning are reviewed regularly.</P>

<P>Group companies employ disabled people and accept the need to
maintain and develop careers for them. If an employee does become
disabled whilst in employment and, as a result, is unable to perform
his or her duties, every effort is made to offer suitable alternative
employment and to assist with retraining.</P>

<P>Retirement pensions and benefits to dependants are provided by
RTZ-CRA and its major subsidiaries in accordance with local
conditions and good practice in the country concerned.</P>

<H3>Community Development</H3>

<P>Projects to encourage and promote local industry, agriculture and
enterprise give companies long term security and prosperity. Group
companies work with local people to develop skills and small
businesses which help them to achieve independence and fulfil their
potential.</P>
