<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>While it is possible to draw upon thousands of years of the
history of warfare for both land and sea, most of the development of
air warfare has taken place in this century. It is therefore much
more difficult to take the historical perspective as to which
techical developments have been of greatest significance, but there
is no doubt that the aircraft itself has changed the whole nature of
warfare.</P>

<P>The use of balloons as artillery observation posts was well tried
by the end of the 19th Century. They provided convenient 'high
ground' where nature had omitted to fill the military need. Even more
than the naval sail ships, they were at the mercy of the wind and
were normally tethered. It was the technical development which
allowed man to choose his path through the air which was crucial. The
combination of lighter-than-air vehicle with internal combustion
engine and air propeller was the obvious route. Indeed the military
followed this development line with some enthusiasm before World War
One. Looking for more power and greater range increased the engine
and fuel weight, which in turn required ever larger displacements to
support the weight. The potential of the airship was limited by the
laws of physics from the outset. Nevertheless, their range and
payload in the early days of air warfare did contribute to future
strategic thinking. The raids by German Zeppelins in the early part
of the war showed that air power could take the war right back to the
opponent's homeland, which had previously been thouht of as a safe
refuge.</P>

<P>The longer term development of air power was to be through the
heavier-than-air route. Otto Lilienthal developed the glider in the
last quarter of the 19th Century, and from the experience of over
2000 flights was able to point the way towards the design of powered
aircraft. In 1896 an unmanned steam-driven aircraft made a successful
flight, and on 17 December 1903 the Wright brothers demonstrated the
first heavier-than-air powered flying machine controlled by a pilot
(1).</P>

<P>The military potential of machines which have freedom of movement
above the surface of the earth seems self evident now. In the United
States, the War Department was uninterested for the next 3 years. In
Britain, establishment interest was equally dismissive of the
potential of aircraft. A War Office report of 1904 recommended work
only on balloons and airships. Two events, one civil and one
military, changed the general appreciation of the potential of the
implications of the new technology of manned aircraft. On 25 July
1909, Bleriot flew the English Channel and gained worldwide
publicity. The strategic security that Great Britain had enjoyed for
centuries through its navy had been put in jeopardy by a fabric and
piano wire flying machine. Then in 1911, the Italians used their
primitive aircraft in the war in Libya.</P>

<P>The use of aircraft for reconnaissance was rapidly developed, and
great publicity resulted from the first dropping of bombs from over
the side of the aircraft.(2) In Britain, the Prime Minister, Asquith,
was concerned by the great increase in military aircraft activity
overseas, and initiated a study into the implications which brought
about the formation of the Royal Flying Corps in 1912. The lessons
were absorbed at different rates by nations, and surprisingly the
United States was amongst the slowest to invest in this new
technology (3).</P>

<P>Britain had 63 aircraft in August 1914, yet by 1918 was producing
2000 machines every month. Military technological development
accelerates rapidly under the pressure of national survival.
Certainly, developments in mass production techniques were a crucial
element in many areas of wartime production in 1914-1918. There were
considerable problems in developing both roles and equipment at a
time of total war, and meeting an enormous production requirement.
Many of the modern roles of air power had been demonstrated before
the war started. Torpedoes had been dropped from aircraft in 1911,
and they were tested for anti-submarine operations the following
year. Even deck operations from a cruiser had been tested. At the
start of what was initially a land war, the role of the few aircraft
involved was seen as reconnaissance, although there were still
Generals who felt this was better left to the cavalry. The fighter
and the bomber were both important developments during the war. The
key to the fighter was the requirement for forward facing machine
guns, while for the bomber is was accurate navigation and bombsights.
</P>

<P>In the same way that the components for the tank were available
some time before the necessary imagination to assemble them, the
fighter had to wait for the interruptor mechanism that coupled the
machine gun to the aircraft. Once air-to-air combat became possible,
the priority was for greater power and speed, and more firepower. The
same qualities were needed for the bombers, looking for range and
payload. The raids on London by German Gothas in mid 1917 were to
shape strategic thinking for the inter-war period. The power to bring
a war to the home population through strategic bombing was a new
element in warfare. The effect on civilian morale of a single raid by
21 aircraft on 7 July 1917, dropping some 3 tons of bombs on London
and killing 60 people, was extreme. The effect on strategic thinking,
and hence on priorities for development of airpower over the next 20
years was profound. Strategists such as Douhet were already 'proving'
that the bomber was the ultimate future weapon, and that wars could
be won without the intervention of ground forces.(4).</P>

<P>In fact there were many examples of the way in which air power
could contribute to victory which were far more significant than the
relatively small scale strategic raids. When the aircraft used were
fully integrated with the ground forces' plans, through the
co-ordinated use of reconnaissance, fire support, air defence and
logistic resupply, great results could be achieved by relatively weak
forces. The Palestine campaign at the end of World War 1 was a prime
example of such a use of the new capabilities which airpower offered
(5). In that war, it appeared that proper exploitation of the
technology was best achieved when far away from the military
leadership in Europe.</P>

<P>Military airpower went into a severe decline in the 1920's. It was
expensive in capital equipment, and required highly trained aircrew.
It also lacked the strong lobby which ground and naval forces enjoyed
in most countries. Indeed the establishment of a separate military
arm to run air warfare was by no means universally accepted. At the
end of the war, the RAF in Britain had some 22,647 aircraft, and
could produce new machines at the rate of 3500 per month. The
war-winning technology was as much that of mass production, as that
of any special weapon system. While the strategists could call for
greater priority to aircraft development, nations were unwilling to
divert resources to military machinery after the war to end all wars.
</P>

<P>Technology for new military aircraft came not from the carefully
researched concepts for future wars, but from more ordinary
considerations. The development of worldwide civil air travel forced
the pace on aircraft design for long range, and new navigation
systems. The search for higher speeds in air races, such as the
Schneider trophy races of 1927-31, improved engine and airframe
performances. It was the mid 30's before the all metal monoplane
became the norm. Mitchell in the USA tried to demonstrate the
vulnerability of naval vessels to properly used air-delivered
weapons. However, the US Navy did begin to appreciate the importance
of having their own air arm, and developing carrier born forces. The
future of airships seemed to come to an end in this era following the
R-101 and Hindenburg disasters. By the start of World War 2, it
appeared that twenty years of possible technical advance had been
lost for miltary aircraft. The advances had come from civil aircraft
design, improved engines, better mass- production techniques, and a
better understanding of aerodynmics. Communications through radio
were by now universal.</P>

<P>In one area of technology advance, military research was beginning
to come to fruition. In 1935, Watson-Watt in England demonstrated the
first successful aircraft detection system based on radar. Hertz had
shown in 1887, that radio waves could be reflected from solid
objects. It had taken nearly 50 years for this amusing scientific
novelty, to be translated in great secrecy to a crucial military
breakthrough. Even in this case the military application stemmed from
a Post Office report of 1932 about aircraft interfering with radio
signals (6). Other nations were also working on parallel
developments, but possession by Britain gave a significant advantage
in the air defence of the country in the early stages of the war.
Once the principle was demonstrated, radar was developed in many
different ways. Higher frequencies gave greater resolution, higher
power to get longer range, smaller equipment to fit in aircraft to
spot ships and submarines on the surface. Airborne radar could be
used for navigation, which improved bombing accuracy, and allowed
bombing in all weathers and at night.</P>

<P>The development of radar spawned a series of countermeasures in
the form of jamming and dipole metallic strips (chaff) to prevent the
target from being seen. Radar was a technical surprise of an
importance comparable to the submarine, or the tank. It permitted the
aircraft to be used as an effective air defence weapon, preventing
the bomber from getting to its target. The application of science to
produce military radar parallels the development of atomic weapons.
The physical principle on which it was based was well understood, and
freely available in textbooks. It took the insight to see the
military application, coupled with the stimulus of a threat - in this
case the strategic bomber threat - to produce a research project
which could demonstrate its practicality.</P>

<P>World War 2 provided the impetus for many technical improvements
to military aircraft. The bomber needed to be able to navigate
accurately to the target without visual reference, and without giving
its position away to enemy air defences. Radio navigation aids such
as Loran provided this capability. Bomb aiming needed to be improved
through new bombsights, which coupled the benefits of improved
navigation, radar and ballistic calculations to reduce the errors.
Bombs became bigger as bombers grew larger and heavier to carry all
the equipment and self-defensive weapons. The bigger aircraft could
no longer operate from grass fields, but needed concrete runways.
Thus the technology which brought more effective bombers into being,
also brought a new dependence on fixed runways, which in turn became
attractive targets for attack.</P>

<P>Fighters fitted with their own air interception radar became
available from the end of 1940 onwards, and could operate effectively
by night. The fighter's weapon remained the gun, but range and
firepower increased as engine performance improved. Speed, rate of
climb and maximum altitude all benefited from the spur which combat
gave to technical progress. For air defence,the coupling of radar and
anti-aircraft gun systems provided a potent combination. The problems
of identification of friendly aircraft increased as air defence
weapons became more capable. Again radar technology could provide an
answer.</P>

<P>At sea, air power could be used either from land bases or from
increasing numbers of aircraft carriers. The importance of the
carrier to naval forces was considered in Chapter 2. Aircraft allowed
firepower to be delivered at ranges far beyond earlier experience of
navies. The submarine remained a difficult target, and highlighted
the importance of intelligence. Indeed the work of those engaged on
code breaking was every bit as important as the new detection systems
which were becoming available in the war against submarines. (7)</P>

<P>Towards the end of the war, there were three technological
developments which were profoundly to affect air power thinking in
the post war era: the missile, the atomic bomb and the jet engine.
Germany had developed two unmanned long range bombers. The V-1 was a
small aircraft launched by a catapult system, powered by a pulse-jet,
and guided by a gyro compass system. By designing it for a single
one-way mission, no fuel for the return was needed, no aircrew had to
be carried, and the ratio of warhead to overall weight was increased
dramatically. The loss of self defence capability, and inability to
carry out target identification reduced the effectiveness of the
weapon system. The V-2 ballistic missile overcame the vulnerability
problem of the air-breathing V-1. Small unguided rockets had been
developed during the war for air- to-air, anti-tank, artillery and
anti-submarine use. The V- 2 was a quite different weapon. It weighed
28,504 lbs at launch including a one ton warhead. All the fuel was
carried internally, and it was fired to an unprecedented altitude of
some 70 miles before descending ballistically towards its target. The
maximum horizontal range was 200 miles, and its velocity at target
was 3,500 miles per hour (8). Here was a weapon so novel in its
flight envelope that the air defences were totally impotent against
it. The new technology carried penalties. Guidance was difficult, and
small errors during the early powered stage, led to large
inaccuracies at the target. The high terminal velocity reduced
effectiveness by burying the warhead too deeply. Nevertheless the V-2
pointed the way to the missile age which was to come. T</P>

<P>he second technological breakthrough to affect the future of air
power was the production of a working atomic bomb. The use of air
delivered atomic weapons at Hiroshima and Nagasaki made the strategic
nuclear bomber the centrepiece of air forces' post war development.
The weight and size of the early atomic bombs made it difficult to
imagine them being delivered by anything but the most powerful
aircraft.</P>

<P>The third technological advance offered increases in power, speed
and altitude through a new power source: the jet engine. So long as
aircraft propulsion depended on the propeller, the aircraft would be
limited by the tip speed of the blades. The principle of the jet
engine was not new. A patent for a gas turbine had been issued in
1791. However it took developments in materials to provide components
which could be machined with precision and yet withstand the very
high temperatures and stresses. The Whittle patent for a gas turbine
aircraft engine was published in 1930. Yet the subsequent development
was remarkably slow. The first jet aircraft, the Heinkel He 176 flew
in 1939, yet it was 1944 before the first jet fighters were used in
combat. As the power available from jet engines has increased, and
designers have sought greater performance from aircraft, the
manufacturing tolerances of every part have become more critical.
Greater understanding of aerodynamics has improved performance yet
further. The sound barrier proved to be conquerable and supersonic
aircraft developed. The penalty associated with increased performance
was one of cost and fuel consumption.</P>

<P>In looking at the development of aerospace power since 1945, it is
possible to argue that there have been enormous technological
advances, which were impossible to foresee, yet at the same time the
application of technology to countermeasures has negated many of the
enhancements. The one result from technological progress has been
rapidly increasing unit costs of aircraft. Considering each of the
roles which air power plays in modern warfare, it is possible to
determine where technology has significantly enhanced capability.
</P>

<P>The earliest use of the air was for reconnaissance and that
remains a vital part of military capability today. The jet aircraft
allowed higher altitudes to give greater coverage, and slant viewing
from safe territory. The vulnerability of high flying aircraft to
modern air defence systems has reduced the effectiveness of such
aircraft near hostile airspace, but they may be the only method of
obtaining rapid large scale survey information. This strategic
reconnaissance can also be obtained from satellite based systems. The
successful placing into orbit of Sputnik 1 in 1957, heralded a
technological development which has had many implications for future
wars. The reconnaissance information available from the wide range of
sensors in space provides much better overall coverage than would be
available from aircraft. There still remains an important role for
the reconnaissance aircraft when specific areas need to be studied,
and also in the tactical situation. In the latter, the aircraft is
likely to be flying at very low level, at high subsonic speed, and
using visual, infra-red and radar sensors. In this respect it is an
evolutionary development from the photo-recce aircraft of the last
war. There are however two forms of air reconnaissance which
represent significant new military capabilities. The first is the
airborne early warning aircraft carrying powerful radar systems, and
the associated data processing capability which allows it to act as a
flying radar station which can control an air battle. The second is
the parallel surveillance system for providing real time detailed
information for the land battle. The Joint Surveillance Target Attack
System (JSTARS) can locate moving ground targets up to 100 miles
away.</P>

<P>The bomber has also evolved in the intervening years. The
evolution has not been as dramatic as is characterised by the high
technology appearance of the modern supersonic bomber. While high
speed and high altitude seemed important qualities in the early days
of the nuclear jet aircraft, air defences for a long time forced the
bomber to plan on very low level operations. The problems of terrain
avoidance and fuel consumption at these heights have effectively
limited speeds to the high subsonic region. A comparison between the
Lancaster bomber of World War 2, and today's Tornado is illuminating.
The Lancaster flying at medium altitude could carry much the same
bomb load over nearly twice the distance as the Tornado, which flies
at just over twice the speed on an operational sortie. It took a crew
of 7 to operate the Lancaster, against the Tornado's two man team,
and it cost just &#163;45,000 in 1945. Taking normal price inflation
into account, a Tornado would cost cost 25 times the 1996 cost of a
Lancaster. This crude comparison of speed, bomb load and combat
radius hides the transformation in the operational environment over
the 40 years. The Lancaster could not reach the target against the
modern air defence systems, and the high cost of the modern offensive
aircraft reflects the necessity of the technological fixes to improve
its survivability. The technology increases effectiveness as well
through all weather operation and greater accuracy of weapon
delivery. The price of this technology reduces the total number of
aircraft available. The balance between these two factors will
determine whether offensive air power is of increasing or diminishing
importance in future wars. The newest United States bombers have
focused their technological development on reducing visibility to
radar. The use of stealth techniques in materials and shape have
multiplied the cost factor yet again.</P>

<P><BR>

One area in offensive air operations, where technology has been
relatively slow to provide new capabilities has been in the weapons
themselves. Conventional bombs have developed relatively slowly. The
major thrust has been towards greater delivery accuracy through some
form of guidance. Laser target marking has allowed precision bombing,
when conditions permit the designation of the target. Design of bombs
specific to targets has been slow in coming, but a range of
specialist munitions are now entering service. The unit costs of such
weapons are significantly greater than those of the dumb iron bombs.
The Gulf War of 1991 saw the use of airfield-denial weapons,
anti-radiation missiles, laser-guided precision bombs, and
air-launched cruise missiles with precision target finding systems.
</P>

<P>The primacy of the strategic bomber for nuclear deterrence was
lost in the 60's as the ballistic missile became a much more certain
way of delivering nuclear weapons to strategic targets. The coupling
of nuclear weapons to ballistic missiles has been the major
technological achievement of the post-war era. Mutual deterrence
depends on an assured nuclear retaliatory capability, and the wide
variety of nuclear systems available provided this. The development
of multiple warheads for these missiles, different basing methods,
and cruise as well as ballistic delivery, made the retaliatory
capability even more assured and reinforced deterrence. Guidance
systems have improved to the extent that singular military targets
can be held at risk as well as area economic targets. As the world
moves away from the nuclear confrontation of the Cold War, there is a
decline in interest in nuclear weapons for aircraft delivery.</P>

<P>Moving to air defence, the development of the air defence missile
has transfomed the way in which aircraft must operate. Missiles can
be guided visually, by radar and through heat seeking sensors. All
these guidance systems work in straight lines, and if located on the
ground will have a minimum effective altitude. This gives a higher
chance of survivability to the low flying aircraft, although they
will remain vulnerable to modern fighters looking down on them. An
alternative countermeasure is to fool the air defence sensor system
through jamming or deception. The developments in electronics have
made this an area of much greater importance in modern warfare.
Fighters have changed significantly in effectiveness: from the guns
operating at close range of 1940, the modern fighter need never see
its target. Long range radar allows an enemy aircraft to be destroyed
with air-to-air missiles at extended ranges. More than one target can
be engaged simultaneously, and the fighter can remain on airborne
alert for long periods through air-to-air refuelling. The real cost
of the modern fighter has increased by even more than the bomber. The
increased capability to defend against enemy aircraft is limited by
the difficulties in positively identifying distant targets as hostile
or friendly. Technology has yet to provide a satisfactory unambiguous
solution to this problem.</P>

<P>The post-war period has seen technology enhancing the ability for
offensive aircraft to penetrate to their targets, and at the same
time for defensive systems to prevent that penetration. The consensus
view appears to be that the defensive systems are winning in this
technological battle. Future aircraft are unlikely to be able to
penetrate close to heavily defended targets, and will depend
increasingly on weapons which can be fired at a distance from the
target.</P>

<P>Looking next at the developments in air transport, the first major
crisis after the War showed through the Berlin airlift the strategic
nature of massive airlift capability. Almost without noticing, the
comparatively lower technology of the transport aircraft has brought
a new concept to military force. Governments have been able to shape
defence policies around their ability to deploy forces by air to
remote trouble spots. The large carrying capability, coupled with in
flight refuelling, has made reinforcement over thousands of miles
possible in a matter of hours. For many operations, the provision of
air transport is seen by Governments as their major contribution. The
operation to feed starving Kurds from the north of Iraq immediately
after the Gulf War required extensive air transport. Supplying
Sarajevo following the break up of Yugoslavia was an air lift
operation to bring back memories of the Berlin air lift.</P>

<P>Maritime aircraft have benefited from the improvements in
navigation equipment, carrying capability, range and stand off weapon
systems. In terms of a breakthrough in ability to detect and destroy
submarines, the process remains as much an art as a science.
Technology has provided novel aids which can detect magnetic
anomalies, relay acoustic information, and enhance all the sensor
information, collate it and display it. The submarine which wishes to
stay hidden still has the advantage.</P>

<P>In aircraft design a major change has been the move away from
dependence on increasingly vulnerable runways. As aircraft became
bigger and more complex, they became more demanding in their
requirements for prepared take off and landing surfaces. This made
airfields attractive targets to reduce enemy air effort. In many
cases airfields may not be conveniently located. Two developments
have made certain aspects of air power independent of runways. The
first was the helicopter. First used in the Korean War, it was a
rescue and medical evacuation vehicle. Experience in the Vietnam War
showed how versatile the helicopter could be for reconnaissance,
command and control, transport, and as a firepower platform.
Helicopters are now fitted with a range of armament for close air
support roles, and have a rapidly growing place in nations'
inventories. Technology has improved the lift capability, the
handling characteristics and the weapons available. The vulnerability
of a relatively slow moving and fragile aircraft remains a problem.
Nevertheless, there are those who would argue that the armed
helicopter is the tank's successor, and the cargo helicopter can
replace the armoured personnel carrier. This would make the ground
forces more mobile, and less easy to obstruct. A judgement of whether
cost and vulnerability will be the limiting factors will have to
await more combat experience.</P>

<P>The second method of removing dependence on runways has been the
development of fixed wing aircraft with vertical take-off and landing
(VTOL) capability. What at first seemed an innovation of limited
application has now been proved through the contribution the Harrier
was able to make in the Falklands Conflict of 1982. The flexibility
offered by such a high performance aircraft operating from dispersed
field sites, or from small ships, has not been taken up as widely as
might have been expected. There are logistic support and aircraft
performance penalties associated with VTOL operations. However under
some circumstances it may be the only way of operating.</P>

<P>For military vehicles operating in the earth's atmosphere, there
have been surprisingly few major changes in concepts since World War
2. The advent of the air defence missile, has forced the pace of
countermeasures. Aircraft fly lower and faster, but no further than
before. The maximum possible speeds and altitudes are no longer
sought after. While demands for operating bases grew more stringent
initially as aircraft became more complex, technology has been moving
towards reducing such dependence. Apart from helicopter operations,
concepts for the use of air power today are not very different from
those of 40 years ago. Technology has improved capabilities, but the
battle remains the same.</P>

<P>Since 1957, the regions beyond the Earth's atmosphere have assumed
increasing importance to national security. Technology has made Space
the extended battlefield. The military uses of Space have developed
at a remarkably slow pace. While larger payloads have been placed in
orbit, and modern electronics and computer technology allows much
more capability to be given to any payload, the costs of Space
systems remain extraordinarily high. In the first 3 decades of this
century aircraft moved from the Wright Flyer to a worldwide use of
aircraft for offensive, defensive, reconnaissance and transport. In
the 40 years since Sputnik 1 was placed in orbit, progress has been
much less dramatic. The use of satellites has assumed increasing
importance for reconnaissance, communication, and navigation. The
ability to launch such systems remains in the hands of very few
nations.</P>

<P>Military reconnaissance satellites are used for photographic
survey, electronic information gathering, missile early warning,
meteorological data gathering and for geodetic measurements for
missile targeting. These all represent quite new capabilities in
scale of information which can be collected. Military communications
are becoming increasingly dependent on satellite relay, although it
was of note that in Bosnia in 1995 the Press had more efficient
satellite communications than the UN forces. While long range
communication has been possible through HF radio, propagation has at
times been unpredictable and data density was limited. Communications
satellites offer comprehensive high density communications over very
great distances,and allow control to be retained at much higher
levels than before. Satellite based navigation systems allow military
systems to fix their positions to unprecedented degrees of accuracy,
with significant implications for weapon delivery accuracies.</P>

<P>In these ways space technology has added to military capabilty.
The cost of the systems is high, and the reliability of launch
systems remains less than perfect. Satellites coul be extremely
vulnerable to a number of countermeasures. By their nature they are
in exposed positions, which are easily located. The then Soviet Union
tested an anti-satellite weapon system based on an exploding
satellite. The USA developed an anti- satellite missile. The UK was
reported in 1995 to have conducted tests aon interference with GPS
signals. Some reconnaissance sensors may be possible to damage by
high energy laser directed at them from the earth. Technology has
provided at a high cost space-based systems which become increasingly
relied upon for command, control, communication and information. Yet
the capability is also a vulnerability if anti-satellite systems are
being developed. The further potential for the military uses of space
are explored in Chapter 8.</P>

<P>Since the beginning of the twentieth century technology has made
air power, and latterly aerospace power, of increasing importance.
The ability to move away from the restrictions of movement on the
Earth's surface offers a new arena for military conflict. The lessons
of the past suggest that our predecessors found it difficult to make
the right development decisions in a timely way. Extrapolations of
limited combat data resulted in false strategic concepts. With the
benefit of hindsight, the technological developments which have
crucially affected aerospace warfare are the invention of the
aircraft, radar, nuclear weapons, and the missile. It may be that the
future historian will place the helicopter/VTOL aircraft, or
satellites among these milestones. Alternatively their vulnerability
may mark them down with the airships of the past.</P>

<P>The characteristics of the four major technological areas may give
some direction to thinking about future possibilities. The aircraft
offered a new scale for firepower in both range of action and speed
of reaction. It gave a new flexibility to the use of military force,
which could be applied to a whole range of widely separated targets.
Radar made the invisible visible. The vast regions of the sky or the
sea could be explored at the speed of light, and appropriate
countermeasures taken. Nuclear weapons provide destructive power on a
scale unimagined before. Indeed with thermonuclear weapons, the
energy released was virtually unlimited. The potential damage from
even a single weapon changed the whole nature of international
relations. Finally the missile provided an unstoppable delivery
method for the nuclear weapon. As we examine the opportunities for
the future, the relative effectiveness of the manned aircraft against
the missile will need close scrutiny. The future applications of
space technology will also need to be examined. Aerospace technology
grows ever more expensive, and yet concepts have not made dramatic
changes in recent times.</P>
