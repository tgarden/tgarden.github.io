<H4><FONT COLOR="#000000">Introduction</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The question that I have been set is "Can
NATO afford to modernize its airlift assets?". The direct answer to
this is quite easy. Of course it can. We are talking about 19 of the
richest nations in the world, and if they wanted to they could up
their spending across the board on defence. The real questions are
whether they have any political will so to do, whether their current
plans are realistic and affordable, and what do they see as the
priorities within their defence budgets. You will doubtless hear from
a number of the industrial presentations later at this conference of
the various orders for new aircraft, and I shall only deal with those
in brief. What I would like to do is concentrate on what is going on
in Europe and how that will affect the airlift available in future
for NATO and other international operations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">It has been an exciting couple of years for
defence thinking in Europe, and the interlinked threads are slightly
complex. I will talk about the work that the European Union has been
doing on capabilities as well as the work that has flowed from the
NATO Defence Capabilities Initiative. Cross cutting both of these has
been the operational experience of Kosovo and other recent UN
operations. To add to the complexity, the European industries have
been reconfiguring themselves, and influencing the political
requirements in the defence procurement field.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT COLOR="#000000">Where is Europe going?</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">We cannot discuss European contributions to
NATO future forces without considering for a moment the relationship
between NATO and the European Union. To remind you, the two
organisations are not entirely overlapping in their membership. This
is important when we look at how capabilities will fit together. NATO
has 19 members, and there is an expectation that it will continue to
enlarge with new European members over the coming years. Of those 19,
the US, Canada, Iceland, Turkey, Norway,Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic are not members of the European Union. The European Union
has 15 members and it also expects to enlarge over the coming years
to perhaps twice as many member states. Of the current EU members,
Austria, Finland, Ireland and Sweden are not members of NATO, and of
course France remains outside the integrated military structure of
NATO. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The EU has grown over the years from a free
market area, like NAFTA, into much more. It has had an intention for
some time to develop a common foreign and security policy. The events
of the last two years have accelerated the work in this area, and
have important implications for the contribution that Europe can make
to defence. There is no doubt that immediately after the end of the
Cold War there was little coherent thought or European agreement on
what military capabilities would be needed in future. Nations cut
their forces by about a third, and took what financial savings they
could. The Gulf War, the subsequent experiences in the North and
South of Iraq, Bosnia, Somalia, Rwanda, Albania, and then Kosovo,
Sierra Leone and East Timor have reminded the European nations that
they have a role to play. Sometimes it will be under a UN flag,
sometimes NATO, sometimes the EU and sometimes an ad hoc coalition of
two or more states. We see the latter in the US/UK force for Desert
Fox and the continuing operations over Iraq. The important thing is
that European states have realised that they will have a need to
carry out military activity beyond just the territorial defence that
most were focused on within NATO throughout the Cold War.
Unfortunately, they have lost a lot of time in the last 10 years when
they should have been reshaping their forces for these new roles, and
they have allowed budgets to decline markedly. The UK has taken a
lead in the reshaping, and is generally credited with doing well in
its Strategic Defence Review of 1998 towards a model of the new sorts
of capabilities which will be needed. That review took airlifty
modernisation as an urgent need. The French followed with their
review on similar lines, as they move from the draft to an all
professional force. Germany has had much greater difficulty for a
number of good reasons. It had both the cost and the impact of
reunification. It had constitutional difficulties with moving to
operations other than defence of its own territory, and it has a
great attachment to conscription as a nation buiding activity.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Let me run through some of the key
milestones in the changes in thinking, and then try to assess whether
the new plans will work, and if so when?</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT COLOR="#000000">NATO Summit</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The NATO 50th anniversary summit of April
1999 should have been a celebration of half a century of keeping the
peace, and a welcome to the 3 new members. Of course it was all of
that, but it also took place at a time when NATO found itself at war
for the first time in its history. Not only at war, but in a war that
had not been authorised directly by the United Nations, was not about
territorial defence, but was a humanitarian intervention. This new
role for NATO had been much discussed in the run up to the new
Strategic Concept, which was to be launched at the Summit, and its
fair to say that not all European NATO members were supportive of
such an extended concept in the early days. Kosovo has chanhged all
that. The shape of forces for power projection require different
capabilities (or different emphasis) than those for static defence.
Europe was organised for a defensive battle, ready to fight where it
stood. The new tasks required an ability to deploy rapidly to trouble
areas and sustain operations for many months. It was scarcely
surprising that NATO found it was short of many of the assets it
would need. The Defence Capabilities Initiative listed the
shortfalls, and all the member nations signed up to rectifying them.
Airlift is of course at the heart of any rapid deployment capability,
and both strategic and tactical airlift enhancements were
needed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The new NATO Strategic Concept recognised
the changes in the strategic environment since the 1991 NATO
Strategic Concept was produced. Many of the elements were directly
relevant to the need to reshape European defence capabilities. In
particular:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">-- Military Capabilities: The
Concept reaffirms Allies' determination to strengthen Alliance
defence capabilities by ensuring forces thatare more mobile,
sustainable, survivable and able to engage effectively on the full
spectrum of NATO missions.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">-- New Missions: The Concept
calls for improvements in NATO's capability to undertake new missions
to respond to a broad spectrum of possible threats to Alliance common
interests, including: regional conflicts, such as in Kosovo and
Bosnia; the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their
means of delivery; and transnational threats like terrorism.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">-- European Capabilities: The Concept
highlights development of a European Security and Defence Identity
within NATO as an essential element of NATO's ongoing adaptation,
enabling European allies to make a more effective contribution to
Euro-Atlantic security.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">This last bullet of the Strategic Concept
recognised the work that been going on in parallel to develop a more
coherent EU approach to foreign and security policy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT COLOR="#000000">Helsinki Proposals</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The development of a coherent defence policy
for the EU had been an area of great difficulty for most of the 90's.
The UK had been particularly unhelpful, fearing that any enhancement
of the EU's role would be at the expense of NATO cohesion. The logjam
was broken by the Anglo-French summit at St Malo in December 1998.
The St Malo Declaration made it clear that: "the Union must have the
capacity for autonomous action, backed up by credible military
forces, the means to decide to use them, and a readiness to do so, in
order to respond to international crises" . This was a radical change
of position for the British and opened the way to the further
developments in 1999 in European defence. The Cologne European
Council Declaration committed all 15 members in paragraph 2:</FONT>
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">"to further develop more
effective European military capabilities from the basis of existing
national, bi-national and multinational capabilities and to
strengthen our own capabilities for that purpose. This requires the
maintenance of a sustained defence effort, the implementation of the
necessary adaptations and notably the reinforcement of our
capabilities in the field of intelligence, strategic transport,
command and control." </FONT></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">All this work was brought together at the EU
Summit in Helsinki on 10/11 December 1999. To develop European
capabilities, Member States have set themselves the headline goal: by
the year 2003, cooperating together voluntarily, they will be able to
deploy rapidly and then sustain forces capable of the full range of
Petersberg tasks as set out in the Amsterdam Treaty, including the
most demanding, in operations up to corps level (up to 15 brigades or
50,000-60,000 persons). These forces should be militarily
self-sustaining with the necessary command, control and intelligence
capabilities, logistics, other combat support services and
additionally, as appropriate, air and naval elements. Member States
should be able to deploy in full at this level within 60 days, and
within this to provide smaller rapid response elements available and
deployable at very high readiness. They must be able to sustain such
a deployment for at least one year. This will require an additional
pool of deployable units (and supporting elements) at lower readiness
to provide replacements for the initial forces.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Member States have also decided to develop
rapidly collective capability goals in the fields of command and
control, intelligence and strategic transport, areas also identified
by the WEU audit. The declaration included a specific welcome for the
establishment of a European air transport command.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">We have now, in theory, an outline plan for
progress in improving European defence capabilities in a way which
works with the grain of NATO. That is a remarkable step forward given
the reluctance of the US and the UK in past years to address these
issues. But there are many difficulties ahead. NATO would claim to
have a planning process, and to have expended much effort over the
years on coercing nations into setting more challenging force goals
for themselves. In practice, the achievement of the process has been
limited, particularly in the past decade. The institutional
arrangements will almost certainly delay the development of the
agreed capability. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Just three weeks ago, the EU nations met to
pledge their contributions to this force, and interestingly most of
the non EU NATO nations and non NATO EU nations were there with
offers as well. It is all some way from reality, but it has helped
the political will to do something about defence. It looks now as
though 11 of the 15 EU nations will increase their defence
expenditure (albeit marginally) in the next year. The focus in the
press has tended to be on numbers of ground troops to be committed.
However, there is a strong realisation of the importance of the air
component of these new forces.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT COLOR="#000000">Lessons of Kosovo/Mozambique/Sierra
Leone/East Timor </FONT></H4>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The 1999 Kosovo air campaign brought
together all the political and military lessons that had been learned
in the post Cold War operations. I do not have to rehearse the
statistics about relative US and European capabilities and
contributions to this audience. The US provided 70% of the total
aircraft and 80% of the total weapons delivered . Europe was shown to
be good at providing political support for the operation, but poorly
equipped to contribute to an offensive air campaign in an effective
way. The lesson of what this meant for influence was not lost on the
European political leadership. The subsequent humanitarian and
peacekeeping operations in Mozambique, Sierra Leone and East Timor
have all shown the need for strategic airlift capability.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT COLOR="#000000">European Budgets</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Why is Europe in this parlous state? First
and most obviously is the relative spending on defence. The United
States Defence budget for 1998 was $267 bn from a GDP of $8.1 tr. Out
of almost exactly the same total GDP, the EU nations together spent
some $173bn on defence or 64% of the US total. The figures are even
worse now given the $/Euro exchange rate.The US fields some 1.4
million professional forces and almost as many ready reserves. The EU
runs 1.8 million troops of which 700,000 are conscripts and retains
3.6 million reservists at various stages of readiness. These raw
budget and personnel statistics show clearly why Europe is so far
behind the US in its military hardware development. Europe fields
more full time troops, and very many more reservists, than the United
States, yet spends only half as much on defence. It is spending its
money on troops for a defensive war rather than on air power to meet
the new challenges. </FONT></P>

<H4><FONT COLOR="#000000">European forces and plans</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Using the Kosovo campaign as a benchmark for
a modern military operation which should be within the capability of
European nations, we can break out the scale of effort that might be
needed in future. The campaign needed to be able to call upon the
traditional mix of air defence fighters, bombers, close air support,
reconnaissance, airborne early warning, air-to-air refuelling,
strategic airlift, tactical fixed wing and rotary transport
capabilities. Although the maritime aspects of the operation were
limited, it must be assumed that some future campaigns might need the
appropriate mix of maritime reconnaissance, air defence, attack and
anti-submarine warfare air assets. Discussion of Helsinki has focused
on the troop requirements, but it is these air power needs which will
pose the greatest challenges.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The EU nations together have elements of all
of these air power capabilities. They field some 3235 combat aircraft
with a total air force manpower of 380,000. If the NATO non-EU
members are added (Czech Republic, Hungary, Iceland, Norway, Poland
and Turkey) the numbers rise to 4281 combat aircraft and 530,000 men.
These large air power assets are however balanced to provide the
defensive posture that was appropriate to the static defence
requirements of the Cold War. They are also, in many cases, managed
in such small packets as to be infefficient. All forces have a strong
air defence element reflecting the requirement to defend their own
territory. While many of the fighters can be used in a bombing role,
they are not all weather capable and aircrew will not have undertaken
primary training in this role. For offensive air operations, the only
EU nations with a significant primary capability are France, Germany,
Italy and the UK, who can field around 500 aircraft in an all weather
bombing mode. Looking at the scale of offensive air capability needed
for the Gulf and Kosovo, Europe needs to work at providing perhaps
50% more all weather bombers than it can at present. France and the
UK with post Colonial legacies have some strategic lift, but other
European nations have nort seen the need for it, or the tanker
support to extend the range of operations. This is all changing and
Germany is in the lead with proposals for a European strategic
airlift force.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Seven countries of the EU are looking to
procure (what look like rather optimistic figures) up to 288 A400M to
meet this new strategic airlift requirement. The aircraft is still a
long way away from production, and it will be probably another 10 ten
years before we see this force in significant numbers. The UK did not
feel that it could wait that long, and has leased 4 C17s from Boeing
(delivered into service in May 2001) in the interim and continued the
replacement of half its C130 fleet with 25 new C130Js. In practice it
has been necessary to lease Antonovs on a number of occasions for
short notice tasks. In very rough terms we might size these aircraft
on the basis of of C130 equivalents. The A400M will be worth two
C130s, the C17 is worth three and the An124 is worth six. You can
argue the figures, which are based on payload but I use them as an
illustration of the relative sizing. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The political and industrial pressures are
such that I think we can expect the A400M to go ahead, althought the
numbers may be less certain. For the UK, there may be a difficulty
when it comes to giving up the C17s, as by that time the military
will have become used to the greater load capability. But that is
some time off. In the meantime the German proposal for a European
airlift command is gathering momentum, and we may see a pooling of
those assets which are in service around Europe at the moment.
Already we are seeing the Netherlands looking to the Germans to
provide their airlift.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">I should also mention tanker (AAR)
capability, which is just as important for these power projection
missions. Eurore (again except for France and the UK) is light in
this area. The UK has a large amount of money in the defence
programme set aside for a new tanker capability. It may do this by
contracting out the requirement. It is not clear that the rest of
Europe has focused sufficiently in this area.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT COLOR="#000000">New Ideas</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In any discussion about improving European
defence capabilities, the argument usually begins with a plea for
more spending on defence. It is also argued that greater integration
of defence industries would be beneficial. Neither approach has much
prospect of early success, and there can be no confidence that either
would generate real enhancements in capability without a radical
restructuring. Putting aside the political difficulties, Europe could
undoubtedly organise its defence spending more efficiently if it were
done on an integrated basis in the same way that the United States
organises its armed forces at the national level. Such an approach
for Europe will not be possible for many years (if ever), as it will
necessary for EU member nations to give up national sovereignty to
what is currently an unacceptable extent. There are similar, although
slightly less acute, difficulties with moves towards allocation of
military tasks to particular nations. This "Role Specialisation" was
much studied during the later stages of the Cold War. Even with a
common view of the mission, nations were reluctant to become reliant
on other Allies for particular capabilities. Nevertheless a de facto
specialisation has occurred as European nations have been unable to
match the technology of the US. It may be that there will be a
greater willingness for each European nation to undertake fewer
roles, but make those that they field more effective. This approach
will require close co-ordination if it is not to open up yet more
gaps in capability.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The proposals agreed at the 1999 Helsinki
Summit could provide an appropriate mechanism for co-ordinating
efforts between EU nations, and also keeping less enthusiastic
contributors up to the mark. It would allow nations to move towards
as much specialisation as they felt comfortable with, and to be
credited with real military contribution to the EU force component.
However this will take some years to develop. In the meantime there
is a danger that European capability will degrade further. What is
needed is some early action to improve capability without assuming
large budget increases. This can only be achieved by looking for ways
to reduce nugatory expenditure by cutting duplication, unnecessary
support overheads, and inappropriate capability. This is a painful
process even when carried out on a national basis. It will be yet
more difficult if it is to be carried out on an EU basis.
Nevertheless, it is the only immediate option available, and can be
done relatively rapidly given the political will. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">If we look at the European forces as a
whole, we see duplication of headquarters, planning, training,
logistics support, procurement, research, bases and other facilities.
This would be bad enough if the scale of the frontline in each nation
justified the scale of the support infrastructure, but it does not in
nearly all cases. Opportunities for more effective operation of
European military forces are apparent in land, sea and air
capabilities. However, the air capabilities offer more easily
achieved improvements for a number of reasons. Air procedures are
already better harmonised between nations than is the case for land
and sea power. This is partly because of air safety issues and partly
because speed of operation means that communications, standard
operating procedures, rules of engagement, planning methods and
terminology must all be agreed, standardised and practised between
air forces which are likely to operate together. English has become
the universal language of the air, and this considerably eases the
problem of mounting international combined air operations. Given the
high unit cost of air force platforms, it is not surprising that many
nations operate common equipment. This also eases the problems of
rationalisation. Finally, the high costs of infrastructure to support
air operations means that modest rationalisation can pay high
dividends in achieving greater military capability at lower
cost.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT COLOR="#000000">Possibilities for Early EU Air Power
Rationalisation </FONT></H4>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In looking for opportunities to provide more
effective European military power, the leap is too often made towards
a full scale integrated European army. Indeed the Helsinki proposals
are in danger of trying to achieve this step, which remains
impossible unless the EU becomes a much more politically integrated
entity. In the near term (the next 5 years), it would be much more
productive to look for opportunities to rationalise forces in being
which can be operated more efficiently on a multilateral or EU-wide
basis. The model for such a supranational activity is the NATO AWACs
force, which has successfully provided an airborne early warning
capability to NATO members at much lower day-to-day operating cost
than would have been the case if operated on an individual national
basis.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">What capability does Europe need which it
could operate on a similar basis to NATO AWACS? Airlift is an obvious
example. If forces are to be deployed rapidly, they need to be able
to call on a significant airlift capability. The focus on this,
particularly by the German government, and in the Helsinki statement,
is very welcome. However, coordination of assets and multinational
activity is different (and will be less efficient) than integration.
In looking for an opportunity for early rationalisation, we need to
identify a capability which is common to many EU members. The air
tactical transport role is a capability which most nations need, and
many provide for it at least partly using the C130 aircraft. Pooling
of some of these widely used C130 Hercules could provide an immediate
European tactical fixed wing transport capability. Provided that
nations structured their contributions sensibly, they could make
operating cost savings at the national level through closure of
bases, training units, and headquarters. The level of saving would
depend on the degree to which each nation felt able to rely on the
supporting infrastructure being provided by a European
facility.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Some ten EU nations operate C130 aircraft .
It would be possible to imagine a pooled fleet of 70 aircraft, which
would look after all the national C130 needs of Belgium (who operate
11), Denmark (4), Italy (10), Netherlands (2), Spain (12), Sweden (8)
and Portugal (6). France with 14 C130s and the UK with 55 have larger
transport aircraft fleets; and they could provide a partial
contribution of perhaps 6 and 10 aircraft respectively to the pooled
arrangement. Greece (15 C130s) might choose not to depend on pooled
aircraft. For those nations that were prepared to put all of their
C130 fleets into a common pool, there would be significant savings in
operating costs. They would also have a much better assurance of
availability on a day to day basis, given the ability to plan routine
servicing across a larger fleet. For Europe there would be a usable
airlift capability for humanitarian operations as well as for use
within NATO. Nor would nations lose the option to withdraw their
airframes and aircrews if they felt the need for some national
purpose. The force would not be rendered useless if one or more
nations declined to take part in a particular operation for national
reasons. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">However, for lower costs to be achieved this
would have to be quite different from current on-call multinational
arrangements. The force would operate from a single main base located
centrally in Europe, but would have dispersed flights to service
national needs. There would be a single headquarters, manned by
personnel from the contributing EU nations. Aircrew would be
multinational and not tied to the airframes provided by their
nations. There would be a single planning, servicing and logistics
organisation to support the force. Most importantly, the manpower,
headquarters, infrastructure and other savings would have to be
realised in the military structures of the contributing nations.
Those resources could then be redeployed to updating and enhancing
other capabilities. Over time, the management and operation of this
common fleet would lead to a common perception among participating
nations of the characteristics of the next generation transport
aircraft. This would have great benefits in terms of reducing
duplication of defence research and procurement costs in this
particular area. The extra costs of operating on a national basis
rather than a pooled basis would also become clear, and it is likely
that nations would begin to see the advantages of contributing to
such a force element. This would also increase the pressure for
common equipment procurement programmes for successor
aircraft.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In a slightly longer timescale, the
requirement for a large strategic airlift capability could be
tackled. The operation of such a fleet could easily be managed by the
same organisation that would look after the tactical C130 pooled
capability. It would be possible to procure a new capability of large
transport aircraft, which would be in harmony with the A400M
proposals. Costs would be lower than each nation trying to operate a
very small fleet of large and expensive aircraft. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Air to air refuelling capability is also
needed by all European air forces, and would be a natural candidate
for a European fleet operation. There is consideration being given to
procuring the UK air to air refuelling capability through a public
private partnership arrangement. This would be particularly easy to
enlarge to encompass those nations in Europe which sought such a
facility. The economics of the operation would improve for the larger
fleet and there would be no sovereignty issues to worry about given
the service is being provided by the private sector.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In the much longer term, it is possible to
contemplate the gradual development of the European Air Force as
experience of pooling forces is gained. Confidence would grow with
experience of the greater availability of air power assets to
individual nations, to the EU and to NATO. Such a force would be in
the lead for a wider integration of European defence capabilities,
which would require the development of a European defence budget.
Nations would still be able to retain independent national air
capabilities if they so wished, but such national air power would not
count as a contribution in European defence budget terms. </FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">There is a close parallel in these proposals
with the original evolution of independent national air forces.
Armies and navies wanted to own their own air power, and were
concerned about becoming too dependent on an independent air force,
which would be centrally controlled at the higher level. The costs,
confusion and inefficiencies of maintaining army and naval air forces
eventually led nations to form a third service which could procure
and use air power effectively. The next stage for such sensible
rationalisation must be an integration of air power across national
boundaries. Those national boundaries may have had physical meaning
on the ground and at sea, but are irrelevant in the air of Europe
today. If the political will were there, Europe could produce
effective modern air power, and could even do it more cost
effectively than does the United States.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT COLOR="#000000">Conclusion</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">I fear however that we are some way from the
political will to take these bold moves towards deeper force
integration. When it happens, as itmust because of budgetary
pressures, airlift is likely to be an early candidate. This will make
the proposals for airlift based on A400M even more politically
attractive, although I doubt the fleet size suggested will come to
pass. There is little hope of real increases in defence spending
throughout Europe, and that means that rectifying the deficiencies is
going to be slow and painful. The worry should not be about a strong
independent EU capability detracting from NATO, but about a
continuing weak EU capability undermining NATO.</FONT></P>
