<H3><CENTER>Nuclear Weapons - A reappraisal</CENTER></H3>

<ADDRESS><CENTER>St Antony's College, Oxford - 27 October 1998
</CENTER></ADDRESS>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Background</H3>

<P>With only ten minutes to cover "Deterrence in the cold war and
after (with special regard to global problems and the former and
remaining superpowers), I am of necessity going to have to make very
brief assertions about a set of complex issues. That is unfortunate,
but I trust we shall be able to use the discussion period to analyse
the thinking behind the assertions. My background is as a Physics
graduate from this university, a nuclear bomber pilot in the late
60's and early 70's when we were always 15 minutes from being
launched at our targets, a nuclear bomber squadron commander,
responsible for a dozen nuclear bombers and with my own long range
allocated missions against the Soviet Union if the Cold War became
hot, completing an MPhil in International Relations at Cambridge into
nuclear strategy, moving to a post with responsibility for air force
aspects of arms control  and ending up responsible for the planning
for all the RAF's nuclear capability. Some of what I say is therefore
based on academic research, some on practical experience and some on
policy development. It doesn't make it necessarily right, but it
shows you where I am coming from.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>The Cold War</H3>

<P>Let me split what I have to say into three. The past from
Hiroshima to the end of the Cold War, the present, and then the
possible futures. The post second world war period has been
characterised to the strategist by the dominating influence of
nuclear weapons on strategic thinking. After Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
no corner of the globe was in any doubt of the power of nuclear
weapons - and they were relatively small and crude compared with the
later accurately targeted fusion weapons. We can debate, but to no
great value, alternative ways the world might have developed after
1945 if the Baruch plan had been adopted, or if successive schemes to
reduce dependency on nuclear weapons had come to pass. The fact was
that the spread of the capability to manufacture such weapons was
very slow, the technology developed relatively slowly - and usually
in directions which enhanced stability. As a result deterrence
worked. As the confrontation hardened between the US and the SU, the
nuclear stalemate prevented war. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>There were times when technology moved towards less stable
arrangements. The search for defence against missiles in the 60's and
again in the 80's was happily unsuccessful. The move towards multiple
warheads with precision capability might have been destabilising had
the move on strategic capability  on to submarines made retaliation
certain. In any event, the effect of just a few successful nuclear
explosions on American, European or Russian territory would have been
so catastrophic (as the after effects of Chernobyl reminded us), that
deterrence had a great deal of robustness. The difficulty of
producing nuclear capability meant that it was almost certain that
any nuclear state was mature enough for deterrence to operate. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>None of this is to say that the world was anything but highly
dangerous. I spent 4 years sleeping next to my nuclear bomber, not
knowing whether the alert hooter was signalling yet another exercise,
or the end of the world. But we survived that most dangerous period
of the world's history. And after 45 years, we had still only 5
declared nuclear powers and perhaps 3 or 4 undeclared. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Today</H3>

<P>Today, we are deeply concerned about the proliferation of weapons
of mass destruction - with the focus on nuclear capability. We worry
that deterrence no longer operates in this more complex strategic
situation. First, we are right to continue to work at slowing nuclear
proliferation. There remains the danger of the catastrophe of the
use, either deliberate or accidental, of nuclear weapons. And the
risk must be increased as the numbers of weapons increases. Although
that risk is very small, the consequences are so large that the
international community is right to worry about it and take measures.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>We still have the 5 nuclear powers, US, Russia, UK, France and
China, to which we must add India and Pakistan as newly declared
nuclear states, and we assume that Israel remains an undeclared
nuclear state. South Africa and the Ukraine have given up their
capability. North Korea, Iraq and Iran are working hard at gaining a
capability. The total numbers of warheads in the world is at last
falling rather than rising, albeit not as fast as it could. The NPT
and the CTBT have been successes, albeit they could be better.
Negotiations on the Fissile Material Cut Off treaty will be another
good development. Nuclear deterrence seems to have started working
between India and Pakistan. </P>

<P>The only current nuclear threat that should keep us awake at night
is that posed by the decaying military structure in Russia.  Russia
still has 756 ICBMs, 648 SLBMs, Bombers and tactical nuclear weapons.
Progress on arms reduction is slower than it should be for a number
of understandable reasons. However control and monitoring of these
weapons should be the most urgent priority. Deterrence will not work
against an out of control military that has nothing to lose.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>What about deterrence against other WMD? Here I am less
optimistic. We group Nuclear, biological and chemical together as if
that made them possible to deal with in a single coherent way.
Biological weapons are much easier for rogue states to produce, and
much less amenable to verification regimes. Yet the threat of nuclear
retaliation to prevent biological warfare agents being used is a
fairly empty one. It may work in a set piece battle like the Gulf
war, but is much less credible in state sponsored terrorism events,
where the perpetrator is often unknown.  In sum, my belief for the
present is that  nuclear deterrence can still operate (the
India/Pakistan/China region), but for most nuclear powers it is not
greatly relevant. The management of reduction and control of cold war
arsenals is the most important issue, and enforcement of
anti-proliferation regimes need to continue.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>The Future</H3>

<P>What about the future?  think we shall see a continuing decline in
the attraction of nuclear weapons as a national capability. Those
states which have the capability will be reluctant to give it up -
the insurance policy argument. We might hope that the emergence of a
proper ESDI could see the UK and France making a donation of their
capability to Europe - but that is probably a long way off.  I doubt
that the UK will wish to invest in a successor to Trident. China is
perhaps the great uncertainty, and to that extent the retention of a
strategic capability by the US and Russia remains sensible.
Deterrence may be required again in the future to constrain the
ambitions of China if it were to go in that direction. As to the rest
of the world, while it is possible that some more states may gain a
nuclear capability, it is by no means certain and the world community
can do much to make it as difficult as possible. The greater danger
comes from Biological weapons as genetic engineering opens new
terrible possibilities. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In sum, we have survived the most dangerous period of the world's
history, it would be a shame if nuclear weapons came back to bite us
because we had relaxed too soon.</P>
