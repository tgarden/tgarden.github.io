<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">A Messy World</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In Europe, our approach to security has
changed dramatically in the past ten years. The benchmarks for
measuring our military needs have evaporated. Our defence needs
appear less urgent to our people and their elected representatives,
and the black and white division between good guys and bad guys is
much less easy. Yet wars, between States and within States, continue,
and large numbers of people both military and civilian continue to
die earlier than necessary because of conflict. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">On the world stage, we have the novelty of a
single super-power. The USA is preeminent in terms of both economic
and military strength - and yet, because of the far sightedness of
the founding fathers, is constrained from the traditional imperialism
that goes with such power. Nevertheless, any examination of the
utility of military power, must now always consider the part that the
USA will play.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The new era is messier and perhaps less
predictable than those that have gone before. Air power proponents
have often assumed that technological improvements would provide ever
better answers to security needs, and that can still be true for
particular needs. However, as the requirements become less certain
and the international concerns less amenable to military solution, we
need to examine carefully the most resilient ways of resourcing
military capability to meet the very varied demands of the
international community.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Difficult Questions</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The air power planner needs to ask:</FONT>

   future?</FONT>

   of US air power?</FONT>

   <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">Can we sustain political interest in
   providing the necessary resources?</FONT>
</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Looking Back</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">It is always easier to see the best plan
with the benefit of hindsight. A future historian writing in the year
2100 would look back to key phases of air power. He would marvel at
the speed with which the different main air power roles were
developed, so that virtually all had been deployed and tested in
combat within 15 years of the first heavier than air flight.
Technology refined the weapon systems, sensors and control
arrangements in the furnace of World War 2. Missiles and nuclear
warheads then dominated air power application for nearly half a
century. We are in a phase now where the advent of smart weapons and
information dominance seem to be key, but we have not yet got the
historical perspective to be able to say whether these technologies,
and their applications, will rate a chapter or just a footnote by the
year 2100. </FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Looking Forward</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">This discipline of seeing how we view the
past is sobering when we have to contemplate what provisions we
should make for the future. There is a tendency to assume that lesser
powers should follow the USA and look for high technology, power
projection capabilities. Reduction of the risk of casualties can
become a main factor. This approach appeals to the air power
enthusiast as aerospace systems tend to be associated with the
sexiest technologies, and are well suited to keep the butchery of war
at a safe distance from one's own citizens, even when they are in
uniform.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">There are however many counter pressures.
Throughout its brief history the provision of air power has been an
expensive undertaking. Separate air forces were necessary to ensure
the resources were used wisely both in procurement and in deployment.
Yet without some obvious national security problem, defence resources
decline. Not only is there less cash, there is also a less obvious
need for the most advanced weapon systems. The security problem
currently seems to be more likely to be an ethnically cleansed
refugee or a starving child in Africa. </FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Unknown Future</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Most defence planning tries to extrapolate
the experience of the recent past. This can lead to planning for the
last war instead of the next one. In the technology area
extrapolations are sometimes made from small scale laboratory
innovations, and assume that new techniques will be adopted
world-wide in a very short time. The trouble with all such
forecasting is that it fails, by definition, to take into account the
unpredictable key events or applications of technology. In
international affairs, we have seen the change in the Middle East
that has resulted from an assassin's bullet which killed Prime
Minister Rabin. Integrated circuits have changed the way that the
world operates over the past 30 years. The disasters at Three Mile
Island and Chernobyl have changed world views on the utility of
nuclear energy. Any assumptions for the future will inevitably be
proved wrong by events. Yet without assumptions planning becomes
chaotic.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">A Continuing World? </FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In any security analysis, the first question
to ask is whether there is any threat, however small, that a nation
might be totally annihilated. With the end of the Cold War, we have
reduced the risk of extinguishing life through a massive strategic
nuclear exchange. There are still more than enough nuclear weapons to
put at risk the viability of the planet, but we have more confidence
that they will not be used. To reduce the risk yet further means that
we must continue the arms reductions in this area. Military planning
must look at ways to reduce the threat of accidental nuclear use. In
India and Pakistan we should be seeking to transfer technology for
better control of their primitive nuclear systems. There is also
merit in de-alerting our own systems.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">As the worry of a nuclear winter has
receded, we have seen new global concerns emerge: ozone layer
depletion, global warming, over-fishing, reducing biodiversity,
atmospheric pollution, reduction in fresh water sources, population
growth, and epidemics. None of these are likely to threaten the
survivability of the species in the next 30 years, but all of them
represent key problems that will need to be addressed during the
period. There is also the random possibility of a strike by an
asteroid or comet, and it may be that the risk will be seen as
significant enough for work to be needed. Indeed, some suggest that
it is the sort of issue that air power strategists should focus on.
However for the purpose air power planning, we should assume that the
world will make it to 2030, but that it will be a much more crowded,
polluted and tense world.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">International relations </FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Any plan for the future must consider the
relations between states. The power of the State appears set to
decline. In one direction, many issues need to be dealt with at the
supranational level. Regional groupings form for economic reasons
initially, but develop into political entities. The debate over a
federal Europe is all about the vision of the economic community
transforming into a political entity with its own foreign and
security policy. In other parts of the world parallel moves are
happening, but the others are all at an earlier stage than the EU.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">It is too early to say how these regional
groupings will mature: they appear in some cases to look as though
there are limits to the degree of integration possible at the
supranational level. Yet in 30 years time, it would be surprising if
some had not formed arrangements akin to superstates. One might
envisage a European, an American and an Asian set of such groupings.
They might by then be co-operating or competing. From a defence
planning perspective one needs to make judgments about the future of
US relationships. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">While many of the potential problems of
today and tomorrow need a supranational approach, there is also a
tendency for power to move downward from States to individuals. The
widening recognition of the need to protect human rights, the wish
for ethnic groups to have self determination, increasing access to
information, increasing education of women, and the ability of
individuals to communicate globally, are all pointers to a future
where States may decline in power, and in some cases even break up
into smaller parts. </FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">United Nations</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">At the supranational level, the development
of global organisations will also be important. The United Nations
may be very different. It might have become more effective in its
decision-making, have the power to implement decisions, and be an
effective monitor of international behaviour. Perhaps, more likely,
it will have become less effective as the membership of the Security
Council is expanded, and decision making becomes more difficult.
Certainly the signs are that the process of changing the membership
may itself be damaging as arguments break out over which nations
should represent particular regions. Many would argue for a future
where the UN could act as the world's policeman with appropriate
forces on hand to enforce international law.The World Trade
Organisation may have developed to be a far more important entity in
moderating international behaviour. We are in the early days yet, and
there are plenty of opportunities for it to lose power. However,
given the universal advantage in well regulated trade arrangements,
it may be that WTO is a better horse to back as a future global
coordinator. </FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">European Union</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">We have a perception today that the states
of Western Europe, including the UK, are stable, co-operative, rich
and technologically advanced. We worry about high costs of labour, we
enjoy reasonable growth, albeit with unemployment a problem for many
of the countries. We look to an expansion of this sphere of stability
to encompass Central and Eastern Europe. New members of the EU may
come on stream within 5 years, and we expect that process to
continue. Problems may arise from relations with the former
Yugoslavia, Russia and the North African littoral states. </FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">There are black scenarios which might look
at today as being the peak of EU development as the strains of
greater integration, and monetary union in particular, lead to a
fracturing of the carefully built consensus. Or that the strains of
taking on new members, without some fundamental reforms of the Common
Agricultural Policy, cause the EU to stultify. Or that the great
Russian democratic experiment fails with a fall into complete
lawlessness, anarchy or military coup. Or that the populous poor of
North Africa repeat the Islamic invasion of the past, this time
seeking food rather than conquest. All these are possible, but
perhaps less likely than a progressive extension of the EU
strengthening security and prosperity in Europe. </FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Middle East</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">However, at the Eastern end of the
Mediterranean there is a more intractable problem between Israel and
its neighbouring states. 30 years ago Arab/Israeli wars happened, and
it may be that will remain possible for many years to come. Until
there is a harmonious relationship between an Israel that feels safe
and a viable Palestinian state, it is likely to remain a future
worry. For the remainder of the Middle East, and perhaps in the
Caucasus as well, the availability of oil is likely to be a factor
which is of increasing interest to the rest of the world.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Some fear Fundamental Islam as a unifying
force which will change the political face of the globe. More likely,
the differences within the factions of Islam are more than enough to
prevent such a single force operating in the next 30 years. Nor do
the predictions of Samuel Huntington, who has written of a clash of
civilisations, seem probable. Nevertheless, a global system of
individual rights and democracy will remain difficult to implement.
We remain to an extent prisoners of the present when thinking of the
Middle East. Thus we will worry about Iran and Iraq, but it may be
that there will emerge other personalities to worry us. Egypt has a
problem with fundamentalists, which it currently contains, but at the
price of slowing up economic reform. Saudi Arabia is not without its
potential difficulties. Recent terrorist acts in Africa have
highlighted the potential reach of groups based in
Afghanistan.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Asia-Pacific</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Asia Pacific region defies the
forecaster. Here we have two questions to consider: first, and most
importantly, where will China be in 30 years time; and second what of
the ASEAN nations? Again we find ourselves trapped in extrapolations
of what is happening at the moment. We flip-flop from overoptimistic
assumptions of prolonged double digit growth to assuming that the
current crisis may be the end of the tiger economies. In 30 years,
the region will be more populous and more developed. It will be
consuming more resources and more energy. It may or may not be
peaceful, and China will be a much more significant player in the
world. All this suggests that there is much to be said for engaging
China and drawing it into the global institutions such as the World
Trade Organisation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Japan is more difficult to assess. It seems
to be finding great difficulty in adapting fast enough to the new
global markets. Certainly the Japanese opinion formers are acutely
aware of the need for reform. Yet it may not be able to reform, and a
collapse of Japan would have major security implications. Korea still
has the possibility to surprise the world, and perhaps not in a
pleasant way. In this look at the future, we can postulate either a
unified Korea or a war devastated peninsular. Either are possible.
Nor is the Indian subcontinent's future assured. There are good signs
with the increase of high technology industry in India, but it has
not got its population problem under control. War with Pakistan
remains possible, but is perhaps less likely given that it could have
a nuclear dimension. </FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Africa</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">If we look at Africa, it is difficult to
envisage any rapid answer to the many problems of the continent. The
triumph of the return to democracy in South Africa, and also in
Mozambique and Namibia gives hope for a region of increasing
stability and prosperity in the South. Yet criminality could still
undermine that, and it will be many years before such potential
prosperity would encompass Central Africa. It seems likely that the
world will have to help the continent throughout the next 30 years.
Whether the richer nations will continue to be willing to do so is
another question. </FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Americas</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In Latin America, the move away from
military dictatorships to democracies has been a good development
over the past few years. There are some thriving economies with great
potential. Yet crime and corruption, often drug related, remains a
significant problem. Environmental issues are also likely to cause
tensions between the developed world and some South American states.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">However, the most important question for
future security planning is how the United States of America
approaches future problems. The world will be very different
depending on whether the US is prepared to continue to be the world's
policeman or retreats into regional isolation. The implications for
the sort of investment that Europe should make in security depends
critically on this issue. </FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Future Technology </FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The uncertainties of the future
international political and economic scene are not the only
difficulties for defence planning. Predicting the implications of
technology is equally impossible. It is a common perception that we
are in a time of unprecedented rate of technological change. In some
respects this is true, but there are some important caveats to be
made. At the end of the last century, scientists were beginning to
think they were within sight of having an explanation for everything.
Indeed scientific discovery and technological application to
industrial processes was remarkable then. There is perhaps a need to
introduce the concept of effective technology. Thus we have had
heavier than air flight for just short of a century, jet engines for
half that time. We have developed technology which allows us to fly
at supersonic speeds, but with a few exceptions, most air travel
continues to be at the same high subsonic speed that we have enjoyed
for the past 30 years. If you wish to improve transit times between
London and New York, a better return is achieved by speeding up the
process of getting from the centre of each city to the aircraft
before it takes off. Similarly the car has peaked in its effective
speed. The Thrust team have demonstrated that we have the technology
for a supersonic car, but the speed of traffic through cities is
declining. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">None of this is to suggest a Luddite view of
pure and applied research. It is more to point to the disparity
between the extrapolation of the laboratory experiment to full scale
production in the sort of societies that we anticipate. In the 60s,
we thought about about the exciting possible future applications for
lasers. While these included directed energy weapons, they have been
rather slow to be realised. Yet nobody suggested that many homes
would have a laser in the successor to the gramophone or every office
one in its successor to the typewriter. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">With all these uncertainties, what are the
technologies which will affect security over the next 30 years? They
will almost certainly include: materials science, nanotechnology,
genetic engineering, medicine, novel manufacturing techniques,
non-lethal warfare, yet more in communications and computing. The use
of space will be a fruitful area as well.The trend away from defence
being in the lead on R&amp;D towards the greater exploitation of
civil technologies will continue. We need to concentrate defence
research resources in the few narrow fields where civil research will
not help.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Military Power</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">We can draw a few conclusions for military
power. There is sufficient uncertainty in the immediate future to
make it necessary for any government to invest in providing for its
citizens' security. The more responsible, and wealthier, nations
should also be prepared to providing a contribution towards
international stability even when not directly threatened. That
agenda will give rise to an unquantifiable and potentially limitless
military requirement. Against the sorts of scenarios that are
discussed above, you could build up any force requirement that you
wished. This has been the problem in defence planning since the end
of the Cold War. In the end, the investment will be cost limited in a
fairly arbitrary way. The figure for many nations is around the 2% of
GDP level.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The air power enthusiast will make the case
for the special contribution that air systems can make to so many of
these future operations. The question is whether, for a resource
constrained nation where the direct threat is low, the attractions of
high cost air systems will be self evident. The combat unit numbers
will inevitably be low, and the support overheads proportionately
higher.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">New Possibilities in New Worlds</FONT>
</H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">One could suggest two possible futures for
air power. Doubtless neither will come to pass but perhaps they bound
the range of possibilities. First the developed world can continue on
its current path. We feel secure from major military threat, and we
see our security concerns as the results of crime, poverty and
environmental degradation. Military forces continue to be useful to
help diplomatic effort, and do the emergency jobs that no-one else is
willing to do. When conflicts or other situations which require
international intervention occur, we will look to the UN for
authority, and to the US for capability. Over a period of time, those
who wish to participate will have to follow the US lead in air power
equipment and doctrine if they are to be able to take part in
integrated operations. An increasing dependence on both US presence
and US defence industries will cause governments to question even
more whether they are wise to invest in expensive air systems, which
in any event are always just a part of a bigger and better US force.
They will tend to use their defence money for the ground forces which
will be needed in virtually every type of operation, and can be made
interoperable with the US at lower cost.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The other end of spectrum of possibilities
would require air power to be procured, trained, and operated at
above the national level. Just as in the first world war, when air
warfare become too expensive and important to be left to the army and
navy, it may be that we are coming to a stage where this is true for
individual nations. NATO AWACs has shown that it is possible for
nations to club together to deploy a very expensive, high technology,
key air power asset. It is strange that the great burst towards
multinational forces has been led by ground formations. While our air
forces operate together routinely without any problem, that is not
the answer to the problems of economies of scale. Air forces are
uniquely easy to operate on a multinational basis - the language of
the air is English, the procedures are international. If medium sized
nations are to field air power capabilities of significance, they
will need to merge their research, development, procurement,
training, and operational capability. This is quite an undertaking,
but not impossible and would of course go hand in hand with a
stronger European defence aerospace industry and a real European
Security and Defence Identity.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">A Watershed?</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">We do not debate the implications of the
long term decline in capabilities often enough. It would be
politically difficult (particularly for the UK) to make air forces
operate at the supranational level, but if we are all planning to
carry out military operations at the supranational level, perhaps it
is time to think how we might make it come to pass. One could
conceive in the longer term of a European air force. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">This is not a possibility for the immediate
future: it is however an alternative to the inevitable decline of
European air power capability in a world where military operations
are discretionary rather than compulsory. Air power has thrived on
adapting to new challenges and exploiting new opportunities, and
there are plenty of those in the new era. The UK air power planners
of today need to be thinking about ways in which Europe can operate
its air power on a more equal basis with the United States. The
United Kingdom Government has indicated that it wishes to take a lead
in making the European defence capability more effective. There are
many opportunities open. Four nations are procuring their new
generation combat aircraft, Eurofighter, at the same time. A pooled
European force would be cheaper to operate, easier to man, and much
more effective. A similar approach could be adopted for the European
airlift and air-to-air refueling requirement. Such an approach is not
limited only to air forces, but they are the easiest place to start
and produce the greatest increase in effectiveness. By 2012, perhaps
there could be a European aircraft carrier group with the UK
contributing the money allocated in last year's strategic defence
review.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">We live in uncertain times, and currently
expect the Americans to rescue the world when it gets into
difficulty. Europe can afford to become a more equal partner, and
European air power could show how this can be achieved.</FONT></P>
