				</FONT><B>Dear Crispin,</B><BR>
				 Great news. I see even Tony Blair now thinks we are not going to find any WMD in Iraq. He must be feeling pretty upset after all the effort he put into selling the dodgy dossier message. The downside is that he, and his partner in spin, George Bush, have made the world much more sceptical about threat assessments based on intelligence.</p>
			<P>You and I know that intelligence is more an art than a science. We weren't too clever about predicting the Falklands conflict, the end of the cold war, the invasion of Kuwait, most of what went on in the Balkans in the 90s, or even the threat from al-Qaida before 9/11. The world is getting more dangerous. Failing states, suicidal terrorists, international crime and those good old weapons of mass destruction are all real dangers. But what hope of convincing sceptical publics next time when perhaps there is a real threat?<BR>  <B>Yours, Tim</B>
			<P><B>Dear Tim</B><BR>  I agree with much of what you say. Mr Blair has done considerable damage to the reputation of British intelligence and the intelligence process in general. I used to draft papers for the joint intelligence committee in the days BDDD (before the dodgy dossier(s) debacle). "Approved by the JIC" was accepted in both London and Langley as a real mark of sound judgment and analytical quality. It's a shame that Only Fools and Horses is not filming any more - I can just imagine Del Boy at his stall in Peckham spinning his own range of dodgy merchandise to the cry of, "Approved by the joint intelligence committee!"<div id="OvertureDivHolder"><div id="OvertureDiv"></div></div><P>Nevertheless, just because they cooked the intelligence books on both sides of the Atlantic this time does not mean that the whole idea of pre-emptive war (the anticipatory use of force in the face of attack within 45 minutes) or preventive action (the anticipatory use of force in the face of a hunch that the other guy might do something very nasty to you at some time in the future) is entirely misguided or too difficult to be a practical option. I suspect that elevating it into a doctrine as President Bush did in his speech to the class of 2002 at West Point was going too far but it may be a useful tool in future. And pre-emptive action does not necessarily have to involve regime change. It can be more modest - for instance, the Israeli air strike on the Osirek nuclear reactor in 1981.<P>To be sure, any such action would have to include intelligence as part of the justification package. Mr Blair could not pull it off again - the country would not believe him. But we tend to give new prime ministers the benefit of the doubt - I see no reason why the British people would not be wearily prepared to trust Messrs Brown, Howard or Kennedy in future military support for Bush/Kerry or even Chirac.<BR>  <B>Yours, Crispin</B><P><B>Dear Crispin</B><BR>  We face a real problem. As the covert Libya WMD programme and Dr AQ Khan's nuclear supermarket has shown, dubious states and perhaps fanatical terror organisations might succeed in developing the means to kill large numbers of our citizens. Yet the intelligence services seem to be caught on the hop each time. Now even if we were to get good timely intelligence of a serious threat, it would very difficult for governments in either Europe or the US to convince the public of the need for early action. Europe has been pretty uncomfortable with the emphasis on pre-emption in the 2002 US national security strategy. To pre-empt with military force legitimately, you need overwhelming evidence that there are no other alternatives.<P>I agree with you that the case for pre-emption may appear stronger in a world where we face some potentially catastrophic threats. However, we do need to ask whether early use of military force, even if it were legal, would solve longer term problems. We have seen with Iraq how a pre-emptive intervention, with a short-term military success, has promoted instability in a wider region. We are probably less safe now because we used force in Iraq. And if we justify our pre-emptive actions as reasonable self-defence in the light of intelligence, are we happy for other nations to join this happy band of adventurers?<BR>  <B>Yours, Tim</B><P><B>Dear Tim</B><BR>  You make a series of valid points broadening the discussion out but behind your analysis, I detect gloom/disapproval over Iraq.<P>Let's look at how things could have gone better in Iraq - not 20/20 hindsight but a small nudge to three of the variables that have given pre-emptive action a bad name. Imagine:<P>1. No fibs/porkies were told in London before the start of the war but a broadly based case made for supporting the United States (Atlanticism; draining the poison in the Middle East; Saddy was a baddy) of which intelligence was only a part.<P>2. An American army trained and equipped as well for peacekeeping/occupation operations as it was for the invasion of Iraq and deployed in sufficient numbers to picquet the Syrian and Iranian borders.<P>3. Bush, Cheney and Rummy were slightly less arrogant and irritating.  Voil&agrave;. You feel better already.<BR>  <B>Crispin</B><P><B>Dear Crispin</B><BR>  Guilty as charged. I did disapprove of the Iraq intervention and I am gloomy about the future that has resulted. However, it is hardly hindsight. I published articles in the Guardian and elsewhere warning of the dangers months before the intervention. I am afraid your alternative history does not help the case at all.<P>1. If the intelligence had been sound, then there was no legitimate case for intervention. Containment was working and we had a series of more urgent proliferation problems in North Korea, Pakistan and Libya. We could have made a good case for intervening in 1988 after the gassing of the Kurds, or again in 1992 when he put down the Marsh Arabs, but things were pretty quiet until we poked a stick in the hornet's nest last year.<P>2. We can all run a better scenario for the post-conflict reconstruction of Iraq, but then we can all hope to win the lottery as well. Donald Rumsfeld used to be proud that US forces didn't do peacekeeping. Maybe he will see it as important now, and they can spend the next 10 years training how to do it. Even so, the crass mismanagement of the situation by Ambassador Bremer would have made the process challenging.<P>3. It is not the arrogance of the US leadership which annoys me, it is their lack of judgment. A characteristic they share with Tony Blair.<P>I might feel better if there were any sign that British and American leaders had learned how from the experience. The UN and the EU had a rather better idea of how to handle the problem.<BR>  <B>Yours, Tim</B><P><B>Dear Tim</B><BR>  Good. I think the difference in our positions is emerging. You see, I think Tony Blair's grand strategic judgment on what the world is like is sound. His speech of Friday March 5 about the "real and existential" threat of terrorism and WMD was spot-on and still provides all the justification you need for toppling the likes of Saddam. The delivery was a little mannered for my taste and it is getting very difficult to tell him and Rory Bremner apart but still...<P>Where Mr Blair went seriously wrong was to justify the war on an intelligence case alone. I suspect in reality that intelligence was only partly instrumental in his actions and that he understands full well the proper (secondary) place for intelligence in support of decision-making. But an intelligence case was the only way to keep the support of many of his colleagues. Sadly, on the way it also meant debauching the central intelligence analytical machinery!<P>I liked your little joke at the end that the UN and EU had a rather better idea of how to handle the problem.<BR>  <B>Yours, Crispin</B><P><B>Dear Crispin</B><BR>  Try to remain rational. Blair can be right about the future threat of terrorists with WMD, but be wrong about Iraq. Saddam Hussein saw Islamic extremists as threats to his own position. As a result of the intervention in Iraq, we have multiplied the potential terrorist problem many times over. The recruits swarm to the chaos and are trying to turn the country into another Afghanistan. Saudi Arabia is much more fragile and the extremists garner more support. Pakistan is vulnerable to a bloody coup, which might then put nuclear weapons in the hands of religious fanatics.<P>I suppose we should count ourselves lucky that the intelligence on Iraqi WMD was wrong. With the lack of protective equipment for UK forces, we might have suffered massive casualties in the initial intervention. Suppose that there had been stores of chemical and nuclear material. The period of looting and anarchy after the fighting last year would have ensured that every terrorist in the region picked up a supply for future use against us.<P>The UN security council refused to be railroaded into an unnecessary war and the EU advocated continuing inspection. If Blair had listened to both organisations, the world would be a bit safer than it is now. It is not a matter for jokes.<BR>  <B>Yours, packing my survival kit, Tim</B><P><B>Dear Tim</B><BR>  Well, it seems to me that the Islamist extremists were coming to get us anyway. It has little to do with Iraq. In the same way there was always going to be some kind of Islamist extremist challenge to &#91;Pakistani president Pervez&#93; Musharraf and the Al Saud &#91;Saudi ruling family&#93;. In the Saudi case, at least a number of their extremists are now too busy in Iraq to add to the mischief in their own country - with the added bonus that the US army is managing to take some of them out.
			<P>One final thing in defence of the intervention in Iraq. At least part of the thinking behind it was that if you can make the Middle East a safer, dare I say it, more rational place, you stand a better chance of getting some sort of decent settlement between the Israelis and the Palestinians. That conflict really is the great recruiting sergeant for Islamist extremism and terror. Removing Saddam was an essential building-block in that plan.<BR>  <B>Ciao for now,  Crispin</B>
