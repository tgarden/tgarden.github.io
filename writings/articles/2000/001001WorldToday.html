<H4><FONT COLOR="#000000">Blair Initiative</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In one aspect of EU development,  the United
Kingdom is seen by its European partners as the leading innovator and
driving force. The work that has taken place over the past two years
on European Defence Policy (EDP) is widely known as the Blair
Initiative. No one believes that the enthusiastic adoption of EU
defence goals at Helsinki in 1999 would have been possible without
the key work by the British government over the preceding year. 
However, there are now signs that the process is getting bogged down,
and that new imaginative proposals are needed. Britain  seems
surprisingly reluctant to take the lead again. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In the immediate aftermath of the 1997 UK
General Election, the new Labour government gave every impression
that it would continue the transatlantic focus to defence policy that
had been pursued so assiduously by all its post-war predecessors. The
Strategic Defence Review (SDR) took this as its foreign policy
assumption, and had little to say about Europe. The promotion of the
Western European Union (WEU) as a safety valve for any schemes for
wider European military ambitions was retained as a policy aim. Yet
no sooner was the SDR published than a new approach to European
defence was formulated in the inner circles of government. The
increasing enthusiasm for producing a better EU defence posture can
be tracked through a series of summit meetings. In October 1998 at
P&ouml;rtschach, Tony Blair indicated that the UK would be prepared
to consider military co-operation within the EU. The December 1998
Franco-British summit at 1998 provided the real breakthrough with
proposals for improved EU defence capabilities, and the requirement
for Europe to have "the capacity for autonomous action". </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The last year of the Twentieth Century was
momentous in western defence terms. NATO celebrated its 50th birthday
by revising its strategic rationale, examining its shortcomings,
expanding its membership, and fighting its first war. The Washington
summit in April 1999 produced a strategic concept which was in line
with the analysis that had been undertaken in Europe about likely
future roles. The lack of capabilities, particularly among European
members, was identified as an area for action. The air campaign in
Kosovo demonstrated in graphic terms the enormous imbalance between
US and European capabilities. Decisions over the bombing tactics or
ground force options reminded European leaders of their dependence on
American policy as well as firepower. Kosovo as a lesson in power
politics provided another impetus to the work on EDP.  The Cologne
Council of June 1999 transformed the various bi-lateral initiatives
into an EU process. The leaders decided to set up the necessary
institutional arrangements for the EU to deal with defence. This
included an agreement to transfer WEU assets to the EU by the end of
the following year. The new post of High Representative for Common
Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) was agreed and it was filled by
the ex NATO Secretary General, Javier Solana, in the autumn. </FONT>

<H4><FONT COLOR="#000000">Helsinki  Goal</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The culmination of all this activity was the
Helsinki European Council of 11-12 December 1999. After the important
philosophical and institutional groundwork had been done at the
previous meetings, Helsinki was to produce concrete military
capability proposals. The member states set themselves a "headline
goal". They looked to develop an EU force which would be capable of
carrying out corps level (about 50-60,000 troops) tasks. These tasks
would include the most demanding of peacekeeping, humanitarian and
crisis management, but NATO would remain the vehicle for territorial
defence requirements. Rightly, the Helsinki goal spells out the
supporting requirements for such an independent power projection
force. It needs command and control, intelligence, logistics, combat
support,  and the necessary air and naval elements. It has to be able
to be deployed within 60 days and self sustaining for a year. All of
this is to be achieved by 2003. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Once the Helsinki aim was agreed, the work
has transferred largely from the political process to the
bureaucratic. Defence ministries have to look at how they can tailor
their capabilities to fit the new requirement. The focus for this
effort is the Capabilities Commitment Conference to be hosted by
France at the end of November 2000. There is an extraordinary amount
of detailed staff work to do. In order to list the capabilities 
needed, scenarios must be agreed. These include the possibility of
having to conduct the separation of warring factions by force,
humanitarian assistance and evacuation of civilians, and conflict
prevention operations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT COLOR="#000000">Capability Shortfall</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Some 144 different capabilities have been
identified as requirements, and these in turn have been grouped into
seven main categories: C3I (Command, Control, Communication and
Intelligence); ISTAR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition
and Reconnaissance); deployability and mobility; effective
engagement; protection and survivability; sustainability and
logistics; general support. Land, sea and air capabilities to fill
these requirements must be identified for allocation. The data is
being assembled in the Helsinki Headline Goal Catalogue.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">This staff work is an important part of the
process. EU defence officials and military policy makers are having
to work together to shape the proposals for this new force and in
doing so will learn to co-operate further. However, the time is short
and the deficiencies are large. Many countries will wish to allocate
overlapping capabilities, whereas none will be able to provide key
enablers which are missing. These deficiencies were identified back
in April 1999 in the NATO Defence Capabilities Initiative, and
nothing has been done to rectify the shortcomings since then. EU
nations will have plenty of fighter aircraft to offer, but few
reconnaissance drones available. There is no shortage of infantry to
double-hat for this force, but there are shortages of secure
communication systems for them to talk to one another. There is no
possibility that the many expensive shortfalls will be made good by
2003. The EU has no funds to provide the necessary capabilities, and
the member states have already committed their declining defence
budgets to national needs in the near term.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT COLOR="#000000">French Presidency</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The current French Presidency was seen as a
time of great opportunity for pushing forward EDP. The French have
taken a lead with Britain rightly in keeping the focus on capability
issues. However, the institutional arrangements are important, and
are not yet solved. The WEU seems reluctant to bow out. The lack of
congruence between the EU membership and NATO's European membership 
also remains a potential difficulty. Poland, Hungary, the Czech
Republic, Turkey, Norway and Iceland  have to worry about the EU
dealing on their behalf with the US within NATO. Austria, Finland,
Ireland and Sweden may have parallel concerns about their EU forces
being drawn in to NATO activities. Nor does France's absence from the
NATO integrated military structure make life any easier. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">It looks likely that the French Presidency
will end with great self congratulation by EU members about how much
has been achieved in progress towards the Helsinki requirement.
However, the difficult and expensive shortfalls in military
capabilities will still not be provided. There will be some bright
spots. Germany has been doing some important work on developing
proposals to improve mobility. They are working hard to establish an
EU airlift capability, which they hope in the longer term to
supplement with sealift. This will involve a number of nations
contributing to a joint force. As yet, it is too early to say whether
this will be more than just another multinational activity. There is
no shortage of European multinational forces. Most are less efficient
and more expensive than their single nation equivalents. If Europe is
to improve its capability, it must look for ways to operate more
efficiently. This means that pooling of forces and eliminating
duplication of support must be undertaken. This is not an easy road
for national politicians, or indeed for national military
officers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT COLOR="#000000">Pooling Capabilities</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">NATO operates one  capability at the
supranational level. The AWACS (Airborne Early Warning and Control
System) force is funded through NATO, shared between the nations and
manned by many nationalities. It is a good model of how the EU might
operate pooled capabilities at much lower costs. Much of the
disparity between European and American capabilities is not a
question of absolute spending levels (the EU spends about $140
Billion a year on defence), but is about the way it is spent. Each EU
member duplicates the others headquarters, training, support and
logistics structures. Defence is still nationalised. The German
proposals for mobility might produce a greater enthusiasm for shared
military resources. However that will not be enough to make European
defence viable. John Roper and I have argued that the delivery of
Eurofighter to five EU nations from 2002 onwards could provide a
unique opportunity to field an effective European pooled capability.
However, the time is now very short and there is little prospect of
such a force being established. This does not mean that Britain
should abandon its lead in promoting a more effective European
defence capability. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The UK defence programme includes  financial
provision for replacing its air-to-air refuelling fleet. It is
looking at how this might be done by a private contractor. There are
few sovereignty issues with such a capability, particularly as it may
be done by contract. Europe is desperately short of this enabling
capability. If the contract were let on an EU basis, the unit cost
would be reduced, the capability increased and the costs shared. Tony
Blair could get his initiative back on the rails by making such a
proposal at Nice in December. It would be the start of a European
defence budget, which is the key missing link in the current
institutional arrangements. Without such leadership, the European
defence adventure looks set to end  in failure like its many
predecessors. Nor can we be sure that the United States will be
prepared to fill the gaps as it always has in the past.</FONT></P>
