			<h3>Echoes of War</h3>
			<p>by Sir Timothy Garden</p>

			<p>The last month has been a time for remembering past wars; but the echoes from the past come at time when the headlines are dominated by current conflicts, and the potential for new wars. The death of the Queen Mother ensured that pictures of the bomb damage in the East End of London during the Blitz were on all the television channels. It was a useful reminder of the horrors of modern war at the individual level. An exhibition at the London Museum juxtaposed photographs of  Ground Zero at the World Trade Center with those taken in the streets of London during the Blitz. The horrors of 11 September 2001 are dwarfed by the devastation of London sixty years before. <br>
				<br>
				It has also been a week for remembering the Falklands Conflict. Over 1000 soldiers, sailors and airmen, of which a quarter were British, died in this campaign, which introduced us to the diplomatic difference between &quot;Conflict&quot; and not a &quot;War&quot;. Twenty years ago, the UK could conceive of mounting an amphibious operation at a distance of 8000 miles. The despatch of the task force was done over a weekend. It was a virtually single nation operation. The US provided some logistics help through the base at Ascension Island, and some intelligence assistance. Some South American neighbours of Argentina stood by to provide emergency help when needed. But in the end the UK was able to retake the Falklands on its own with the enemy homeland only 400 miles from the theatre of operations. Much has been written (and has still to be written) about this extraordinary military operation. The use of a cascade system of air to air refuelers to mount Vulcan bombing missions from Ascension to Port Stanley meant a round trip of 8000 miles &#150; long before the American stealth B2 bomber had been thought about. Of course UK forces were larger then, and were equipped for their primary role in the defence of Western Europe. Today, we seem to have little confidence in our ability to mount much of a military operation without the direct support of US power. <br>
				<br>
				There are other strange echoes of wars. A rerun on Cable TV of the satirical &quot;Drop the Dead Donkey&quot; is full of references to Bush's intentions to invade Iraq, and of the problems between the Israelis and the Palestinians. These all date from the early 1990s: yet the headlines seem to be relevant to today. The trial of Milosevic and the search for other Balkan war criminals remind us of the unfinished business in the former Yugoslavia. The deepening conflict in Israel and the Occupied Territories hog the headlines, but as yet there seems little appetite among the Western nations for intervention beyond the diplomatic. It remains questionable how long this lack of involvement can be sustained by either Europe or the USA.<br>
				<br>
				In Afghanistan the two pronged war and peace operation continues, with the UK apparently more interested in the warfighting as it attempts unsuccessfully to disengage from the peacekeeping. The Marines are now arriving in theatre and have a fortnight of acclimatisation before starting operations. And over all of this hangs the prospect of a major operation against Iraq. Tony Blair seems to be cracking the whip over his Cabinet doubters, and the message from the British Government seems to be to talk tough. General Mike Walker, the Chief of the General Staff, is reported to have told his commanders to prepare for a major operation in the second half of the year. <br>
				<br>
				What are the lessons from all this nostalgia for wartime coupled with rumour about new conflicts? First the British military have an unparalleled recent history of success. The British public expects its army, navy and air force to be better than other nations and to succeed in every task. The failure of the Suez operation is blamed on political leadership; and British troops were not involved in the Vietnam War. The Falklands was a risky war, which might have gone wrong. Subsequently, the presence of US overpowering force in the Gulf War, Kosovo and Afghanistan have masked any reductions in capability of UK forces. The British frontline grows smaller by the day, and is now explicitly shaped on the assumption that we will be operating with the USA for difficult hostile conditions. We contemplate 6 years, between 2006 and 2012,  of operating our aircraft carriers without their own dedicated air defence aircraft. With troops still in Northern Ireland, the Falklands, the Balkans and Afghanistan we find ourselves enmeshed for years after each conflict. Yet the numbers willing to serve in the armed forces are in steady decline. It may be that we shall discover the limits of our military power sooner rather than later. The consolation is that on past record, the politicians will rightly get the blame. <br>
