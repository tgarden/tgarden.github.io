			<h3>National Missile Defence plays badly in Europe</h3>
			<p><i>Sir Timothy Garden</i></p>

		<p>There is a tendency in Europe to be rather patronising about American security fears. After all, we have suffered a century of devasting wars fought across our lands; and we were moments away from nuclear devastion throughout the Cold War. Today, we feel much safer and find it difficult to get excited about some future possible threat from distant parts of the globe. In the USA, fears about missile attacks from North Korea, Iran, Iraq and perhaps China seem much more urgent. It is easy to understand the immediate appeal to the American population of the promise of defences against such an awful prospect as a nuclear, biological or chemical attack. The US has a long and expensive history of failed attempts to provide itself with defences against incoming ballistic missile attack. </p>
		<p>The strategic implications  of  missile defences are still much the same as they were for President Reagan&#146;s Strategic Defense Initiative despite today&#146;s  more limited  aims. In Europe, many fear that undermining the Anti -Ballistic Missile treaty will unpick all the hard won achievements of arms control over the past 30 years. The proponents of NMD argue that if the US manages to renegotiate the treaty with the Russians, there would be no such problem. Unfortunately, the elements of the NMD system are not just minor treaty changes.  The obvious counter-move for  nuclear powers is to increase the number of their nuclear systems. China certainly sees this as its best way forward, and it looks as though Russia may follow suit. Emerging powers  may decide it is easier to use less traditional routes for weapon delivery. None of this is helpful in promoting international confidence and safety. </p>
		<p>The Bush Administration is assuring critics that they plan to provide effective protection for Europe as well. In Europe, the feeling is that the technical viability of such an extended system is even more suspect, the cost enormously greater and in any event there would be a transition period of perhaps years before the system was so extended. Europeans do not share the US view of how to handle the threat of proliferation in difficult States. Nor do they believe that a missile defensive system can protect against the many different types of threat that might emerge. In some respects the long range missile threat is the least likely, and nuclear deterrence remains a sufficient strategy.</p>
		<p>Some NMD enthusiasts proclaim that  a defended US will be more confident in undertaking interventions around the world. Yet it is difficult to imagine a level of defensive assurance that will change the approach the US takes in its dealing with difficult nations. No future President would be so confident of the efficacy of an NMD system that he could ignore the potential risk of a nuclear strike.  From a military perspective, the loss of money for other capabilities is likely to be the more important aspect.</p>
		<p>However, despite these  doubts, which are shared by a wide body of opinion in and out of government in Europe, what right have we Europeans to interfere in the internal security arrangements of the United States? The answer is that we fear that NMD may make the world a more dangerous place, will reduce European security and in the UK give us some internal as well external problems.</p>
		<p>The particular policy problem for the UK government is that two installations (Fylingdales radar station and Menwith Hill communications facility) will both be integral parts of any US NMD system. The necessary upgrades are likely to breach the ABM treaty unless it is renegotiated. The Blair Government has refused to take a public view on the question, but the UK Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee has been very critical.  It looks as though we shall find ourselves having to choose between our strong US  ties and our wish to be leading in Europe.</p>
		<p>What should the rest of the world do? After all, it appears that work is going to continue on this ill-starred system.  A move which is likely to result in a less safe world in general, and a less safe Britain in particular, for no advantage is one in which Britain and Europe have a legitimate interest.  However souring relationships with the United States - Europe&#146;s closest and most important ally - would damage NATO and thus  also harm our joint security interests. European leaders should argue for full involvement in a genuine negotiation over the future shape of the ABM Treaty. They should encourage the US to look more closely at boost-phase systems, which may be less destabilising. Finally, they must co-operate in finding ways to bring the pariah States back into the international community, and preventing them from acquiring weapons of mass destruction in the meantime. None of this will be easy.</p>
