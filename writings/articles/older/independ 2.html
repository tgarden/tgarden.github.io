<P>The first chilly wind of Balkan winter has begun to blow through
the corridors of NATO. The mountainous terrain around Kosovo becomes
ever more difficult for military operations from the middle of
October each year. By that time, either the refugees will feel secure
enough to return to their home towns, or there will be more than a
million displaced people needing warm shelter in Albania and
Macedonia. Any military planner must start with the desired political
aim and then plan how to achieve that aim with best chance of success
and least risk of failure, given the constraints of time, ground and
resources. NATO's aim is to get the Kosovo Albanians back to their
land in safety. A delay into winter would make this doubly difficult.
Better shelter than tented camps would be needed in Macedonia and
Albania for the winter, and rebuilding new housing to replace the
destroyed towns in Kosovo would be much more difficult. All of this
means that any sensible plan will seek to provide secure warm shelter
in Kosovo by around mid October. This in itself will need a vast
civil-military operation. Prefabricated dwellings will need to be
airlifted in with teams of construction workers and military
engineers to clear the debris of war and erect the buildings. It
might be that, with some sharing of housing, a useful provision could
be made over a period of perhaps 6 weeks.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The ticking clock of winter and the practicalities of the
rehousing of the refugees mean that the international armed
peacekeeping force will need to be in place in Kosovo around the
beginning of September. If air power provides the lever for an
agreement between Serbia and the international community, time would
still be needed to install the peacekeepers. However under benign
conditions, where the troops were not officially opposed by the
Serbs, the build up of peacekeepers could be done in a progressive
way starting with the NATO force currently deployed in Macedonia.
These 16,000 troops would need to move quickly to ensure that no
power vacuum existed in Kosovo following a withdrawal of Serbian
forces. With feelings running high between Serb and Albanian groups,
the numbers needed by the time of the return of the refugees is
likely to be nearer 40,000 than the 28,000 assumed in the Rambouillet
discussions. These would take at least a month to put on the ground.
If a diplomatic settlement is to be successful, it will need to be
delivered by the end of July.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The military planner must always look at the worst case. When you
plan for the worst, things usually turn out better; when you fail to
make such plans, the outcome is invariably worse. In order to get the
necessary agreement to start the air campaign, NATO leaders had from
the start to discount the use of ground troops entering Kosovo
opposed. This posture has made the need for ground troops fighting
their way into Kosovo more likely. A steady build up of NATO forces
in the surrounding countries, coupled with masterful ambiguity, would
have been much more coercive to the Serbian leadership. There would
have been a realistic threat that Serbia would find Kosovo taken by
military force, and Milosevic would have seen greater advantage in
negotiating. The military planners will have made this point and
prepared and updated contingency plans as time has gone on. The UK
government was the first of the NATO members to indicate that it was
prepared to think about the ground option. Tony Blair tried hard to
bring US opinion round when he went to the Washington summit at the
end of April. However all the signs are that the America has hardened
against committing its men to fight a war in the Balkans.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Keeping our aim of getting the refugees home before winter in
sight, where does that leave us now? The constraints of time mean
that if we wish to launch a ground invasion we should allow perhaps 4
weeks for it to be carried out. It therefore needs to be started by
mid July. That leaves just 8 weeks to put together the necessary
force. The two months could be spent in continuing efforts to
convince the United States to change its mind, or more productively
in getting on with forming an ad hoc coalition from European nations
and any others that wanted to contribute. How big a force would be
needed? We know that Rambouillet called for a force of 28,000 to
police an agreed deal. After all the atrocities and ill feeling
generated between Serb and Albanian that number is more likely to be
around 40,000 now. More would be needed to intervene into a hostile
defended Kosovo. Much would depend on how successfully the air
campaign had degraded the Serbian forces on the ground. In the Gulf
War, 6 weeks of an air campaign meant that the ground campaign was a
4 day walkover. After 3 months of air attacks on Kosovo, a much
smaller area than Iraq, the ground forces may well be demoralised.
Nor may they be the hardened fighters that their grandfathers were in
World War 2. The fact that they use heavy armour for ethnic cleansing
suggests a less than warrior culture. Nevertheless we must plan for
the worst case; just as we did in the Gulf War. A force of around
80,000 might be necessary, prepared to take casualties and to fight
until Kosovo was free for its people to return. The air support for
such a campaign would be provided by the NATO air forces currently
deployed, but supplemented by more ground attack and helicopter lift
capability.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Could Europe put together such a force at such short notice?
Certainly in raw numbers the continent has no lack of men in uniform.
However, we must discount most conscripts and reserves. Nevertheless,
if France, Germany and the UK were to take a lead in proposing such a
force, they should be able to find assistance from not only other EU
members but also new NATO members, prospective NATO members and even
countries further afield. 80,000 troops should not be beyond the
bounds of possibility. This is exactly the operation that was
discussed in seminars endlessly over the past 5 years: a military
operation to be conducted by the Europeans using NATO assets. If the
major EU player governments agreed with support from other EU
members, we could see the European Defence Identity take a great leap
forward, and we might have a chance of rescuing the Kosovans from
ethnic cleansing and NATO from oblivion.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>How would the operation be conducted? Once a European led ground
force option became a reality, the air campaign would be orchestrated
to prepare for the ground intervention. Operating height restrictions
on aircraft would be removed. Harriers, A10s (if the US so wished)
and other allied ground attack could be used to create cleared
bridgeheads for the ground forces. The Apache armed helicopters would
have a useful role in the early stages of any insertion, whereas they
have no useful role under current constraints. It might be that a
diplomatic settlement would come before such a force was launched. It
might be that the Serbian defences would crumble at the first
engagement. But it could also be a hard war which would take weeks to
finish. In any of these cases, NATO's aim to restore the refugees to
their homes would be achieved. Europe would face a brighter and more
confident future. The relationship between the United States and
Europe would have changed for the better to one of equal partnership
in promoting international peace and security.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The next month will see a critical point in the way the world is
to be in the future. The UK Government has a pivotal role to play for
enormously high stakes. If we fail, and Kosovo ends in an inadequate
diplomatic fudge which leaves Milosevic the winner, then neither NATO
nor a European Security and Defence Identity have any future. The
transatlantic relationship will be in jeopardy and isolationism on
both sides of the Atlantic will be the way of nations. Not often are
the stakes so high and the prizes so great.</P>
