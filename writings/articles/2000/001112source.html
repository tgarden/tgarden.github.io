to end</FONT></CENTER></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">It is ironic that the final outcome of the
US Presidential election may depend on the votes from overseas.
American foreign policy is likely to be very different depending on
the ultimate winner. This uncertainty of future US policy may be
compounded by any prolonged wrangle over the legality of the
electoral result. International relations abhors a power vacuum. The
Israel/Palestine conflict worsens by the day, and the US
administration no longer has the power to do anything to help. Over
the coming month, the European Union will be formulating its new
defence posture. Already there are signs of strain between members
over coordinating arrangements with NATO. A leaderless United States
will be an opportunity for those who wish to widen the Atlantic
divide.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">If George W. Bush is finally elected as
President, Europe can expect a rather more chill wind to blow from
the West. Bush advisors have been warning for much of the Summer that
they do not intend to keep American forces in the Balkans. They
suggest that there will be an early announcement of a phased
withdrawal over at most a 3 year period. Since only 20% of troops in
the Balkans are from the US, Europe should be able to fill the gap.
However, the signal is clear: the US may engage in the key
warfighting engagements, but it will not be prepared to use it forces
for the more difficult post-conflict peace building tasks. Despite
the US spending nearly twice as much as the EU on defence, Republican
defence advisors see the need for considerable increases to fund such
projects as National Missile Defence (NMD) and new high technology
weapon systems. Their proposals for NMD will bring them into
confrontation with European governments at an early stage. Nor would
a Bush administration be likely to show any great enthusiasm for the
United Nations. Indeed with both the House and the Senate also
Republican there is a much reduced prospect of the use of force for
humanitarian reasons. Arms control proponents worry about the
direction that may be taken. The United States has already declined
to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and Bush supporters talk
about abrogating the Anti Ballistic Missile Treaty if that is what
needed to make NMD work. However, some offer the hope of a
significant reduction in nuclear weapons if NMD is deployed.</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">If Al Gore manages to snatch victory from
defeat, foreign policy will not just be a continuation of the Clinton
years. Relationships with Europe may be easier than some of the
potential problems of a future Bush Administration. Nevertheless, he
will face opposition in both Houses of Congress, and that will have
been made worse by the fight over electoral legitimacy. Gore does not
appear to have the political skills of Clinton, and this may make it
more difficult for him to establish himself with the rest of the
international community. The major foreign policy challenge for the
new President will be over Israel and Palestine. Here his choice of
Joseph Lieberman as Vice-Presidential candidate will make the honest
broker role more difficult than ever.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In sum, Europe may find itself having to
take more of a lead in international issues however the US Presidency
is resolved. The power vacuum may continue for some time. The divide
between between Democrat and Republican will be great whatever the
ultimate outcome. The confirming process for senior officials may be
even more unpleasant and lengthy than usual. While the US economic
boom seems impervious to political turmoil, even it may be tested. It
will be "interesting times" for us all.</FONT></P>
