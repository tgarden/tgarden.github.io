<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">It was all going so well. Defence was never
seen as a Labour's favourite policy area. Yet George Robertson, as
the new government's Defence Secretary, delivered a strategic review,
which earned the plaudits of the military, parliament, commentators,
NATO and even the Treasury. His analysis was quickly tested by
successful combat operations in Iraq and in Kosovo.  Respected both
at home and abroad, he was a popular choice to move on to the bigger
challenge of sorting out NATO. His successor at the Ministry of
Defence, Geoff Hoon, must wonder why it all seems to be falling apart
now that he is in the hot seat. MoD problems are in the headlines
every week. The army report after Kosovo that their rifles jam and
their radios are useless. A serving Admiral writes to the newspapers
to defend cutbacks in navy activity as normal budget management. The
RAF's newly upgraded Tornados are no longer able to drop the
precision bombs needed in modern warfare. The National Audit Office
is outraged by cost over-runs and delays for new military equipment.
The army is so short of recruits that it is looking in the prisons.
Air force pilots use the internet to vent their frustrations
anonymously. When a real emergency comes in Mozambique, the MoD is
portrayed as putting more efforts into securing full costs from the
aid budget than getting helicopters to Maputo.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Are the defence forces of the United Kingdom
on the point of collapse? How can the string of military successes
over the past decade be squared with the current litany of equipment
failures, manpower shortages, training cuts and bureaucratic
bungling? As Defence is required to become ever more efficient, the
margin for error reduces. The difficulty is to judge when a critical
capability is cut beyond the point of no return.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Since the end of the Cold War, the British
armed forces and their supporting civilians have been reduced by more
than a third in size. . Rather than a reduction in commitments with
the demise of the Soviet Union, British Forces have never been
busier. The costs of military capability rise  faster than do retail
prices. Even if defence budgets were frozen in real terms, there
would be difficult choices to be made each year about spending
priorities. Malcolm Rifkind's review of 1994 tried to cut the costs
of support for the forces so that he could provide more money for
combat capability. George Robertson undertook a comprehensive look at
the military capability needed to support foreign policy. Yet,
unsurprisingly, his review came up with an answer that kept the
defence budget unchanged. He squared the circle of costs by looking
to rationalisation between the three Services. With each new policy
initiative, the armed forces have less resilience. First a cut in
front-line strength, then a transfer of support activities to the
civil market, now a squeeze on efficiency by eliminating duplication
between different arms. All of this will be familiar to the modern
businessman looking for greater productivity and lower overheads.
Yet, despite a move to commercial accounting systems, Defence cannot
operate as though it were a normal business. A factory can be
measured by its output and a chief executive can be ranked by his
company's share price. Armed forces, in the end, are tested against
unforeseen circumstances where the price of failure is very high.
Cutting the margins increases the risk of operational failure.</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Every military planner wants to prepare for
the worst possible case, and will  tend to talk up his requirements.
Governments, with many calls on the public purse,  have to decide how
much risk they are prepared to take. While they will always claim to
be matching commitments to resources, events have a way of overtaking
such aspirations. The Gulf War was no part of the "Options for
Change" planning. Troop cuts did not anticipate future years of
commitments in the Balkans. Planning misjudgements can usually be
corrected for a price, but not always. When equipment plans fail to
live up to expectations, more time and money is often the only
answer. This leaves less cash for troops and training, which can lead
to much more intractable problems. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The army has only recently managed to
achieve recruiting figures which equal the outflow of experienced
troops and officers. They have delayed their target date for full
manning to 2005 at best. The new recruit will take years to acquire
the military expertise of the NCO who leaves early. The RAF is some
95 fast jet pilots short of its requirement for 500. At best, the
position will deteriorate by another 40 over the next three years.
When the Eurofighter is delivered, will there be the pilots to fly
it? Equipment failings steal the headlines. Yet in the end, none of
the equipment is of any use without the trained manpower to operate
it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The rash of leaks and doom-laden forecasts
from the MoD is not unusual around budget time. Some doubtless hope
that this will bring pressure on the government to treat defence more
generously. They can rightly claim new commitments: Robin Cook making
generous offers to a UN standing force last year, and Tony Blair
leading the charge at Helsinki for a better European defence
contribution. In the past, the armed forces would have coped with
these extra tasks from within their establishments, knowing that they
could risk double and triple hatting of forces. Today, with so many
real deployments  and margins much tighter, it is more difficult. No
one can say when, how or if the breaking point will come. Those who
reduced the costs of the military medical services in 1994 did not
expect a melt down 5 years later. For the military, the test is
always an operational one. The UK forces have a very enviable
reputation for success. The signs are that they are now living on
borrowed time. Trained manpower cannot be delivered quickly. </FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The next defence review may be forced on a
reluctant government rather earlier than it would have wished. Nor
will the prospect bring any pleasure to armed forces that are still
coping with the fallout of the last three such reviews. Since it will
be difficult to reduce commitments or to  increase the defence budget
significantly, the government may need to look to rationalisation of
military capability at the European level for its salvation. The
duplication of headquarters, training units and support services
between each of the EU member countries is a rich vein to quarry for
better defence at lower cost.</FONT></P>
