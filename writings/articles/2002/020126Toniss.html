			<h3>The Shock of 11 September</h3>
			<p>The shock of a new kind of threat emerging, seemingly from nowhere on the 11 September, has put many of the certainties about future European security in doubt. It is too soon to say whether, the mass murder at the World Trade Centre attack is an aberration, or is the opening round of a new form of war and insecurity. and how we may now have to change as a result of the terror attacks. We have been passing through a time of great change in our approach to European Security since the end of the Cold War, and this has accelerated over the past three years. The question that I shall explore in my session is whether the rules of the game have changed again. Are the attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon as much a watershed as was the fall of the Wall here in Berlin?<br>
				<br>
				Terrorism is not new. Virtually all governments have had to develop policies to protect their citizens from unpredictable acts of violence by terrorists. Nor did the tragic events of 11 September 2001 in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania change the risk. What changed was the public perception of the threat. It is now real and immediate, particularly for the American public. The USA had been uniquely unaffected by international terrorism in recent years. Yet the warning signals had been there before. The World Trade Centre had already been the target of a failed bombing attack. In Europe, many governments have grown used to the need to counter their own local terrorist problems. A combination of intelligence work and police activity was used to keep the level of violence to a tolerable level until some solution to the underlying problem could be found.</p>
			<h3>The decade of peacekeeping</h3>
			<p>From the end of the Cold War, we could look back, with a degree perhaps of complacency, on a decade of military force being used by the Western powers to promote peace and stability rather than to acquire empire. The Gulf War of 1991, coming so soon after the end of the Cold War was a salutary reminder that the international system continued to need our close attention. The need for military force to right such a clear violation of international law by Iraq, as it invaded Kuwait, was obvious to all. The United Nations authorised the action, and the United States built and led a coalition to expel the invaders. That a major military campaign could be successful with so few casualties set the tone for western military operations for the rest of the decade.<br>
				<br>
				Military staff colleges studied the rules of international law, drew up doctrine for peace keeping, played humanitarian relief instead of war games. Without a perception of direct threat to their territories, governments reduced their expenditure on military activities. The &quot;peace dividend&quot; meant that most European countries cut their combat forces by around 40%. Yet the list of problems that the military were expected to sort out grew longer and longer. There were looming humanitarian crises in the Balkans, in Africa and in Indonesia. The aversion to casualties, particularly in the United States, meant that some problems could not be solved. Somalia was abandoned when 17 American soldiers died. The massacres in Central Africa were not stopped, as the prospect of involving western ground forces was too distasteful. Where sanitised warfare was possible, action was taken. The doctrine of overwhelming force, attributed to Colin Powell when he was the senior US general, developed into the practice of using the air force to win wars and ground troops to go in later and administer the post conflict rebuilding of damaged states. We Europeans tried other means in the early stages of the break up of Yugoslavia, when we put in troops on the ground to provide humanitarian aid. But US military power and political sensitivity led them to the use of air power to bring an uneasy peace to Bosnia, and also to solve the situation in Kosovo.<br>
				<br>
				This high technology American approach to warfare has caused difficulties in Europe. The USA is the only nation with such capabilities, and Europe remains fragmented in its approach to defence. The wars, before September 11, that we have been engaged upon are often called &quot;wars of choice&quot;., although I would argue that there was little choice for us as far as the Balkans were concerned. As the gap between European and American military capability widens, the choice for European nations may more often be one of non-involvement. This in turn has led to a frustration in America. Already there was little US enthusiasm for the United Nations, and the Kosovo conflict will have shown some that war can be conducted without the explicit approval of the UN. The election of the second President Bush was seen by many as presaging a new more self-interested America. But the signs were already there in the Clinton years. The world was already frustrated by US antipathy to arms control, to international agreements, and to its belief in extra-territorial powers. President Bush reinforced this perception with his rejection of the Kyoto agreement on greenhouse gas emissions, his desire for Ballistic missile defences come what may, his rejection of an International Criminal Court and so on.<br>
				<br>
				Some believe that this would be the end of big wars that characterised the 20th Century. Yet, the Korean peninsular is frozen in time with forces at very high states of readiness. The United States has large forces in place in South Korea. China is even more focused on reclaiming Taiwan, now that its other territories have returned. Would the US allow Taiwan to be swallowed up by military means? The security situation is Israel is very bad now, but has been a concern for years. It is not 11 September which has brought nuclear weapons to Israel, India and Pakistan, and has pushed Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia and North Korea into developing their own weapons of mass destruction. All these things were happening before, and the United States has, up until now, been unwilling to see how the international system could be used to best effect to reduce these real risks of major conflict. However the dynamics of the war on terrorism has changed the situation in these difficult regions. We cannot yet know whether for good or ill.</p>
			<h3>Europe's Role</h3>
			<p>In Europe, we seem to be heading (whether by design or accident is not clear) to a state where we let the United States take the lead in military power projection, while Europe looks after the &quot;soft security&quot; issues of development aid, good government, environmental issues and support for UN activities. Unfortunately such a division of tasks is neither practical nor I would argue desirable. US foreign policy is clear in its aim, which is to support the US national interest. Many would say, is that not the way every country shapes its foreign policy? Perhaps the question is whether the national interest is seen with a short or long time horizon. Thus it may be in the US short term economic interest to fight Kyoto, but it will not be in the world's (and hence the US's ) long term interest to ignore the environment. Support of the International Criminal Court requires some giving up of national sovereignty in the short term, in order to benefit from fewer genocidal despots in the long term. It would also make the handling of the new mass killers like bin Laden much easier. The abrogation of the Anti Ballistic Missile treaty, the failure to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the ignoring of the landmine convention or the discarding of the Biological Weapons Protocol may all have good national interest justifications in the United States, but the national approach does not contribute to greater global security.<br>
				<br>
				Europe can try to follow a path towards greater international co-operation and investment in the developing world to raise standards of education, living and democracy. When the United States decides to isolate North Korea or Iran as pariah states, Europe can keep the channels open for when they are needed (as they have been just recently with Iran). However this divisive transatlantic approach cannot work. The EU of 15 countries has a GDP as large as the US. It is more populous. It is going to grow to perhaps twice the size over the next two decades. Europe has global interests, and needs all the levers, political diplomatic, economic and military to underpin those interests. The EU has done remarkably well in developing all the structures for being a major world player except in the field of foreign and security policy. The imbalance between US and European military capabilities are seen every day within NATO. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation may appear to some to be a strange hang over from the Cold War. Yet it is the only working military alliance in the world. When the UN wanted to conduct a difficult and demanding operation, as it did in the Gulf, the ad hoc coalition of nations under US leadership operated to NATO procedures. The same was true for the Kosovo operation. Yet the US did not enjoy the consultations needed during the Kosovo air campaign, and that affected how it has conducted the Afghanistan operation.<br>
				<br>
				If NATO is to thrive, and I would argue we need it more than ever for the global security tasks that are emerging, it cannot be an unequal organisation made up of the US and the also-rans. Europe has a role to play as an equal partner with the United States. By developing its military capability, Europe can make NATO more effective, can promote the wider global agenda in discussions with the US, and can feel that its voice is heard in the decision making process.<br>
				<br>
				None of this is impossible. The amount that the EU nations spend so inefficiently on their defence totals some Euro 170 billion per year. They duplicate everything between them with tiny research establishments, multiple headquarters, under-utilised infrastructure and protected national defence industries. If monetary union was the vision for Europe over the past twenty years, the new vision needs to be a common foreign policy supported by efficient military and diplomatic structures.<br>
				The question must now be how will the events since 11 September affect Europe's role? Will the advantages of a global approach to terrorism, make the US more internationalist? Will the perception of new threats, make the Europeans more willing to give up sovereignty in order to play a stronger role in security matters? Have we a real opportunity to change the international structure to provide a better and safer world for not just the rich countries?</p>
			<h3>The costs</h3>
			<p>The military planners in London and in Bonn and now Berlin have not been good at predicting the future, We failed to predict the Falklands, the Gulf War, the fallout from the break&#150;up of Yugoslavia, and now the terror attacks on America. I would add to that list of failures, our surprise at the speed and way in which the Cold War ended. In the dark days of the Cold War, the prospect of a war between NATO and the Warsaw Pact was so awful that we (the nations of the West) were prepared to field quite significant military forces at considerable cost. In the UK we thought nothing of spending 5% of our gross national product every year on defence. On that scale, we could cope with lesser challenges when they popped up. Now, the situation is very different. We grudge spending even half that proportion of our national budget on armed forces.<br>
				<br>
				A public document - called the Future Strategic Context for Defence &#150; was published by the UK MOD in February this year. This document concluded that the worst case contingency for the planners is a British contribution to a war on the scale of the Gulf War. It discounts a direct military threat to the UK. Yet the author cautions that the analysis cannot predict shocks &#150; &quot;low probability events with a dramatic impact&quot;. The co-ordinated attacks on Washington and New York with mass casualties and an unseen enemy are presumably just such a shock. We cannot know how events will play out on the international scene over the next five years. It may be that we have moved back into an era of risk and vulnerability like the one that we lived through in the Cold War, where such attacks with mass casualties become a regular feature. What is clear to me is that the risks of security failure increase as we in Europe allow our military and other security capabilities to atrophy. We are demanding much from our troops today: in Bosnia, Kosovo, Macedonia, over Iraq, in East Timor, Sierra Leone, and now over Afghanistan. At home, we turn to them for help in flooding or in foot and mouth. Our own terrorist threat in Ireland still absorbs them (although that now looks more hopeful), and to all of that is added the new international terror threat. In Germany you too are finding the difficulties of resourcing military capabilities for a growing number of tasks. These are dramatic times.<br>
				<br>
				This phenomenon is repeated to a greater or lesser extent throughout the rest of Europe. I see the possibility of some relief if Europe can work together in a serious way to produce real usable military capability, but I fear that it won't. I worry for all the reasons that I have covered about the changing nature of our relationship with the United States. They will rightly expect us to do more as they take on additional burdens. The instabilities which might lead to big wars will still need to be addressed. But we need also to consider how we approach the additional requirements of the new counter-terrorist campaign.</p>
			<h3>The Counter-Terrorist Campaign</h3>
			<p>Terrorism was with us long before 11 September 2001, some of it motivated by local political aims, some by single issue fanaticism, and some by unfathomable beliefs. Suicide bombers were not new. What is different is the targeting on a global scale of targets designed to cause casualties without limit and to undermine the global economy. They might be called strategic acts of destruction, rather than the tactical terrorist acts of the past. While it may have been possible for the international community to live with occasional acts of local terrorism around the world, it is not possible to live with non-state actors who have a mission to destroy the global system.<br>
				<br>
				The most effective approach remains very much the same as in more traditional counter-terrorist campaigns, and these are unfortunately well known over the past century to UK and German security forces. The priority must be to defend the most vulnerable targets and to arrest the in-place operatives before they can carry out new atrocities. These are jobs which belong primarily to the intelligence and police agencies around the world. Sharing information on a global basis is the only way to respond to a global threat. The lead taken by the European leaders in shuttle diplomacy will have contributed to setting up these linkages. The EU structures are proving invaluable in this co-operation.<br>
				<br>
				The second priority in defence terms (but it is rapidly becoming the first priority in political terms) is finding and eliminating the direct supporting infrastructure of the sponsor of terrorism. This is always difficult, but is especially so when head office was located in the wild country of Afghanistan. The use of $2 million cruise missiles to take out a camel and a tent was a real problem. Nevertheless given good intelligence, carefully targeted air attacks and small but capable western ground forces, co-operating with indigenous forces, the bin Laden infrastructure has been effectively dismantled within the borders of Afghanistan. Some European states had useful niche capabilities in intelligence gathering, and in specialist operations which can be helpful to what is inevitably primarily a US effort. Capturing bin Laden himself continues to depend on good luck as much as anything. The security problem in Afghanistan is now more about rebuilding it to be a functioning state for the future, rather than its role as a source of terrorists. Indeed it is recovering failed states that will be the long term answer. The indirect support by States of terrorist organisations requires many different approaches. The circumstances in Afghanistan are now right to make life better for the people and thus stop the growth of yet more recruits for international terrorism. Certainly providing a government that can bring the rule of law and dispense humanitarian aid must be a priority, and it will be a role in which a significant international military presence is likely to be needed for some time. The UN will have to take the lead, but the EU will have an important contribution to make in military, civilian and and financial contributions. All of these will be to improve long term European security.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				Success in the military campaign has not removed the threat from the already trained and deployed terrorists. Bringing al-Qaeda members, captured in Afghanistan, to justice is important, but we should not delude ourselves that the world will return to normal just because we have done that. Indeed if we do not do that in a way which appears fair and just to the rest of the world, we may make the situation worse in the future. Observation of international law norms is an obligation on all nations, including the US.</p>
			<h3>Domestic Implications</h3>
			<p>The academic community has been warning of the new age of asymmetric warfare since the end of the Cold War. Critics of expensive high tech military capability (exemplified by national missile defence) have warned that western powers are increasingly vulnerable to unsophisticated attacks by determined non-state actors. The weapon of the terrorist has been the crude bomb for more than a century, and yet its effectiveness has increased as commercial and government infrastucture becomes more complex. But the assumption has been that terrorists will tailor their actions to further their political ambitions. This calculus changes if the aim of the terrorist is entirely the destruction of western society.<br>
				<br>
				The events of Tuesday 11 September demonstrated that it is now posiible to cause mass destruction (in the technical sense of thousands of immediate casualties), economic panic and the dispersal of the main organs of government with no more than a Stanley knife. The skies are filled with thousands of airliners at any given moment. The dangers of aircraft crashes from normal operating risks are well understood. Every flight safety precaution is taken in ensuring that each aircraft is properly serviced and operated through an international certification system. The risks of acts of terrorism directed against civil airliners and their passengers are also well known. Disasters still happen as the Lockerbie bombing demonstrated. Hijacks are much less frequent than in the past, but still occur from time to time. The measures which the international community some twenty years ago took in the light of a rash of hijacks and threats to aircraft safety have been reasonably effective. The measures have been multi-faceted. The intelligence community has devoted its efforts to counter-terrorism. Airport preventitive security measures have become near universal. Hand baggage is scanned, passengers pass through metal detectors, luggage in the hold is examined, and vetting measures for airport personnel have been strengthened. Nations have agreed to deal with every case of hijacking in a severe way, so that potential future hijackers are deterred. While none of these measures provides total assurance, the overall effect has been a considerable decline in such incidents in recent years.<br>
				<br>
				The use of a hijacked airliner as a weapon of mass destruction is a new and devastating development. Deterrent measures can have little effect on fanatics who rejoice in their own death. The focus must therefore be on preventative measures for the future. The elimination (if it is possible) of those behind the events of 11 September will not stop others attempting to emulate this terrible example. Indeed, we should be concerned that copy cat incidents by deranged people may now be an additional risk. The US has even seen one such event in Florida already with the young boy piloting his light aircraft into a tall building.<br>
				<br>
				While measures such as these can address the suicidal aircraft attacks, they do nothing to reduce other major terrorist threats. The perpetrators of the 11 September atrocities are different from the traditional terrorist group who seek to use threats to make political gains. In this case the terror is an end in itself. The destruction of western power is the motivation. This means that we must expect other means to be used, regardless of the potential number of casualties. Biological weapons attack becomes a real and urgent threat, and the delivery means may be by a single person willing to die for the cause. Against such threats deterrence and retribution have little hope of success. Radiological attacks (that is causing the spread of radioactive substances) are also likely.<br>
				<br>
				In the military and diplomatic field a difficult two pronged approach will be necessary. The remaining members of this terror group must be identified and removed from action. At the same time, the attractions of becoming a member of such a group must be reduced. A large scale disproportionate military response will generate many new recruits for the terrorists, as Israel has found over the last year. Good intelligence is the key to any operation. In order to get intelligence quickly, the West will need to seek the co-operation of the states which have in the past hosted terrorist factions. This will be a difficult trick to turn. If the whereabouts of the perpetrators are identified, the whole international community can move effectively. An alliance of many nations would support the USA in taking necessary action to extradite, eliminate or capture those responsible. If a more general military campaign is launched against those states, which NATO classifies as supporters of terrorism, then the outcome will be much less satisfactory. Whatever the outcome of such a campaign, the world will be a less safe place for everyone in the future. Difficult as it is, this is a time to build alliances and take joint action as American, European, Arab, Asian and African partners against a universal threat.<br>
				<br>
				We also need to take measures at the local level to reduce the risks, and also manage the consequences when an attack is successful. As members of the business community, you have an important role. I trust you already have safe redundant arrangements for preserving your electronic data from destruction. Do you take as much care with preserving your equally important asset of your people? Evacuation drills for buildings need to be taken seriously, and practiced properly. Training in first aid is important. It may even be if such attacks become more frequent, companies will need to move towards more dispersed operations with key workers separated physically. We are not at that stage yet. We are all going to find that life is more difficult in terms of security checks. Getting the balance right is difficult. Security checks are to make you more secure, not to keep up appearances.<br>
				<br>
				Governments have a problem with tackling the new threat. Most of the measures to be taken are best kept secret. Yet the public needs to be reassured. Getting the balance between risk and freedom right is another problem.</p>
			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>This has been a very wide ranging talk. I have looked at the global, the regional, the national and the local business aspects of security after the 11 September. None of the security issues that were worrying us before the terror attacks have gone away, and many have given rise to the conditions that allows failed states and safe bases for international terrorism. Perhaps we wasted the decade after the end of the Cold War. Germany was focused on its enormous and expensive project of reunification; the UK had its problems in Ireland to solve. Europe worried about the Balkans. Yet all the time things have been getting worse in Africa, parts of Central Asia, and now we have real possibilities of war in Israel and in the Indian sub-continent.<br>
				<br>
				We share the world with each other as never before. We live in a common environment, where the actions of one state can effect the world. Information is universal and instantaneous. Economies are no longer controlled nationally. We need to develop, reform and use the international institutions of the world for if we fail to do so we had better batten down the hatches and be prepared for much more spending on security. We can use the current opportunity to build a consensus for a Marshall Plan for the Globe; but that means that Europe must act together. We have the resources to provide the aid, the diplomatic effort and the security forces that will be necessary. This is a great challenge for the EU, and Germany and the UK must be among the leading players.<br>
