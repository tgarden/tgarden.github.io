			<h4>&nbsp;Gulf War Syndrome and the Lloyd Report</h4>
			<h4>Unstarred Question &#150; 21 December 2004&nbsp;</h4>
			<p>My lords, it is becoming embarrassing to acknowledge that I once worked for that Kremlin-like institution, the Ministry of Defence.&nbsp; There is a strange paradox between the ethos of the MOD and that of the individual armed services. In the army, navy and air force, we are trained to look after our people both in peace and war. The duty of care extends from the top to the bottom.&nbsp; The fierceness of the debates over particular regiments in recent days is a reflection of centuries of loyalty both from men to their regiment, and the regiment to their men. We have such good armed forces because they know that they can rely on their comrades and their leadership.</p>
			<p>Yet what have we seen from the MOD in recent times? Whether justly or not, the reputation is one of cover-up, lack of transparency and unwillingness to support the troops when they are in distress. In my short time in this House, I have heard the Government front benches stonewall over the need for a public inquiry into the allegations about abuse at Deepcut; change the balance of evidence needed for service disablity pensions; introduce redundancy schemes as our armed forces are involved in global operations.&nbsp; Grieving families report time and time again the difficulties in getting information from the MOD. The MOD still ignores the recommendations of your Lordships house over the tragic accident to the Chinook which crashed into the Mull of Kintyre.</p>
			<p>This is not good for recruiting, for retention or for the morale of armed forces. They need to know that when we send them off to dangerous but vital tasks, that we will give them every help before, during and after&nbsp; the operation. This means a duty of care in terms of protection, be it body armour or as in to day's debate vaccination.&nbsp; Those of us who have been subject to military innoculation understand how mistakes may occur in the desire to protect against every possibility, particularly when things have to be done at short notice. During operations, the implications of&nbsp; exposure to other agents, be they pesticides, atmospheric pollutants or hostile warfare substances may not be fully appreciated at the time. All this is understandable. What is impossible to understand is the unwillingness of the MOD subsequently to be as helpful as possible to use every means to find causes and reassure people in the services and their families.</p>
			<p>In looking at illness caused by service in the first Gulf War, the Defence Select Committee reported in 1995 that: &ldquo;In responding to the allegations of Gulf War syndrome, the MOD has been quick to deny but slow to investigate. &ldquo; They went on to say that &ldquo;The MOD&rsquo;s response had been reactive rather than proactive and characterised throughout by scepticism and defensiveness and&nbsp; general torpor.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Nine years on, the MOD refused to take part in the independent public inquiry under Lord Lloyd of Berwick. The excellent report from this inquiry catalogues the continuing feelings of resentment towards the MOD for its handling of this sensitive issue. The inquiry gives simple answers to the questions which have caused so much distress to so many veterans and their families. It confirms that those that are receiving war ensions and gratuities are ill, that their illness was caused by service in the Gulf, it identifies the likely causes and confirms that the illness is rightly described as a syndrome &#150; Gulf War Syndrome in fact. Other countries have suffered similar problems, and that our sick veterans remain unsatisfied with their treatment.</p>
			<p>The Lloyd report lists 4 simple recommendations at para 283 which they believe could go far to restore trust and confidence. These are that the MOD should acknowledge that it was service in the Gulf which caused the illness, that Gulf War Syndrome is an appropriate description, that a fund for ex-gratia payments should be set up, and that the 272 rejected claims should be reviewed.</p>
			<p>I do not doubt that the noble Lord, the Minister will again today give us an unhelpful reply. Those who believe that they are suffering from Gulf War Syndrome will continue to feel aggrieved. The reputation of the MOD as a good employer will take another knock. And perhaps most importantly, getting closer to an objective truth about the undoubted illnesses of many of our veterans will have been deferred again. Will the Minister just explain what cause is served by this intransigence? I trust that it is not a financial consideration. If we have damaged our servicemen, even while trying to protect them, we must ensure that we recognise that and take appropriate remedial action.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Finally, given the ever worsening image of the MOD, could the noble Lord the Minister undertake to consult with his colleagues more widely about promoting a new culture of openness and public awareness within the Department?&nbsp; Perhaps the culture of secrecy on operational security matters has become too extended. The MOD needs to take a more enlightened view of its responsibilities for its people.</p>
