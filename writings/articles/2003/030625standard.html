			<p><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">The tragic news of the deaths of 6 British military policemen, and the injuries to 8 Paras on patrol in a separate incident, has reminded us that the war in Iraq continues. The US have been only too aware of this as they have been taking daily casualties since President Bush declared major combat operations at an end on 1 May. Why does it seem to be going wrong? A series of strategic errors have made a difficult post-conflict operation even more problematic.<br>
					<br>
					The very success of the warfighting phase is a part of the problem. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld pushed for a strategy which depended on precision air strikes to allow the use of fewer ground troops. That worked reasonably well during the war, but left a real problem with the transition to peace. Securing the country and making it safe for aid agencies, engineers and civil administrators required many more troops than were available. <br>
					<br>
					Even so, it might have been possible to make progress. But mistake number two was to change the senior US administration in Iraq just as it was beginning work. Whatever the merits of Jay Garner (who returned home) as against Paul Bremmer (who was sent out to start again), valuable time was lost. A sense of order and counter-order leads to a lack of confidence among potential Iraqi leaders.<br>
					<br>
					The sense of uncertainty has been compounded by the  indefinite deferment of an interim Iraqi administration. This third mistake means that US and UK forces will appear increasingly as occupying forces rather than liberators. This will swell the numbers of supporters for hostile elements.<br>
					<br>
					In such difficult times, it was amazing that Bremmer then decided to disband the Iraqi army overnight. An army without a job, without pay, without a future but with heavy weaponry is likely to become another security problem to worry about. In a partial reversal of this fourth mistake, it has now been decided to pay the out of work for the time being, and give a promise that some will be recruited for border guard duties.<br>
					<br>
					This lack of direction and poor decision making has certainly made life difficult for the military. There are a number of possible sources of threat apart from disbanded troops. Saddam&#146;s fedayeen will take every opportunity to practise their unconventional warfare techniques. Local militias may support particular power groups. Ordinary citizens fear the armed criminals who can range freely in some areas. There are undoubtedly also neighbouring states and groups who have an interest in destabilising Iraq if it is to become a base for future US operations. Already Syrians have been targeted in cross border US operations, and it is also likely that Iranian groups will be helping their Shia colleagues in the south. So far, Turkey seems to have restrained itself from any action in the Kurdish north of the country.<br>
					<br>
					The question now is what should and can be done, and how long will it all take? No real progress on the rebuilding can be made until there is a reasonable level of countrywide security. This certainly requires more troops. Whatever British Defence Secretary, Geoff Hoon, says about being prepared to up the number of our soldiers, there are very few available. As the outgoing Chief of Defence Staff, Admiral Sir Michael Boyce, warned, we have been asking too much of our military and it cannot sustain so many commitments. Even the US military are worried about how they can cope with replacement of their forces in Iraq. We are continuing to use Territorial Army reservists and that will give us longer term retention problems. We now have to think of a serious military commitment for years rather months. The Balkans have shown how long it takes to make the transition.<br>
					<br>
					The longer the problem is left festering, the more difficult and intractable it will become. We have seen in Afghanistan what happens if the country is not secured after the bombing finishes. If the US and the UK cannot provide enough troops, they must seek help from allies. Poland is already trying to do this through NATO for its small sector. It is a pity that a proper alliance was not built before going into Iraq, but that is a party of the sorry history of the rush to war. Now the world needs to act together to rebuild Iraq for a peaceful future. Before that can happen the US will need to eat a little humble pie and ask for help. Tony Blair can use his role of loyal friend by telling George Bush that it is time to return to the international system. Even the world&#146;s hyperpower cannot do everything on its own.</font></p>
