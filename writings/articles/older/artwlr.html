<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>There are those who question the very logic of a concept of the
laws of war. War is such a violent and terrible undertaking, that it
seems beyond the calm rational structure of a legal code. In the
minds of others, such a regime suggests the complex customs of
ancient knights with their code of chivalry. The cynics claim that
prosecutions for war crimes are always of the vanquished by the
victor and that this makes for an unjust form of legislation.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The laws of war are different in nature from domestic laws, and
also from the normal range of international law. There is no single
legislature to agree the rules of war and no standing police force to
catch the law breakers. Yet no state can afford to ignore the
international consensus on the laws of war, whether as the aggressor
nation or the defending power. Nor is it possible to cobble together
a suitable set of rules as each war breaks out. The soldiers need
guidance as to the legality of their actions, and they need long
training so that the implications of the rules of war become second
nature. The planners need to procure military equipment many years
before it is delivered into service. It could be less than sensible
to invest both time and money in the development of a weapon system,
if its use would be a criminal act in the eyes of the world
community. Political leaders need also to be aware of the constraints
of the international laws of war.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Again, the sceptic may laugh. A statesman intent on war is
unlikely to be constrained by the customs of the world community on
the laws of war. A military scientist, who discovers a more effective
way of incapacitating the opposition, will be able to persuade the
arms manufacturers to invest in his new weapon. The military man will
not wish to fight with one hand tied behind his back. Taking these
three books together provides some of the answers to these doubts.
The first explains the development and current compass of the laws of
war, and highlights the failures as well as the successes. The other
two give graphic examples of the inhumanity and needless catastrophe
that flow from lack of observance of even the most basic humanitarian
laws.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Professor Best is not a lawyer by training but a historian, and
his book War &amp; Law since 1945 is a description of the development
of the thinking, practice and effectiveness of laws about conflict.
Indeed, he makes it clear that lawyers should read the book for
pleasure, but not as the preparation for academic examinations on
International Law. The spread of international agreement on
humanitarian law has been mainly a twentieth century phenomenon.
Reflecting this (and his title) only one chapter is allocated to
events from the dawn of time to 1945.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>He dates the codification of the laws and customs of war from the
regulation of maritime commerce in wartime, which was dealt with in
1856. Land warfare codes followed in quick succession, and by the
turn of the century a set of such regulations was annexed to the
Hague Conventions. In parallel, work was developed on codification of
practices for the sick and wounded. International agreement on simple
humanitarian arrangements was agreed in the Geneva Convention of
1864.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The third pillar of such laws was to be the question of the
involvement of non-combatants in war. Here Best describes why the
development of a legal framework seems to have been rather less tidy.
While the St. Petersburg declaration of 1868 indicated that the only
legitimate object in war was the weakening of the military forces of
the enemy, there was no explicit ban on attacking civilians.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The test of these new humanitarian laws was to come with World War
1. While many of the rules were broken, or bent beyond recognition,
it was a war in which the belligerents all presumed the validity of
the laws of war, and could thus accuse each other of contraventions.
Yet, largely, the humanitarian rules for care of the injured and
prisoner of war procedures worked well. The Red Cross gained greater
influence through its work, and was able to take on an agreed role in
later conventions. The horrors of that war however meant that the
thrust of the interwar period was the prevention of war rather than
the patching up of the laws of war. Best makes the point that if the
League of Nations is to be criticised for not having done more to
reaffirm and reinforce the law of war, one must remember that it had
the higher aim of making such laws redundant.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Despite such hopes, wars continued and the next major test of the
laws of war came with World War 2. In this, Best judges, perhaps
over-generously, that the core principles of restraint and
discrimination for the sake of humanity were observed not badly when
men had the will and space to observe them. He deduces two lessons
from this period: firstly, the willingness to risk extra losses for
humanitarian principle is rare; and second, the prospect of war
trials has little effect on the actions of belligerents.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The second part of the book turns to the reconstruction of the
laws of war between 1945 and 1950. The birth of the United Nations
Organisation was the key event. Best makes the point that the laws of
war would have continued to operate without the UN, but the UN
Charter was the hub of the post-war reconstruction of the
international legal apparatus. He paints a fascinating picture of the
development of humanitarian law. The difficulties of negotiation over
a large range of Conventions are well documented in the book. A good
example is the push to define the distinction between combatant and
non-combatant in a war: a problem that continues in modern warfare.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>More successful was the development in 1949 of a comprehensive
prisoner of war Convention. The 143 articles and five annexes
provided a complete code of conduct for the handling of POWs. This
has been a useful and important agreement. While there have been
transgressions against the code in recent times, world opinion is
quick to condemn them as we saw in the Gulf War.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In the final part, covering the period from 1950, his examples are
comprehensive. He sketches the increasing concern over the use of
Napalm as a legitimate weapon from Korea, through Algeria, Angola,
Mozambique and of course in Vietnam. This is one illustration of the
difficulties of agreeing humanitarian law. Similarly, limitations on
the use of mines have become an issue as more civilian casualties
occur long after wars have ceased.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In the Epilogue to the book, Professor Best gives a personal and
subjective assessment of the place of international humanitarian law
in the scheme of inter-State relationships today. He describes how,
over twenty years of study, he has moved from being impressed by the
moral and religious seriousness of the underlying ideas to a much
more critical position. He now has a much more limited expectation of
the efficacy of international humanitarian law.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In his wide ranging treatise, Best makes only a passing mention of
the UN Genocide Convention of 1948. He faults it, as with other
aspects of humanitarian law because of difficulty of enforcement.
George Andreopoulous, in his edited collection of papers on all
aspects of genocide, reprints the Convention in full, and his
contributors examine the strengths and weaknesses. The case studies
include the use of chemical weapons by the Iraqis against the Kurds,
East Timor after the Indonesian invasion, and Cambodia under the
Khmer Rouge. These are useful examples to explore both the definition
of genocide and the utility of international law. As is often the
case with such conference collections, the conclusion is provided in
the editor's introduction. Andreopoulous does not disagree with
Best's views on the limited effectiveness of such legislation. He
does however offer the hope that the international community is now
showing a willingness to rethink its approach towards a
people-centred security regime rather than a state-centred system.
This carries with it a need to be prepared to carry out UN-sponsored
intervention to police humanitarian illegal acts.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>For the reader, who has by now become thoroughly depressed over
the inadequacies of international humanitarian law, the third volume
Child Soldiers offers little comfort. Again, an area which is
mentioned briefly by Professor Best is expanded into a detailed
appraisal of the international law relevant to children in armed
conflict, and the impact of such law. What makes this volume
different is that the analytical prose is interspersed with
photographs that would move the hardest heart. Each young child,
weighed down with the trappings of modern weapons, makes a convincing
argument for the need for a more effective international humanitarian
law regime.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Professor Goodwin-Gill and Ilene Cohn are perhaps less forceful in
their conclusions. They argue for more research and upgrading of the
law. They see the wider understanding of the laws about children in
armed conflict, coupled with more monitoring and reporting, as being
the way forward. I doubt that Professor Best would feel that this was
enough.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>These are three books that show clearly the need for laws of war,
and also the difficulties in both agreeing those laws and enforcing
them. Each highlights the lack of adherence when times get difficult,
as they always do in war. That said, as Professor Best admits,
international humanitarian law makes war less terrible than it would
be without it. I would go further. For regular military men, it
provides an important template for conduct in war. Increasingly, it
provides a basis for judgement by the world's media. When an atrocity
occurs, it is judged as such against the customs of humanitarian law.
With sufficient international outrage, an ad hoc intervention may be
mounted by the United Nations to restore the area to a tolerable
state. This surely is the current development in the path to a more
effective rule of international humanitarian law.</P>
