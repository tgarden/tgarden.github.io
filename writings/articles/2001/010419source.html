			<h3>A very Swedish Presidency</h3>
			<p>By Sir Timothy Garden</p>
		</div>
		<p>After the fanfare, and to some extent failure, of the French presidency of the EU in the second half of last year, it was a relief to see sensible Sweden taking the chair. Their launch document, Programme of the Swedish EU Presidency, is austere and anonymous. No glossy brochure with a smiling photograph of the Prime Minister (ten points if you remembered his name: G&ouml;ran Persson). No headline catching promises. The nearest that we get to a sound bite is the focus on the &#147;3 E&#146;s&#148;: Enlargement, Employment and Environment. These were three fairly safe areas for agreement among members. <br>
			<br>
			The enlargement process is supported by all the EU member states, but the process has been very slow. The Nice summit of December 2000 was supposed to sort out the new institutional arrangements for an enlarged Union, but fudged many of the necessary reforms. Sweden has made getting on with the detailed negotiations with applicant countries a priority, looking to welcome new members from the end of next year onwards. This is a pretty challenging target, and not one that was much discussed at the Stockholm conference at the end of March.<br>
			<br>
			Employment was an area for self congratulation among EU leaders at their Swedish summit. Over the next ten years, Europe had agreed: &#147;to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion.&#148; A growth rate of 3.5% over the past year and some 2.5 million new jobs was taken as evidence that the EU was on course for this target. On reporting back to parliament, Tony Blair could not resist adding that there had been 1 million new jobs in Britain since 1997.<br>
			<br>
			Environment is a very Swedish issue, but has swung much more into focus as a result of the various environmentally damaging policies which seem to have been emerging from the USA since Sweden found itself in the chair. Although the presidency programme had anticipated the environmental and sustainability issues being taken at the June European Council meeting in G&ouml;teborg, the dumping of the Kyoto protocol by Bush pushed it up the Stockholm agenda. As the final declaration said of the European Council: &#147;It reaffirms its strong commitment to the Kyoto Protocol as the basis for such action and expresses its<br>
			deep concern at the fact that this Protocol is being called into question.&#148; This is a more robust Europe acting as a global player. We now seeing it conducting diplomacy to isolate the USA over its approach to Kyoto.<br>
			<br>
			Perhaps the fourth &#147;E&#148; that the Swedes should have acknowledged was a focus on External Affairs. Kyoto has not been the only issue over which the EU has been flexing its muscles. Much effort was given to engaging with Russia during the Stockholm summit, and President Putin was invited. Accession by Russia to the World Trade Organization  was identified as a key target. The engagement approach was also seen as important for dealings with North Korea, and the Council agreed to extending its diplomatic efforts in the Korean peninsula. The Balkans policy was also reviewed and support and rebuilding programmes were endorsed. A key declaration of support for Macedonia was an important part of the final documentation. In a little reported conclusion, the leaders at the summit tasked Javier Solana with looking at the Israel-Palestine conflict and reporting back by June on how the EU &#147;can play an enhanced role in promoting the resumption of the peace process.&#148; So whether it is Kyoto, Russia, Korea, Macedonia or Israel we are beginning to see a more assertive European foreign policy, which is prepared to take a different line from the US when necessary.<br>
			<br>
			Reporting back on the Stockholm meeting, Tony Blair had a comparatively easy ride in parliament. The opposition were for once reasonably happy with EU proposals on freeing up the financial services market across Europe. They also welcomed the support for Macedonia. What might have been a useful debate on the growth of the EU as a global foreign policy player became a discussion on the problems of Foot and Mouth disease. The dog that did not bark was the Euro. In Stockholm nobody was much interested as the work was all done and the Euro notes and coins begin circulating in January. In the UK, with an election so soon, Tony Blair was happy to keep it off the agenda.<br>
