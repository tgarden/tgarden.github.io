<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The European Union summit meeting at Nice
should be a gathering which will live on as one of the EU milestones.
It will mark the end of the six month term of the French Presidency,
and should focus on shaping the EU for a future of many more members.
The enlargement from 15 member states to possibly as many as 28
requires some bold changes to the way the EU runs itself. However 
the necessary changes will cause domestic political difficulties for
many of the national leaders, who gather in the South of France. For
once, it is not the UK which will be the only country tobe in
trouble. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">If a larger Union is to be able to work, the
Commission cannot just grow and grow. It is already unwieldy with 20
commissioners. Every country has at least one post, and the big five
(France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK) have two each. The small
countries are reluctant to lose these important posts, while the five
are reluctant to demoted to an equal footing with the smaller states.
The tabloids will be waiting to tell publics that the loss of a
commissioner is a loss of influence. An offset might be made by
adjusting the weighting of votes in the Council of Ministers to
ensure that big states are not swamped by smaller. The current
arrangement, where the smallest state, Luxembourg, has two votes and
the four largest countries (France, Germany and Italy) have ten votes
will need refining if the prospective new members are not to be given
undue influence. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">It looks as though the votes will be trebled
to allow a more discriminating range of vote allocation. It will also
allow all leaders (or their spin doctors)  to claim that they have
increased their votes. There is a move to tie the new votes more
closely to the population of each country. This would give Germany
more votes than any other state. This is a very deep psychological
problem for France. It is also easy to imagine how the Sun headline
writers would react to such a move. Some Germans are now beginning to
realise that such a direct connection between voting power and
population size may not be in their long term interest. Germany's
population is set to decline, and Turkey is a prospective member in
the longer term. Germany might regret setting the rules so that
Turkey ends up as the most powerful country in the EU of 2050.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Even if the weighting of the votes is
settled, the way that they are used remains an issue. Qualified
Majority Voting (QMV) would allow Europe to work better at adapting
to the new challenges of a larger region. Italy is enthusiastic for
making most decisions open to QMV. France has proposed a number of
issues which would move from needing consensus to being decided by
QMV. The UK will not agree to losing its veto on taxation and social
security changes. Germany has difficulties with immigration policies.
France worries about cultural issues. There is little chance of a
bold move on QMV, but the papers will hype up every concession into a
major political disaster.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">If these big problems are not enough to keep
the leaders (or their officials) up late into the night, then the
obscure concept of Enhanced Co-operation and the Charter of
Fundamental Rights will.  The first is seen by some as a way to allow
the more enthusiastic EU members to make more rapid process in
particular fields. This already happens unofficially: the group of 12
who have adopted the Euro are one such subset. The UK would be very
unhappy if they achieved formal treaty status. The Charter of Rights
is another problem for Tony Blair as it might extend the range of law
from the EU to a politically uncomfortable extent. At least he will
be able to take comfort from the fact that European defence proposals
have now got a majority of the British public supporting them.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The outcome of this overfull agenda is
inevitably going to be a fudge. Decisions, which can be put off, will
be put off. Difficult restructuring of the EU will have to wait for
another day. What may be needed is some thought about the need for an
Inter-Governmental Conference to sort it out before the new members
come in. The agenda for such a conference, in perhaps 2004, will need
formulation soon. Nice may be the time to start thinking about
it.</FONT></P>
