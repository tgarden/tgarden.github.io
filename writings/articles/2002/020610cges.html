			<h3>Strategic Rationale</h3>
			<p>In a succession of high profile statements, the US administration has made clear its intention to deal with Iraq in order to bring about a regime change and eliminate any potential threat of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) which might come from Iraq. The inclusion of Iraq as one of the three original members of President Bush's &quot;Axis of Evil&quot; raised considerable concern around the world. It appeared that the US was poised to take its war on terrorism on to Iraq, once the Taleban has been ousted in Afghanistan. Indeed there was much discussion about the possibility of a war against Iraq beginning this Summer.<br>
				<br>
				The rationale for putting Saddam Hussein high on the US military hit list is the increasing concerns about his development of weapons of mass destruction. This is not a new concern, Saddam used chemical weapons for internal repression as well as in his war with Iraq over a decade ago. After the Gulf War, large chemical weapon stocks were destroyed. He was also investing great efforts in both biological and nuclear weapon development. The scale of the nuclear research  work was astonishing, but again that was dismantled by the UN inspection regime. Although the UN inspectors were hampered in their work, it is generally agreed that they were successful in preventing Iraq from gaining an operational nuclear weapon capability, and they much reduced their other weapon development. <br>
				<br>
				Since the inspectors left four years ago, information has mainly come from defectors and overhead surveillance. The patrolling of the No Fly Zones by US and UK air forces has undoubtedly also kept the Iraqi military focused on their own survival. Sanctions will have hampered technical imports. Nevertheless, these loose constraints will have left some leeway for work to continue on all aspects of the Iraqi weapons' programme. It may be that intelligence assessments are now driving the sense of urgency for doing something about Iraq.<br>
				<br>
				There still remains no evidence of any link between the terror attacks on the US and the unpleasant regime in Baghdad. We can safely assume that if any evidence existed, then it would have been revealed by now. Nor would it seem likely that Saddam Hussein would dispense his most secret, most powerful and most important weapons to free agents such as al-Qaeda.. He will wish to keep absolute control over possession and use of such weapons.<br>
				<br>
				The latest statements from President Bush indicate that war with Iraq remains on the agenda, but that it is still some way off. On 23 May. speaking on his visit to Berlin, the President said Saddam Hussein is a dictator with &quot;a history of incredible human rights violations&quot; who has gassed his own people &#151; and that it would be a &quot;dangerous&quot; scenario if &quot;a country like Iraq would team up with an al Qaeda-type organization, particularly if and when they have the capacity... to deliver weapons of mass destruction via ballistic missile. But he also claimed that there are &quot;no war plans on my desk&quot; for dealing with the threat posed by Iraq and weapons of mass destruction, but that &quot;we've got to use all means at our disposal to deal with Saddam Hussein.&quot; <br>
				<br>
				In a major speech on 1 June at West Point, he explained the new US doctrine:</p>
			<ul>
				<address>
					<li>For much of the last century, America's defense relied on the Cold War doctrines of deterrence and containment. In some cases, those strategies still apply. But new threats also require new thinking.<br>
						<br>
						Deterrence -- the promise of massive retaliation against nations -- means nothing against shadowy terrorist networks with no nation or citizens to defend. Containment is not possible when unbalanced dictators with weapons of mass destruction can deliver those weapons on missiles or secretly provide them to terrorist allies.<br>
						<br>
						We cannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best. We cannot put our faith in the word of tyrants, who solemnly sign non-proliferation treaties, and then systemically break them. If we wait for threats to fully materialize, we will have waited too long. <br>
						Homeland defense and missile defense are part of stronger security, and they're essential priorities for America. Yet the war on terror will not be won on the defensive. We must take the battle to the enemy, disrupt his plans, and confront the worst threats before they emerge. (In the world we have entered, the only path to safety is the path of action. And this nation will act. 
				</address>
			</ul>
			<p>This speech was widely assumed to have now locked the President into a requirement to take major military action against Iraq before the next Presidential election.</p>
			<h3>Operational Options </h3>
			<p>What are the options? We could continue as before. Sometimes the current strategy is to be preferred, if all alternatives are worse. The UN could act to bring pressure to bear through more directed (&quot;smart&quot;) sanctions. It would seek to get the inspectors back in.  Thirdly, a wider air campaign could be used to increase the pressure for getting the inspectors back in. This would be comparable to the Kosovo strategy, where the air campaign was designed to bring Milosevic back to the negotiating table. The fourth option could be an Afghanistan style campaign which sought to use proxy and special forces on the ground with massive air support to change the regime. Finally, a full scale ground and air war might be undertaken to replace the Iraqi power structure. It appears that either of the first two soft options will not satisfy President Bush's doctrine of taking the offensive to the enemy.<br>
				<br>
				How practical are the military options? We have a measure of the scale of military force needed for a campaign against Iraq. In the 1991 Gulf War, a ground force of around 250,000 was assembled to expel the Iraqi invaders from Kuwait. In the event, the prolonged air campaign meant that the ground forces had a relatively easy time, and were able to retake Kuwait in under a week. An attack on Iraq would be a much large war aim, with the need to secure a much greater area. The time taken by the pre-cursor air campaign would give Iraq plenty of opportunity to cause trouble in the region. A ground force at least as large as for the Gulf War would be a wise precaution. However basing for such forces might be more difficult than ten years ago. Saudi Arabia is unlikely to welcome yet more foreign troops.<br>
				<br>
				There is also the question of whether allies will be either willing or able to contribute to such an operation. It has been suggested that the UK might be asked to provide 10% of the ground troops. That would amount to a quarter of the British Army. Already pulled in so many directions, it seems difficult to see how this could be managed without considerable damage to operations in Afghanistan, the Balkans and in Northern Ireland. More reservists are already being called up to fill in the gaps of present commitments.  This could be the final breaking point for British forces, which seem to be needed to be in the lead everywhere.<br>
				<br>
				The military commanders will also want to know what the desired end state is to be. &quot;Regime Change&quot; is a relatively recent strategic aim for military operations. Prime Minister Blair has avowed it on his last US visit when he reminded the world that he has been involved in 3 regime changes in Serbia, Sierra Leone and Afghanistan. It is arguable that the regime changes were by-products of the campaigns, much as was the case for the Argentinian Junta after the Falklands war 20 years ago. Certainly, there is no clear military handbook on how to make such changes happen, short of invading and colonising a country. </p>
			<h3>Alliance Requirements</h3>
			<p>The military planners for a major operation against Iraq will need to know which countries they can count on for direct military support, basing support (and whether that includes the ability to mount operations from in-country bases), logistics assistance and overflying rights. They will also need to take a view on whether Iraq will be able to call on other countries for assistance. Looking at Iraq immediate neighbours (Iran, Turkey, Syria, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait) shows the problems facing any military planner for a second Gulf War. In 1991, Saudi feared that its territory could be at risk from an Iraqi occupied Kuwait, and it gave support of every kind to mount the counter-offensive. Kuwait was occupied, Iran remained neutral although acting as a refuge for fleeing Iraqi pilots, Syria remained effectively neutral. Jordan from its position of great strategic weakness was helpful to Iraq, and Turkey as a NATO member was a very useful base for air operations over Iraq. For a new Gulf War, Saudi Arabia for both internal and external reasons will not wish to be seen as supporting a US offensive. Iran might have been more helpful to the US, but has been given membership of the Axis of Evil. Kuwait can probably help, but will fear becoming a target for Iraq as a result. Syria and Jordan with new leaders since last time remain in a difficult position. Syria is also on the US extended hit list. Jordan will fear both attack by Iraq, and also the difficulties of its western neighbour Israel.  Even Turkey may have concerns about the implications of a new Iraq with a more confident Kurdish population. The Gulf States further south may be able to offer some help, and Qatar is often spoken of as a possible major base to replace Saudi Arabia. The messages from the Qatar government are fairly mixed. In any event these states are more useful for mounting air operations rather than ground forces.<br>
				<br>
				Carrier based operations (like those used in the Afghanistan campaign) would supplement long range air power for any air campaign, but this does not solve the problem of where to assemble a major ground force, and then how to deliver it to battle.</p>
			<h3>New Style Offensive Operations</h3>
			<p>All these problems are likely to narrow planning towards an &quot;enhanced Afghanistan&quot; operation. This would see the use of sustained and wide ranging offensive air operations, with the use of  US Special Forces and local proxy forces on the ground. The planners will realise that this is not an easy option. The mounting of offensive air operations will be constrained by the basing and overflight limitations discussed earlier. There is also a problem of ensuring that there are enough weapons after their extensive use in Kosovo and Afghanistan. Nevertheless, these problems can be overcome within the next 6 months or so. Special Forces is a term used rather loosely. The fewer there are, the more special they are. Thus the British SAS and SBS have a high reputation, but are very few in number. Training can provide better capabilities to elite troops, but this will take time. <br>
				<br>
				The great uncertainty for the planner is the availability and utility of local proxy forces. The Northern Alliance turned out to be a very useful component of the Afghanistan campaign. The Kosovo campaign was less able to co-ordinate use of the local liberation army. In Iraq, the Kurdish northern area is likely to prove a useful area of  local resistance, but for the rest of the country there is little indication of a useful force in waiting. </p>
			<h3>Timing Constraints</h3>
			<p>The problems outlined give clear indications why the timetable for an offensive against Iraq is slipping. Operations continue in Afghanistan, and use the very US troops who would be most likely to be used in any ground campaign in Iraq. Training and restocking of air weapons all point to the US needing at least another 6 months and perhaps longer to prepare. If a major ground offensive is to be considered, an extra 3 months for deployment would need to be added. US mid term elections will be due at the end of this year which may give some domestic urgency to being seen to be doing something. There is also uncertainty about the India-Pakistan conflict and the Israel-Palestine situation, which makes an early operation less likely.<br>
				<br>
				The first Gulf War saw the air campaign begin in January and the ground operation start in March. The timings next time might be around the same time of year, but any ground campaign would last much longer </p>
			<h3>Legitimacy Issues</h3>
			<p>In all discussion of how a full scale operation might be conducted, it is important to remember  that there will be issues of international law to be considered. While the Bush Administration has shown a somewhat cavalier approach to international restraints in some matters, the European allies will certainly wish to be able to justify any contribution to a regime change on the principles of international law. Kosovo was justified without a specific UN resolution, but there was clear evidence of a ethnic cleansing and a humanitarian disaster. NATO acting as an alliance was able to confer a degree of legitimacy. On the current state of evidence, it will be more difficult to make the case for a legitimate military operation to change the Iraqi regime.</p>
			<h3>Three Scenarios</h3>
			<p>The discussion so far has been entirely from the view of what options are open to the US and its allies. However in any conflict, the action of the enemy is the most important element. It is impossible to predict with certainty, and, once fighting starts, the course of a war becomes very uncertain. It is possible to build a large number of scenarios for a war against Iraq by speculating about possible Iraqi responses. The three that follow are chosen, not because they are probable, but because they are among the many that are possible.</p>
			<h4>Scenario One.</h4>
			<p>Turkey, Kuwait, Qatar provide full basing support. Major US strategic air campaign using cruise missiles, carrier borne aircraft, local based air power and long range air power. No US ground force deployments. Iraq rides out attacks and invites world's press in to see collateral damage. Anti-American feeling increases, basing support withdrawn. Arab oil sanctions against US. Increase in terrorism in west.</p>
			<h4>Scenario Two</h4>
			<p>Air campaign as scenario one paralleled by increasing ground force presence in Turkey, Israel and Gulf States. Special force operations increase in Iraq, particularly near sites suspected of involvement of WMD development. Northern Kurds secure region with help of US operations in middle of country. Iraq troops move to border with Jordan and threaten missile attacks on Israel. Outcome very unpredictable.</p>
			<h4>Scenario Three</h4>
			<p>Regime change achieved in Baghdad after attrition warfare campaign, but Saddam Hussein followers continue undercover operations both in Iraq (including against oil fields), but also abroad. The US is sufficiently worried by this scenario to consider the need for a national smallpox vaccination policy.<br>
				<br>
				It is possible to build scenarios where the outcome is much more benign, but the military planner needs to consider the possible bad outcomes in order to take sensible precautions.</p>
			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>From a pure military planning aspect there are too many uncertainties to recommend a campaign to change the regime in Iraq. There are many outcomes which would make the West less secure rather than more secure. Given Saddam Hussein's history of destroying oil facilities during the withdrawal from Kuwait, it can be expected that at minimum , he would repeat this approach if facing defeat in Iraq. However, the political pressure from President Bush to do something about Iraq's WMD programme suggests that the only way to prevent a military operation would be for a total open inspection regime in Iraq, and that even this might not be enough to satisfy US suspicions. </p>
