<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Introduction</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In looking at whether WMD are a growing
threat to the UK, we need to ask a number of questions. The first is
about timescales. Today, the UK is at much lower risk of attack by
nuclear weapons than it was 20 years ago. The Cold War was a period
of very significant risk. NATO's defence strategy depended on an
ability to respond quickly to any attack by the Warsaw Pact, and if
necessary the use of nuclear weapons to prevent defeat. The
mechanisms for escalation to nuclear warfighting were sufficiently
credible for deterrence to work, and we survived the Cold War period.
However, it might not have been so. If deterrence had failed, there
is no certainty that a nuclear exchange could have been prevented.
The scale of the nuclear armoury during that period was extraodinary
(measured in tens of thousands of warheads). We now know that
Biological and Chemical weapons capability continued to be developed
in Russia until quite recently. So at one level, I could answer the
question set in the title of my talk by saying that  in the post Cold
War era Weapons of Mass Destruction are a very diminished concern for
the UK.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">I think however the question posed is more
in the context of the post Cold War trend in an uncertain world,
where threats come from many directions and in different forms. In
that context do we see a future where small states can threaten large
states with WMD weapons; where terrorist groups can hold governments
to ransom, and where  fanatics can promote their creeds with mass
killings? To examine these possibilities, I shall take you through
the possible countries and groups which may be of concern; look at
the types of WMD; consider delivery methods; and then talk about the
political, economic, diplomatic and military counter-measures
available to the international community. But first what do we mean
by WMD?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Definition of WMD</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The grouping together of Nuclear, Biological
and Chemical weapons under the collective name of Weapons of Mass
Destruction is not of itself very helpful. It mixes the ideas of
indiscrimate killing with the horror of the particular ways of death
caused by these weapons. The scale of death caused by the three
different weapon types can be very large. For a given payload, a
nuclear weapon can cause mass immediate casualties (tens of
thousands) and perhaps even more delayed deaths. Biological weapons
may cause similar numbers of delayed deaths, but simple protective
measures can reduce these numbers markedly. Chemical weapons will
produce prompt casualties but only within a relatively small
population. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The mechanism of each weapon is different,
but delivery means may be similar. A nuclear weapon is dependent on
advanced engineering processes. While the design of a simple nuclear
device is undergraduate physics, the manufacturing process is
difficult. In essence to make an atomic bomb, it is necessary to
bring together a sufficient mass of a rare isotope of Uranium (235)
or of Plutonium for a sufficiently long period to generate a runaway
fission reaction. In simple terms an atom of the fissile material
radiates a neutron which strikes another atom and stimulates the
radiation of 3 neutrons, with the release of energy caused by the
change in mass. Those 3 hit 3 more releasing 9 neutrons and so on.
All this happens in very short timescales and the energy released
becomes the atomic explosion. Even greater energy can be caused by
the fusion of atoms. In the Hydrogen bomb, an atomic bomb is used as
the energy source to fuse atoms of hydrogen together and release even
more energy. The difficulty in making such weapons work is in the
design of the mechanics to bring the material together and hold it
there long enough for an explosion. You also need to be able to
obtain enough of the Uranium 235 or Plutonium to have a critical
mass. Naturally occurring Uranium is almost all U238 which, although
radioactive, cannot achieve a self sustaining chain reaction. In
order to extract the fissile U235, enormous centrifuges are used to
progressively separate the two isotopes with such similar molecular
weights. Over a period of time the Uranium becomes more enriched with
U235 and can be used for weapon production. Plutonium does not occur
naturally and has to be produced by a nuclear reactor. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">These somewhat brief insights into the
manufacture of the warhead material are just to remind you that
producing nuclear warhead material from scratch is not an easy task.
You need special handling arrangements, vast electric power supplies,
high technology scientists and plenty of patience. Having produced
the nuclear material in sufficient quantity, you then need to
manufacture a system that will keep it subcritical when not needed,
but bring it together and hold it together for long enough, when you
want your nuclear bang. These days much of this design work can be
done by computer simulation, but this is more  difficult to calibrate
for non nuclear states. This will normally mean that a greater
quantity of fissile material will be needed to achieve a level of
assurance for a self sustaining reaction. All in all the necessary
industrial and scientific capability  required makes it reasonably
easy to gain intelligence about nuclear aspirations for a state.
There is also a considerable time delay bewteen starting work and
fielding a nuclear weapon. The only shortcut is if fissile material
can be obtained from third parties - and I shall return to that
theme.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Biological and chemical weapons are much
more easily produced by any state with a pharmaceutical or
agrichemical research and industrial base. Nerve agents can be
produced by processes that are similar to chenical insecticide
preoduction. The incubation of biological agents is not that
different from the production of vaccine or yoghurt. Sources of
biological agents can be extracted naturally from diseased animals or
humans. There needs to be advanced handling facilities to prevent
escape of such agents, but all of these are available commercially.
Most of the research and production facilities are possible dual
peaceful or military use. The facilities are of a moderate size and
have fewer externally observable signatures. The more advanced
genetically engineered agents are also within the scope of many
nations research laboratories.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The warhead is only one part of the system.
The other key consideration is the method of delivery. Looking for
long range delivery systems, the choices are aircraft, missiles
(cruise or ballistic), shi p( like the USS Cole attack) and human
(the suitcase bomb or the test tube of anthrax). All of these have
advantages and disadvantages depending on the attacking agent, the
target and the technical capability of the aggressor. I will deal
with these as I look at each of the possible attackers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Nuclear Threats</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">There is no doubt that the nuclear aspect of
WMD remains the most worrying prospect for the present. Despite the
difficulties in becoming nuclear capable, a number of States see a
rationale for making the effort. The question is whether, should they
gain such a capability, they will represent a threat to the UK or its
Allies. Let me deal first with those states that have a nuclear
capability today. Aside from ourselves, the other 4 members of the
Security Council (US,Russia, China and France) deploy nuclear
weapons. Indeed these 5 are the only officially recognised nuclear
weapon states in terms of the non-proliferation treaty. Of those, we
can discount France and the US as threats to the UK. Russia is a much
reduced threat since the end of the Cold War, but still has around
10,000 nuclear warheads in service and has a great quantity of
fissile material which needs to be disposed of safely. The
indications are that the Russians would be happy to reduce much
further, if they were given the necessary resources and if the US
also reduced its nuclear stockpile. The START process has a role to
play, but there are other deeper and perhaps unilateral cuts
possible. China is assessed as having only about 20 strategic nuclear
missiles currently. These are seen as giving it a minimum deterrence
posture and it would be very unlikely to initiate a nuclear exchange
from this limited posture. It has many more tactical nuclear systems,
which have implications for Taiwan and its other regional neighbours.
In addition, it has said that the deployment by the US of an area
missile defence system would force it to increase its long range
nuclear armoury. All 5 of the Nuclear Weapon States agreed at the NPT
Review conference this year, that they aim to eliminate their nuclear
capability. They did not agree a timescale.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Next let us look at those States which have
a nuclear capability but are not recognised by the international
community as legitimate NWS. First is Israel, which is generally
thought to field about 200 weapons. The assumption is that these are
weapons of national survival and, whatever their international
status, it is difficult to think of them as a threat to the UK. India
and Pakistan are the only two other states with operational nuclear
weapons. They form a strategic triangle of deterrence with China.
This may be dangerous and potentially unstable, but it is not likely
to be a threat to the UK.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">We then come to the states which are either
working on nuclear capability, or may show an interest in developing
one. This is inevitably  a more subjective assessment. Iran, Iraq and
North Korea are reasonably certain potential proliferators. The CIA
report in August 2000 says:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">Iran sought
nuclear-related equipment, material and technical expertise from a
variety of sources, especially in Russia. Iran is attempting to
finish its Bushehr reactor and establish a complete nuclear fuel
cycle. While Tehran claims that these activities are purely for
civilian energy applications, the report warns that Iran continues to
seek fissile material and technology for weapons development and uses
civilian entities as part of an elaborate system devoted to
furthering these efforts.</FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">While North Korea has made enough
plutonium for one to two nuclear weapons and continues to purchase
items that potentially could be used in nuclear weapons production,
we do not know of any procurement directly linked to the nuclear
weapons program.</FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">We do not have any direct evidence
that Iraq has used the period since Desert Fox to reconstitute its
WMD programs, although given its past behavior, this type of activity
must be regarded as likely.</FONT></ADDRESS></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Syria and Libya have become less so in
recent times. Given particular circumstances, Saudi Arabia, South
Korea, Taiwan and Egypt might become interested.  In terms of missile
delivery systems, the only nations either operating or developing
capabilities for missiles of over 500km range are: the 5 NWS,  India,
Iran, Iraq, Israel, N Korea, Libya, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Syria and
Taiwan. All of these are in reaction to regional rather than global
balances of power, although gaining a nuclear capability would change
their status within the international community. Iran is active in
its development of both cruise and long range ballistic missiles.
Iraq can do little about longer range missiles while UN sanctions
continue. Libya has tried unsuccessfully to obtain longer range
missile technology. North Korea is actively obtaining such technology
from China.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In summary then, the future nuclear threats
from states are unlikely to be as severe as they were in the Cold War
days. The major problem remains Russia, and that needs to be handled
in ways other than militarily.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Nuclear terrorism is even more difficult.
While there are concerns about leakage of fissile material from
Russia, the manufacture and delivery of a nuclear device remains very
difficult, and more easily detectable than other weapons of terror.
However, it should not be forgotten that the dispersal of nuclear
material by conventional explosion can be as effective a terror
weapon, and this is potentially much more easily achieved.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">BW &amp; CW</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">CBW are a spectrum. At the left hand side of
this spectrum you have the traditional chemical agents such as
Cyanide, Phosgene, Mustard and the nerve agents. These are covered by
the Chemical Weapons Convention and work by poisoning the body. At
the right hand end of the spectrum you have the traditional BW agents
such as anthrax and plague, infective (perhaps genetically modified)
bacteria and viruses, which are all covered by the Biological Weapons
convention.  In the middle of this spectrum are the toxins that  are
the non living chemicals produced by living organisms, ans so are
biological agents procucing chemical agents. They are covered by both
the CWC and the BWC, whic is more properly the Biological and Toxin
Weapons convention.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The delivery methods for BW and CW are also
more varied than nuclear. They can of course be weaponsised in
missiles and bombs. But they can be dispersed as aerosols from
drones, civil aircraft, down air conditioning inlets. They can poison
reservoirs. CW needs pretty large quantities to have any mass effect,
but BW can be relatively small quantities given infectivity. </FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In 1979 more than 60 people died of anthrax
in Sverdlovsk over a period of 6 weeks. Five years later, 751 people
suffered food poisoning from eating from restaurant salad bars in a
small town called The Dalles in Oregon. We now know that the deaths
in the Soviet Union were caused by a very small accidental release of
anthrax spores from a biological weapons plant, while the American
salmonella outbreak was caused by deliberate bacterial contamination
of food by a religious cult. Biological weapons are not new, but they
are becoming more attractive to a number of players on the
international security scene. The United States Government is
particularly concerned by the potential threat that it faces from a
wide range of possible adversaries in this area. Most historical
reviews of biological warfare start by citing the use of plague
victims' bodies by the Tatars in 1346 as catapult projectiles against
the hapless inhabitants of Kaffa. The city was conquered when an
outbreak of plague caused the citizens to flee. Whether the infected
bodies were the cause of victory is less certain, given that the
fleas which transmit plague prefer living bodies. It is more likely
that they would have infected the catapult operators than the
townspeople of Kaffa. The example highlights the difficulties of
effective use of biological agents for warfighting. Disease is never
instantaneous in effect, nor is it entirely predictable in its
transmission. In 1763, the British used smallpox infected blankets to
try to reduce the Native Americans in the Ohio River valley. While
there were smallpox epidemics among the tribes people, it is more
likely that they were caused by the normal respiratory droplet
transmission coupled with the Indian's lack of natural
immunity.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">As with many mass killing methods, it was
not until this century that scientific advances coupled with
industrial production techniques made biological warfare a realistic
concept. Germany had an ambitious programme running throughout World
War I and targeted the mules and horses of the Allies with anthrax.
However, chemical warfare was much more favoured because it could
incapacitate troops quickly. After the war, bacteriological warfare
was grouped with chemical in the international efforts to limit the
use of indiscriminate weapons. The 1925 Geneva Protocol prohibited
the use of biological weapons, but did not prohibit research or
possession; it was not until 50 years later that the US ratified the
Protocol. The experience in World War II was mixed. Hitler had
prohibited biological weapons development until 1943, and the Allies
continued their own development programmes for retaliatory use if
necessary. Only the Japanese carried out both a major development
programme and large scale attacks with these novel weapons. Cultures
of various bacterial agents were sprayed from aircraft. In one of the
more hazardous systems, fleas were bred and allowed to feed on plague
infected rats. The fleas were then released from aircraft over
Chinese cities. Each attack required the release of 15 million
infected fleas which must have made the pilots feel that they
deserved equal status with their Kamikaze colleagues. The Japanese
suffered some 10,000 casualties and 1700 deaths in 1941 from their
own biological weapons. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Despite the confirmation that biological
weapons were of dubious military utility, the Cold War accelerated
their development. Large scale production was undertaken by the USSR,
and the Korean War gave an impetus to production in the US. For those
of us engaged in military planning during the Cold War, there never
seemed to be any scenario where the use of biological weapons would
make any tactical sense. In 1969, Britain made a proposal to the
United Nations to prohibit the development, production and
stockpiling of biological weapons. The Warsaw Pact nations supported
the proposal, with the proviso that the provision for inspections of
suspect facilities should be dropped. The 1972 treaty came into force
three years later, by which time the United States had destroyed all
of its biological arsenal. If UN Conventions were universally
observed that should have meant an end to the threat of biological
warfare between States. The signatories to the 1972 Biological
Weapons Convention included the Soviet Union and Iraq. As we now
know, both pursued their programmes actively. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The accident in Sverdlovsk is well
documented . For a short time on 2 April 1979 some air filters at a
biological warfare research facility were accidentally turned off.
Anthrax spores escaped and were blown southwards by the wind. Those
who were infected and died over the following six weeks were all
living or working within a narrow 4 km corridor downwind of the
facility. Livestock were infected up to 50 km from the leak. If a
minor filtration problem can cause this degree of infection, it is
easy to imagine what destruction a deliberate offensive use of
anthrax might cause.  US Department of Defense mathematical modelling
shows that a single drone carrying 6.5 kg of anthrax could produce a
cloud over an entire city which would cause deaths of several
hundreds of thousands of people within 72 hours. While slower, the
total kill rate is higher than that for a single nuclear weapon.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The potential of biological agents as
strategic weapons has not been lost on Saddam Hussein in Iraq. While
the UNSCOM inspection team have been fairly successful in destroying
his nuclear and chemical warfare capacity, they are less certain how
well they have done in reducing his ability to manufacture biological
weapons. It appears that Iraq is still intent on achieving a
strategic capability using weapons of mass destruction, and that it
is more likely to be successful through its biological warfare
research programmes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The August 2000 CIA report says:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">Iraq may have more CW left
over from the Iran-Iraq War than previously anticipated.  Iraq has
rebuilt a number of facilities</FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">destroyed in bombing during the Gulf
War and Desert Fox, and is</FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">attempting to develop unmanned aerial
vehicles that could be used fordelivering CW and BW.</FONT>
</ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">Iran possesses a number of CW,
including blister, blood, and choking agents and the bombs and
artillery shells for delivering them.  Iran continues to seek outside
assistance in all aspects of chemical weapons development,
particularly from Russia and China.</FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">After UN sanctions against it were
dropped in April of last year, Libya wasted no time in attempting to
obtain chemical weapons components and expertise from other
countries, primarily in Western Europe. Libya still wants to
establish its own offensive CW capability and continues to pursue an
indigenous production capability.</FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">North Korea has both the production
capacity and means of delivery for a wide variety of CW and BW</FONT>
</ADDRESS></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"> While the number of potential nuclear
weapon states in the world has declined in recent years, the number
of states which seem to be developing a capability for the strategic
use of biological weapons has been increasing. The biological weapon
is sometimes described as the poor man's atom bomb. Certainly its
manufacture is far simpler than that of a nuclear weapon. The process
can also be hidden more easily, as commercial biomedical factories
can be used to produce the pathogens. Delivery systems are required,
but given the comparatively small payload weight, they can be
concealed more easily. States, like Iraq, see a strategic biological
weapon arsenal as a means of standing up to the nuclear powers. As
was seen in the Gulf War, this can be a two edged sword. It is now
clear that they had weaponised biological agents, but they were
deterred from using them by the implicit threat of nuclear
retaliation by the US or Israel. Our question remains who is likely
to threaten the UK in this way?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The future threat from such weapons is much
more likely to be from non-state actors. Biological weapons are
relatively easy to produce, cause great fear among the general
population, and given the delay caused by the disease incubation
period are anonymous. This makes them attractive to terrorists,
anti-government groups, fanatics and deranged individuals. In these
cases classical deterrence cannot work. Can we determine whether an
outbreak of fatal food poisoning is caused by bad hygiene or
deliberate contamination? An anthrax epidemic would be suspicious,
but a particularly virulent influenza strain would be put down to
natural mutation. There have been a surprising number of such cases.
The easy availability of pathogen cultures is one of the problems.In
one case,  a white supremacist who was able to purchase a culture of
the organism which is associated with plague. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"> The mapping of the human genome coupled
with the wonders of genetic engineering may offer some very
unpleasant opportunities to the biological weapon designer of the
next century. Combining the speed and lethality of the Ebola virus
with the ease of transmission of influenza would be bad enough. If
such agents were then able to target particular gene configurations,
ethnic cleansing and genocide could be pursued by dictators, fanatics
and the insane in all too efficient ways. Less this seem too
fanciful,  40 Aum Shinrikyo cult members went to Zaire to help in the
Ebola virus outbreak of 1992. They failed in their aim to collect
samples of the deadly virus, and had to content themselves with
releasing the nerve agent sarin in the Tokyo subway three years
later.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Counter measures</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Before we can complete the analysis of WMD
threats to the UK, we need also to look at the range of counter
measures, which are available to us and our Allies. These are
broadly: regulation, deterrence,  offensive operations, defensive
measures both passive and active.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The regulation regime can be co-operative
through arms control, and unco-operative through export controls of
critical material. Arms control sometimes gets a bad press, but I
would argue it has been remarkably successful in constraining
proliferation. It has roles in nuclear, chemical and biological. Arms
control is well structured in the nuclear field with the NPT, START,
fissile material cut off, CTBT, nuclear weapon free zones. There are
proposals for dealerting and unilateral reductions of weapons from
nuclear weapon states. There have been deals to control North Korea
programmes.  On the much more difficult side of Chemical weapons, the
1993 CWC entered force 1997 with 2/3 of countries of concern signing.
1972 BWC in force 1975 - lacks effective verification regime. Where
arms control fails to stop proliferators, the next line of defence is
deterrence. In the nuclear field this is well understood, but it is
less clear in the case of biological and chemical attack.  The
ambiguity in the UK's position over the use of nuclear weapons
re-inforces the deterrent effect.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Control of availability of dangerous
cultures is an obvious recommendation. However, there are many
potential killer agents, and also many entirely legitimate uses for
them. The need for good intelligence is highlighted, but this will
never be the complete answer in a democratic society. These
discomforting conclusions mean that limiting the threat may mean
expending most effort on preparation for coping with the outbreak of
infection in order to minimise loss of life. While, precautionary
inoculation against the most likely biological warfare diseases may
be possible for military troops who are at direct risk, it is
unlikely to be an effective or desirable general approach. The key to
defensive measures must be early detection of a release of biological
agents. Biotechnology is offering some prospect of fast reacting
sensors, which can rapidly identify a wide range of agents. The
universal wearing of a relatively inexpensive protective mask is
recommended as a way of reducing civilian casualties from aerosol
agents, such as anthrax, by several orders of magnitude. Quick
response medical teams, who are trained to recognise a biological
warfare event are also needed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The more military active measure encompass
both pre-emptive -Offensive action and the development of missile
defences. These are the subject of a separate talk.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In conclusion, there is no certain increase
of the threat to the UK, but there is a range of state and non-state
actors who could become of concern. Measures to counter the problem
are many,complex and need to be tailored to the different risks. One
hundred percent saftey is not possible, but the outlook is not
hopeless. Careful diplomacy, economic measures, intelligence
gathering and defensive and offensive preparations can do much to
contain the risks.</FONT></P>
