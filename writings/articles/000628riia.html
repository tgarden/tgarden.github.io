2000</FONT></I></CENTER></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Last year was a  great year  for the
European Foreign &amp; Security Policy wonks. Much of the exciting
flurry of activity was primarily  possible because of a significant
change in the position and enthusiasm of the United Kingdom
Government towards greater defence cooperation in Europe. From the St
Malo meeting in December 1998, through an important Anglo-Italian
summit in July 1999, to the second Anglo-French meeting of November
1999, we have seen a strengthening of British resolve to make Europe
more effective in its defence capabilities. The Kosovo operation
proved, if there was ever any doubt, that European nations lack the
offensive airpower capability for NATO's new role, and that they were
no better prepared to mount a potentially hostile ground campaign. In
December, the European Council at Helsinki agreed to establish
defence capabilities to enable them to conduct EU-led operations .The
Joint Declaration looks to EU members cooperating to provide a
rapidly deployable and sustainable force up to Corps level with all
the necessary command,control and intelligence capabilities,
logistics, combat support, service support and appropriate naval and
air combat forces. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">At one level, this is a sensible attempt to
make some progress in harmonising defence effort across the EU so
that it can at least generate a useful force of 60,000 men out of its
2 million troops. It also gives a welcome impetus for the development
of some key capabilities such as intelligence and strategic airlift.
What it does not do is generate a single extra soldier, tank,
aircraft or ship. It gives the free-rider nations in Europe an
opportunity to run their defence forces down further by concentrating
only on their contribution to this new force. Years of experience at
fudging goals in the NATO force planning process give little hope of
achieving the Corps capability easily or in full. However, it does at
least start putting in place some structures to look at developing
real new capabilities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The first six months of this year, during
the Portuguese presidency have been a little quieter on the European
defence issue. The question of how the US views the Helsinki outcome
bubbles to the surface from time to time, but seems to swing between
whether the Americans are annoyed about the Europeans developing
their own military capability, or more annoyed about their likely
failure to deliver a military capability. One important, and not much
trumpeted, security development has happened in this first half of
the year. The agreement to develop a 5000 strong EU international
police force, with a raid deployment capability may in the end prove
to be a more effective security contribution than whatever comes from
Helsinki. There has of course been much  work going on in capitals
around taking forward the agreements on European deployable military
capability. The French Presidency is seen as a critical period in
this process, given that France has been central to the work so far.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The pledging conference in the Autumn is
seen as the next big step towards achieving a real, if modest,
European defence capability. I am afraid that I am pessimistic about
the likely outcome. The European nations have decades of experience
of fudging NATO force goals to meet their ever more limited defence
resources. It is not clear why we should expect them to approach this
exercise differently. There will be a number of different force goals
to be fulfilled. The most publicised one, the ready manpower of
60,000, is relatively simple to identify. The difficulty comes in
providing what have already been identified as capability gaps most
recently in NATO's Defence Capabilities Initiative. To take a few
concrete examples: Europe lacks capability in strategic intelligence
systems, modern real-time tactical reconnaissance, integrated command
and control systems, sea lift, air lift, useful aircraft carriers,
air-to-air refuelling, all weather precision bombing, electronic
warfare and suppression of enemy air defence. No amount of
re-dividing and re-tasking the current forces will provide these
expensive force enablers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">As some of you will know, I have been
working for the past couple of years on how  we might start filling
these capability gaps. They can only be afforded as a shared resource
operated at the EU level. Helsinki has started putting in place the
institutional arrangements which could manage such activities - in
the same way that NATO manages its supranational AWACs force. But
where is the money to come from for such new capabilities? The answer
always seems to be that nations must increase their defence budgets.
You may judge how likely this is to happen. The answer is to find
ways to free up defence money from the 170 billion Euros that the EU
members already spend on defence. This can be done by pooling common
activities and rationalising the infrastructure. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">It is encouraging to see that some nations
are beginning to see the sense in such an approach. The Bundeswehr
Commission in its report had one recommendation:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">10.The multinationalisation
of the operational forces should be advanced by adopting solutions
for integration modelled on the NATO Airborne Early Warning Forces
(AWACS) and by pooling the European air and sealift, reconnaissance
and air defence resources. </FONT></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Dutch and Belgians have also been
setting an example for the rest of Europe with their pooling
arrangements, particularly for naval forces.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">There does not seem to be much being done to
advance this in either of the two big players - France and the UK.
They could take a lead by offering to take part in a pooling
arrangement and putting the money saved into a European Defence
budget which could procure some of these missing capabilities. An
example for the UK might be the new air-to-air refuelling capability
which is due to be procured, possibility under contractorised
arrangements. If it were to cost &#163;2 bn done nationally, why not
offer &#163;1Bn to Solana as the UK contribution towards an EU
contract, with other nations paying their normal European budgetary
pro rata share. The &#163;1bn that was saved could be split between a
contribution to a new capability, such as EU intelligence, and the
other &#163;500 million helping out a strapped UK defence budget.
There are many possible examples - Eurofighter being the biggest and
easiest saver.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">If the French Presidency is to be remembered
for more than moving the deck chairs on the Titanic of European
defence, it will need to address these politically difficult issues -
which are made yet more difficult by France's position in
NATO.</FONT></P>
