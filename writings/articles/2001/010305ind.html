			<h3>Moves towards European Defence</h3>
			<p>Sir Timothy Garden<br>
				Indiana University- 5 March 2001</p>

		<h4>Historical Context</h4>
		<p>For nearly half a century after the Second World War, European Defence was the defence of Western Europe from the threat posed by the Soviet Union. NATO was the method by which that defence was provided, and for the most part nuclear deterrence was the key to peace. From time to time the western Europeans would look at ways to get themselves together as a defensive organisation as well as an economic one. There were continuing worries about what would happen if the US became more isolationist, and there was a feeling that the European community needed to develop its foreign and security policy. France was sometimes seen as having its own agenda given its curious position as a member of NATO but not part of the integrated military structure. The UK, with its close ties to the US, was fearful that thoughtless moves towards some European defence arrangement would cause NATO to fall apart. It was therefore the policy of successive British governments to resist moves towards great European co-operation of defence matters.</p>
		<p>The end of the Cold War caused many to question the continuing need for NATO. However a succession of events changed that perception. Although the Gulf War was not a NATO operation, it involved many NATO members and its success was in a large part due to the application of NATO procedures and systems. It also reminded European nations that the end of the Cold War was not the end of history - and that armed forces were still necessary. The break up of the former republic of Yugoslavia gave a series of tests for European security, which showed the importance of NATO and the impotence of the Europeans on their own. Successively the UNPROFOR operation followed by the NATO operation in Bosnia, the Italian led European operation in Albania, the WEU embargo operation in the Aegean Sea, the UN force in Macedonia, and of course the NATO campaign over Kosovo have provided the Europeans with lessons on the lack of effectiveness of their military capability.</p>
		<h4>Blair Initiative</h4>
		<p>Perhaps surprisingly, in one aspect of EU development, the United Kingdom is now seen by its European partners as the leading innovator and driving force. The work that has taken place over the past two years on European Defence Policy (EDP) is widely known as the Blair Initiative. No one believes that the enthusiastic adoption of EU defence goals at Helsinki in 1999 would have been possible without the key work by the British government over the preceding year. In the immediate aftermath of the 1997 UK General Election, the new Labour government gave every impression that it would continue the transatlantic focus to defence policy that had been pursued so assiduously by all its post-war predecessors. The Strategic Defence Review (SDR) took this as its foreign policy assumption, and had little to say about Europe. The promotion of the Western European Union (WEU) as a safety valve for any schemes for wider European military ambitions was retained as a policy aim. Yet no sooner was the SDR published than a new approach to European defence was formulated in the inner circles of government. The increasing enthusiasm for producing a better EU defence posture can be tracked through a series of summit meetings. In October 1998 at P&ouml;rtschach, Tony Blair indicated that the UK would be prepared to consider military co-operation within the EU. The December 1998 Franco-British summit at 1998 provided the real breakthrough with proposals for improved EU defence capabilities, and the requirement for Europe to have &quot;the capacity for autonomous action&quot;. </p>
		<p>The last year of the Twentieth Century was momentous in western defence terms. NATO celebrated its 50th birthday by revising its strategic rationale, examining its shortcomings, expanding its membership, and fighting its first war. The Washington summit in April 1999 produced a strategic concept which was in line with the analysis that had been undertaken in Europe about likely future roles. The lack of capabilities, particularly among European members, was identified as an area for action. The air campaign in Kosovo demonstrated in graphic terms the enormous imbalance between US and European capabilities. Decisions over the bombing tactics or ground force options reminded European leaders of their dependence on American policy as well as firepower. Kosovo as a lesson in power politics provided another impetus to the work on EDP. The Cologne Council of June 1999 transformed the various bi-lateral initiatives into an EU process. The leaders decided to set up the necessary institutional arrangements for the EU to deal with defence. This included an agreement to transfer WEU assets to the EU by the end of the following year. The new post of High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) was agreed and it was filled by the ex NATO Secretary General, Javier Solana, in the autumn. <br>
		</p>
		<h4>Helsinki Goal</h4>
		<p>The culmination of all this activity was the Helsinki European Council of 11-12 December 1999. After the important philosophical and institutional groundwork had been done at the previous meetings, Helsinki was to produce concrete military capability proposals. The member states set themselves a &quot;headline goal&quot;. They looked to develop an EU capability which would be capable of carrying out up to corps level (about 50-60,000 troops) tasks. These tasks would include the most demanding of peacekeeping, humanitarian and crisis management, but NATO would remain the vehicle for territorial defence requirements. Rightly, the Helsinki goal spells out the supporting requirements for such an independent power projection force. It needs command and control, intelligence, logistics, combat support, and the necessary air and naval elements. It has to be able to be deployed within 60 days and self sustaining for a year. All of this is to be achieved by 2003. However it is a set of forces with these characteristics rather than a single formed unit.</p>
		<p>Once the Helsinki aim was agreed, the work has transferred largely from the political process to the bureaucratic. Defence ministries have to look at how they can tailor their capabilities to fit the new requirement. The focus for this effort was the Capabilities Commitment Conference  at the end of November 2000. There was, and continues, an extraordinary amount of detailed staff work to do. In order to list the capabilities needed, scenarios must be agreed. These include the possibility of having to conduct the separation of warring factions by force, humanitarian assistance and evacuation of civilians, and conflict prevention operations. </p>
		<h4>Capability Shortfall</h4>
		<p>Some 144 different capabilities have been identified as requirements, and these in turn have been grouped into seven main categories: C3I (Command, Control, Communication and Intelligence); ISTAR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance); deployability and mobility; effective engagement; protection and survivability; sustainability and logistics; general support. Land, sea and air capabilities to fill these requirements must be identified for allocation. The data is being assembled in the Helsinki Headline Goal Catalogue.</p>
		<p>To give you an idea of the sorts of contributions being made, the UK announced a large but complex package.The army will provide either an Armoured or Mechanised brigade, each of which could be sustained for at least a year; or an Air Assault brigade which would be deployed for up to six months. Combat Support enabling capabilities such as Artillery, and Short Range Air Defence, and Attack Helicopters could be deployed in addition. The Navy has committed an aircraft carrier, two nuclear powered submarines, four destroyers/frigates, support vessels; and an amphibious task group, including one helicopter landing platform and an amphibious brigade. The aircraft carrier, helicopter landing platform and submarines could not necessarily be sustained continuously for a whole year. In the air, we have offered up to 72 combat aircraft (including Sea Harriers), with associated support aircraft including strategic transport. This number would be available for six months to cover initial theatre entry. For a longer term commitment the total would reduce.</p>
		<p>This staff work is an important part of the process. EU defence officials and military policy makers are having to work together to shape the proposals for this new force and in doing so will learn to co-operate further. However, the time is short and the deficiencies are large. Many countries will wish to allocate overlapping capabilities, whereas none will be able to provide key enablers which are missing. These deficiencies were identified back in April 1999 in the NATO Defence Capabilities Initiative, and nothing has been done to rectify the shortcomings since then. EU nations will have plenty of fighter aircraft to offer, but few reconnaissance drones available. There is no shortage of infantry to double-hat for this force, but there are shortages of secure communication systems for them to talk to one another. There is no possibility that the many expensive shortfalls will be made good by 2003. The EU has no funds to provide the necessary capabilities, and the member states have already committed their declining defence budgets to national needs in the near term.</p>
		<h4>French Presidency</h4>
		<p>The French Presidency in the second half of last year was seen as a time of great opportunity for pushing forward EDP. The French have taken a lead with Britain rightly in keeping the focus on capability issues. However, the institutional arrangements are important, and are not yet solved. The WEU seems reluctant to bow out. The lack of congruence between the EU membership and NATO's European membership also remains a potential difficulty. Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Turkey, Norway and Iceland have to worry about the EU dealing on their behalf with the US within NATO. Austria, Finland, Ireland and Sweden may have parallel concerns about their EU forces being drawn in to NATO activities. Nor does France's absence from the NATO integrated military structure make life any easier. And to cap it all, Denmark a member of both NATO and the EU has declined to be involved in the EU force proposals.</p>
		<p>The French handed over the EU Presidency to Sweden with great self congratulation by EU members about how much has been achieved in progress towards the Helsinki requirement. However, the difficult and expensive shortfalls in military capabilities will still not be provided. There will be some bright spots. Germany has been doing some important work on developing proposals to improve mobility. They are working hard to establish an EU airlift capability, which they hope in the longer term to supplement with sealift. This will involve a number of nations contributing to a joint force. As yet, it is too early to say whether this will be more than just another multinational activity. There is no shortage of European multinational forces. Most are less efficient and more expensive than their single nation equivalents. If Europe is to improve its capability, it must look for ways to operate more efficiently. This means that pooling of forces and eliminating duplication of support must be undertaken. This is not an easy road for national politicians, or indeed for national military officers.</p>
		<h4>Pooling Capabilities</h4>
		<p>NATO operates one capability at the supranational level. The AWACS (Airborne Early Warning and Control System) force is funded through NATO, shared between the nations and manned by many nationalities. It is a good model of how the EU might operate pooled capabilities at much lower costs. Much of the disparity between European and American capabilities is not a question of absolute spending levels (the EU spends about $160 Billion a year on defence), but is about the way it is spent. Each EU member duplicates the others headquarters, training, support and logistics structures. Defence is still nationalised. The German proposals for mobility might produce a greater enthusiasm for shared military resources. However that will not be enough to make European defence viable. The delivery of Eurofighter to five EU nations from 2003 onwards could provide a unique opportunity to field an effective European pooled capability. However, the time is now very short and there is little prospect of such a force being established. This does not mean that Britain should abandon its lead in promoting a more effective European defence capability. </p>
		<p>The UK defence programme includes financial provision for replacing its air-to-air refuelling fleet. It is looking at how this might be done by a private contractor. There are few sovereignty issues with such a capability, particularly as it may be done by contract. Europe is desperately short of this enabling capability. If the contract were let on an EU basis, the unit cost would be reduced, the capability increased and the costs shared. Tony Blair could get his initiative back on the rails by making such a proposal at Nice in December. It would be the start of a European defence budget, which is the key missing link in the current institutional arrangements. Without such leadership, the European defence adventure looks set to end in failure like its many predecessors. Nor can we be sure that the United States will be prepared to fill the gaps as it always has in the past.</p>
		<h4>Relations with the United States</h4>
		<p>This new more focused approach to European Defence requires very careful handling in the NATO forum. The United States worries about two opposite possibilities. It is concerned that EU nations will devote their efforts to strengthening their capabilities and becoming rivals to the US within NATO; and they also worry that they will not strengthen their capabilities and will continue to decline in capability available to NATO. It comes at a time when there are also deep divisions between the US and Europe on NMD, and it may be that there will also be trouble of the next phase of NATO enlargement. </p>
		<p>The jury is out on whether the current moves on European defence will be any more successful than their predecessors. However the worst of all outcomes would be a failure in both EU and NATO.</p>
