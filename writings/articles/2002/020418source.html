			<h3>Not much for Defence in the Budget</h3>
			<p>by Sir Timothy Garden</p>
		</div>

			<p>The MOD and the Chiefs of Staff have been making it clear to anyone who would listen that they expected some relief from the budgetary squeeze. Not only has the 1998 Strategic Defence Review proved to be unaffordable, but new tasks have been arriving ever since the last  Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR). The strains have been showing as the Services try to put a positive message across about their declining front line units, and their inability to achieve personnel targets. Geoff Hoon, the Defence Secretary, has been reasonably hopeful about the needs of the armed forces being recognised in Whitehall. <br>
				<br>
				The Budget statement in the House, and the supporting documentation, can have given little encouragement to the defence community. In his speech, Gordon Brown made a passing reference to defence: </p>
			<address>&quot;Since September 11 we have made provision of &pound;50 million for our domestic security responsibilities and, over the last year. &pound;950 million for defence. We will continue to meet our responsibilities internationally and to our Armed Services&quot;. </address>
			<p>While the figures in this statement may be accurate, they are smoke and mirrors as far as recognising the budgetary difficulties for the armed forces. Most of the increase in defence spending was the final payment of the 1% in real terms over 3 years which had been promised in the previous CSR. For once the defence budget had been  marginally increased over domestic inflation. Meanwhile defence costs had risen far faster, and commitments had also risen. There were no promises from the Chancellor of even matching this meagre rise in the coming CSR.<br>
				<br>
				The supporting report and papers are equally silent on the needs of the Armed Forces as part of the public services.  A box of measures taken after 11 September reads:</p>
			<address>Box 6.1: Combating terrorism. The terrorist attacks of 11 September had repercussions around the world, directing attention toward a new sort of warfare. The Government has provided additional funding for measures to counter the security and economic implications of the September attacks, which include: </address>
			<address>
			</address>
			<ul>
				<address>
					<li>allocating an additional &pound;155 million to the Ministry of Defence for new military equipment and urgent operational requirements;
					<li>funding humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan, and elsewhere, with over &pound;120 million of new support for the region;
					<li>	an additional &pound;20 million of resources to strengthen the UK's tough anti-terrorist financing regime and to fund other anti-terrorism measures. Before the fall of Kabul the UK froze $100 million of assets belonging to the Taleban, Usama Bin Laden and al-Qa'ida. Of these funds, $85 million have been unfrozen and are being returned to the new Afghan authorities
					<li>	ensuring that the aviation industry could continue business by providing airlines with an insurance guarantee;
					<li>	providing a further &pound;30 million of funding to the Metropolitan police and other forces; and
					<li>entering into a unique partnership with the tourism industry in a major promotional campaign in the United States and Western Europe. The Government has allocated &pound;20 million, which will be matched by the industry, to the Million Visitor Campaign.
				</address>
			</ul>
			<p>Very little of this will make a difference to the main budgetary problems. The only relevant part is the increase of &pound;155 million as a one off payment for urgent operational requirements. These will have been needed for the operations in Afghanistan, and will provide a measure of relief in the equipment budget. However, the shortfall in the equipment budget is said to be over &pound;1bn in order to meet the expectations of the 1998 Strategic Defence Review.<br>
				<br>
				In looking at the Public Service Agreement  (PSA) targets for the MOD, the Treasury shows an ability to focus on what can be measured, and perhaps miss what is happening to defence capability as a whole. The reports only other reference to defence says:</p>
			<address>6.26  The main PSA targets for defence focus on implementation of elements of the 1998 Strategic Defence Review (SDR). A number of these SDR targets have been met, including the establishment of the Joint Helicopter Command, the launch of the Procurement Executive as the Defence Procurement Agency, and a reduction in the value of non-munitions stockholdings by &pound;2.2 billion. The public-private partnership (PPP) for the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency was not completed in April this year as planned, but the majority of its business has been vested as Qinetiq plc, and the PPP is now expected during the course of 2002-03. The targets for raising manning levels in the armed forces have been rolled forward to 2004.</address>
			<address>
			</address>
			<p>The final sentence covers the inability to retain people in the Services, and therefore the need to adjust personnel targets.<br>
				<br>
				Geoff Hoon will soon have to deliver his mini Defence Review, the added chapter in the SDR. When he launched it, he talked about the need for &quot;rebalancing&quot; after 11 September. It certainly looks now as though it will turn into an exercise of cuts. The savings process has already started with the closing of a Tornado F3 squadron, the early disbandment of the Sea Harrier force, and the reduction in the Nimrod frontline. We may expect some more rationalisation of undermanned units, and perhaps a relook at Eurofighter numbers. It would be good to think that the commitments side of life would also be reviewed to give some relief, but this is unlikely.<br>
				<br>
				If, as is not impossible, a terrorist attack on the scale of 11 September takes place in Britain, the Chancellor may have some explaining to do. He is enthusiastic about many of the approaches taken in the USA &#150; but not it seems when it comes to military matters.<br>
