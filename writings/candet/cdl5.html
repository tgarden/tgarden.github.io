<H2><CENTER>FRENCH NUCLEAR STRATEGY</CENTER></H2>

<H4>THE FOURTH REPUBLIC</H4>

<P>Although French scientists had been involved in early work on the
development of the atomic bomb, France - like Britain - had no
prospect of sharing in the fruits of American research after the war.
The trauma of occupation made the reestablishment of France as a
major power within a secure Europe the great concern of post-war
governments. While the formation of NATO was welcomed as an aid to
security, there was considerable debate in 1949 as to the credibility
of the Anglo-Saxon guarantees to the European mainland. 1 The French
military were well aware of the importance of atomic weapons, and
much emphasis was placed on the tactics of the nuclear battlefield.
This concern over the effect of atomic weapons on war tactics led to
the emergence of a body of military opinion which considered them an
essential part of the nation's arsenal. From the mid-195Os, this
military view, coupled with the establishment hope that atomic
weapons could give more strength per franc, formed a climate of
opinion for the production of such weapons which could survive the
changing governments.</P>

<P>While the government of the day did examine the question of
producing atomic bombs from time to time, the decision was always
postponed. As in Britain, research continued unhampered by political
decision. The Commissariat d l'Energie Atomique (CEA) had been set up
by General de Gaulle in October 1945 with similar broad terms of
reference to those of Harwell. The CEA was entrusted with the mission
of developing the uses of atomic energy for science, industry and
national defence.2 The initial period of research was followed by an
industrial phase from 1952, which involved the construction of two
plutonium producing reactors. In this way, the weapons production
option was retained. The weapon development phase emerged in the
mid-195Os, without any specific government decision having been
taken. A study of how this happened concludes that:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>Guidance and direction for nuclear
policy came not from the French Government or the French Parliament,
but from a small dedicated group of administrator-techno- crats,
politicians and military officers, whose activities centred on and
emanated from the CEA.3 </I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Through the changing coalition governments, the question of
nuclear weapon development was raised at various times in the French
parliament. A general understanding emerged that France was
researching towards an eventual nuclear weapon capability. The Suez
crisis of 1956 reinforced the mistrust of American protection, and a
new CEA National Defense protocol was signed, which formally
established a five year military programme. The decision to prepare
for the first French atomic test was not taken until April 1958 by
Premier Gaillard. This was no more than a rubber stamp decision by
another of the succession of weak governments.</P>

<H4>THE DE GAULLE ERA</H4>

<P>What coherent policy discussion that there had been during the
Fourth Republic suggested that the role seen for atomic weapons was
as a part of the NATO Alliance, albeit as an independent great power.
The advent of Charles de Gaulle and the Fifth Republic changed this.
After an early attempt to wrest the control of NATO from the United
States by a change to tripartite control, de Gaulle declared his
position at a speech at the Ecole Militaire on 3 November 1959.
Having dismissed the NATO concept of integrated forces, he went on to
say: <I>... what we must achieve during the coming years is a force
capable of acting exclusively on our behalf, a force which has been
conveniently called a force de frappe' susceptible to deployment
anywhere at any time. It goes without saying that the basis for such
a force will be atomic armament- whether we manufacture it or buy it-
- but one which belongs to us.4 </I></P>

<P>There was little discussion of the strategy or force structure
necessary. Kohl suggests that the aims of de Gaulle in producing the
force de frappe were: the restoration of French grandeur, the
reunification of Europe, the subordination of West Germany and hence
French leadership in Europe, and ultimately an independent role for
Europe in the world.5</P>

<P>On 13 February 1960, France successfully tested its first atomic
bomb. Later that year, the government introduced its first five year
plan for the development of national defence. The plan was concerned
with nuclear weapons research and the procurement of both aircraft
and missile delivery systems. In 1963, the first of the supersonic
Mirage IV prototypes was delivered, and 50 were operational by 1966.6
The arrival of the hardware of nuclear warfare might have been
expected to lead to greater debate over nuclear strategy in the
country. De Gaulle's interest in such academic matters appeared to be
limited. He saw the nuclear force primarily as a diplomatic tool. His
strategy is usually described as that of 'proportional deterrence'.
He explained this in 1964:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>Doubtless the megatons that we could
launch would not equal in number those that the Americans and
Russians are able to unleash. But once reaching a certain nuclear
capability, and with regard to one's own direct defence, the
proportion of respective means has no absolute value. Indeed, since a
man and a people can only die once, the deterrent exists provided
that one has the means to wound the possible aggressor mortally, that
one is very determined to do it and that the aggressor is convinced
of it 7</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The French posture was one of immediate and massive retaliation
once French territory was threatened. The concept of flexible
response was rejected on the grounds that Europe would be destroyed
as the host to the battle. The leading strategic thinkers in France
in the 1960s were Generals Gallois and Beaufre. The former strongly
resisted the concept of tactical nuclear weapons and their use for
graduated deterrence, and the latter highlighted the importance of
the second decision centre, which improved the overall credibility of
the NATO deterrent. One official publication 8 reflected this view of
deterrence enhanced through the uncertainty caused by independent
decision centres.</P>

<P>Under de Gaulle, the nuclear strategy was completely interwoven
with foreign policy. Up to 1962, he looked for power within the
Western Alliance, and nuclear independence was the method of
achieving this. From 1962 to 1965, he sought an independent position
to deprive the Americans of control over the destiny of France. This
was reflected in the concern over flexible response and multilateral
force proposals. From 1965 until the invasion of Czechoslovakia in
1968, the French cultivated a very independent foreign policy. A
nuclear strategy of tous azimuths was propounded, in which France
must be prepared for attacks from any direction. General Ailleret
argued that to meet unknown alliances of the future, France would
need to build a completely independent defence system, which would
include a significant number of long range strategic missiles.9</P>

<P>The invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Soviets brought an
improvement to French-NATO relationships and a change in the declared
nuclear strategy. The new Chief of Staff, General Fourquet, dropped
all reference to tous azimuths, and made it clear that the threat was
once more perceived as being from the Soviets. It is likely that
financial constraints also influenced the decision to drop the long
range missile programme. Some reappraisal of the instant massive
retaliation strategy also took place. This was necessary to assign a
role to the newly developed tactical nuclear weapons, and may have
been a case of technology determining doctrine. Fourquet described
the new strategy as one in which the tactical nuclear weapons would
have the task of testing the enemy's intention and demonstrating
France's will. Deterrence must be equally manifested at all
conceivable stages of combat so that our will to resist any
aggression :. appears quite clear, and marks our determination to
have, if necessary, rapid and inevitable recourse to the ultimate
weapon. 10 .</P>

<P>This was acceptance of flexible response, albeit with fewer -
rungs on the escalation ladder and a lower nuclear threshold.It
raised a number of problems in relations with NATO, given that such
tactical weapons would need to be used against an enemy in West
Germany.</P>

<H4>AFTER DE GAULLE</H4>

<P>In France, the credibility of the nuclear deterrent was little'
questioned. The force was never large, was vulnerable on the' ground,
and the survivability of the Mirage IV was suspect after 1969. The
1965 plan had recognised this by planning for ' an intermediate range
ballistic missile force, based on land, and- a submarine-based force.
Financial constraints and difficulties in development resulted in
delays and cutbacks. It was not until 1971 that the first submarine,
Le Redoutable, became operational, with 18 land-based missiles coming
the following year. Yet the charisma of General de Gaulle had made
the force de frappe a credible deterrent up to 1969.</P>

<P>President Pompidou sought a strategy which could combine the
requirement for an effective force with the need for economic
restraint. He did, however, instigate a review for the improvement of
the armed forces in general, and the navy in L particular. The
1971-75 programme recognised the need to improve conventional
strength. President Giscard d'Estaing also initiated a review in
1974, with a view to improving conventional forces. He confirmed his
belief in the doctrine of proportional deterrence and said,
<I>'France is and must remain the third nuclear power in the world
and it goes without saying that we reject any idea of a ceiling on
the French nuclear force'.l1 </I>His 1977-82 plan noted the depletion
of conventional forces, which had suffered at the expense of nuclear
forces since 1960. The trend would be reversed, although the weapons
yield</P>
