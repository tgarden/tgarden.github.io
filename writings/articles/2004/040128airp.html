			<h3><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">Introduction</font></h3>
			<p><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">For previous Air Power conferences, I have been allocated the slot covering the political dimension of air power, so I have had to rethink how I might tackle today's placement in the media section of the conference. I thought I would give you three different approaches. First, I would like to talk a little about the nature of the media coverage, and in particular its implications for wider public understanding of air power. Then I will give you the impressionistic picture of the air campaign which I built up as a commentator from the various sources that were available. Those of you who were directly involved can then judge how valid the picture that this commentator tried to put across was. Finally, I thought it might be useful to list a few questions which I think air power providers need to be asking &#150; and be prepared to answer to their political masters.</font></p>
			<h3><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">Public Information Sources</font></h3>
			<p><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">Television in all its forms benefited from the war coverage. The Independent Television Commission has published a comprehensive study : &quot;Conflict around the clock: Audience reactions to media coverage of the 2003 Iraq war&quot; from which all my data is taken. As you can see the increase in news viewing figures is startling with terrestrial analogue channels up from just under three hours a week to over 5 hours. For cable and satellite rolling news the rise is from just under 2 hours a week to nearly 5 hours. All the other forms of media coverage saw only very limited change in reported public interest through the war.<br>
					<br>
					So TV is king, and that is perhaps the first lesson for air power. A very good article in Washington Post on the air campaign summed the problem up well:</font></p>
			<address><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">Although television cameras captured the dramatic bombardment of downtown Baghdad, Moseley's aggressive prosecution of the broader air war -- a campaign that dropped 29,000 bombs and missiles on thousands of targets in Iraq -- played out largely behind the scenes. There were several reasons for this: Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations playing host to  U.S. air crews refused to accept embedded reporters, who might have conveyed a greater sense of the air strategy to American audiences; many targets were out of sight of journalists on the battlefield; and senior military officials did not discuss their strategy in public.<br>
					<br>
					An Air War of Might, Co-ordination and Risks<br>
					Washington Post 26 April 2003</font></address>
			<h3><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">Personal Information Sources</font></h3>
			<p><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">Let me say a few words about the sources of information open to me and other commentators. Obviously we were employed as pundits by the media because we could draw on past experience and/or academic study in the field. But to comment authoritatively, we needed access to information. In this Iraq campaign it was less easy to obtain the overall picture than in previous conflicts I have commented on over the past 7 years since retirement. I perhaps also need to give you a feel for the intensity of the media requirements. As I trooped round the studios, I would bump into many familiar faces time and time again. My typical day during the war was rise at 0430, at White City for 0540, from 0600 to 0900 on the couch for BBC Breakfast, into Westminster to brief Charles Kennedy's Iraq crisis group at 1000, then to Millbank to do perhaps 6 or 7 pieces for a variety of international and domestic tv and radio stations. Home by 1430 to write an article for the next day's newspaper. In to Gray's Inn Road for Ch4 or Ch5 7pm news, and home for dinner. Remember that media comment is not just for UK audiences. The international TV, Radio and newspapers were also all wanting comments, and operating around the clock.<br>
					<br>
					My main information sources were therefore inevitably the ones coming through the media that I was working with. The sequence of 3 hours in the morning talking to each of the BBCs embedded reporters and the CENTCOM brief started the day. Other sources were picked up through the day. Embedded reporters are a mixed blessing giving a very narrow but vivid picture. If CENTCOM could have placed those reports in the wider strategic picture, we would have had much better informed coverage &#150; and of air power in particular. But the CENTCOM media centre was a disaster. It was scared of providing comment before Washington had taken the glory. Nor was our own MOD any better. It managed to get itself confused about its &quot;talking heads&quot;, given that many of us had not been supporting an early intervention in the run up to the war.</font></p>
			<h3><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">The Air Campaign</font></h3>
			<p><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">So what messages did this commentator try to get across about the air campaign? I saw my role as trying to draw attention to the gaps in the picture which came from relying on the embedded reporters as the main source of coverage. I shall not give you a blow by blow account, as this comes much better from those who were at the sharp end. Perhaps I can indicate some of the areas where we lacked information, which might have given a more complete air power picture. There was some interest in the concept of &quot;Shock and Awe&quot;, but the analysis was often confused by a combination of a lack of understanding of the concept, and also the unexpected and slightly disorganised start to the campaign. <br>
					It is relatively easy to cover the Iraqi air operations, since it appears that none were mounted throughout the operation. It did mean however, given the pre-war softening up of Iraqi air defences, that there was no story of an initial counter-air campaign, which we had had in previous TV wars.<br>
					<br>
					There is a possibility that the unplanned early start to operations caused some difficulty in adjusting the Air Tasking Order rapidly. The normal cycle time of 72 hours is seen as a limitation on flexibility. USCENTAF  reports that a special capability to find, fix, track, engage and assess the most important targets had been developed. These were known as Time Sensitive Targets (TST) and divided between leadership, weapons of mass destruction and terrorism. Out of more than 30,000 designated targets only 156 were TSTs. It is not clear whether the low number reflects lack of intelligence, capability or a genuine lack of need for more.<br>
					<br>
					Offensive air operations were conducted by surface and air launched cruise missiles, air delivered precision guided bombs and free fall ballistic bombs. The current best estimate of total bomb and missile expenditure is 29,199  ,which is about the same number as the Kosovo air campaign, which lasted for 3 times as long.  Yet Iraq is 17 times the combined area of Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo. It appears that daily strike rates averaged around 1000 , which is of the same order of magnitude as in the 1991 Gulf War.  The significant difference for this operation was that the majority (68% ) of weapons used were precision guided, and it is likely that there will be post conflict evidence to show the much greater weapon effectiveness. The impression given during the war was that an even higher proportion were precision.<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					The large scale availability of precision weapons meant that it was also possible to target the regime leadership and communication nodes at the same time. The strategy was to disconnect the regime leadership from its military commanders, and those commanders from their fighting units. Air superiority was achieved from the start. However, the resistance experienced by the initial ground operations in the south meant that air power effort had also to be directed to supporting the ground advance.<br>
					<br>
					The integration of ground and air operations made it possible for offensive strike aircraft to be used at times in more direct support of ground forces. A particular worry was the Iraqi defence line to the south of Baghdad, where three Republican Guard divisions were deployed. At the end of March, US forces were unable to continue their rapid progress northwards. Sandstorms hampered normal close air support missions but Iraqi defensive positions were repeatedly attacked with a range of munitions. One A10 squadron reported   a non-standard high usage of cluster bombs during this period when pinpoint targets were obscured. The UK MOD post War report  identifies the need for a concept for urban operations with Close Air Support.<br>
					<br>
					Once the weather cleared, the Republican Guard defences became the focus of offensive air operations. The capture of Tallil airfield outside Nasiriyah provided a refueling and re-arming facility for close air support operations. Strike aircraft with unused munitions from missions elsewhere were authorised to attack the Republican Guard on their return flights. By 4 April , the Medina Division of the Republican Guard was estimated to be at less than 18% of full strength, and the Hammurabi Division was rated as below 44%.<br>
					<br>
					Throughout the campaign strategic attacks continued against selected targets in Baghdad. The use of penetration bombs to attack a telecommunications tower suggests that the communication nodes were a high priority. The apparent lack of cohesion of the Iraqi defences may in part be attributable to a lack of communications from higher authority. It also appears that risks of civilian casualties limited some targeting. The target selection differed from the earlier Iraq campaign. On this occasion, bridges and major routes were not struck as the coalition forces were making rapid ground progress. Perhaps more surprisingly, the electricity facilities were largely left undamaged. This may have been because of concerns about longer term humanitarian problems, or the need to keep the administrative infrastructure in place to help post conflict reconstruction.<br>
					<br>
					Despite its relatively low public profile, the air power operations appear to have been the key to the rapid degradation of Iraqi defences, and hence the relative ease with which ground troops took over the country. The lack of any Iraqi air operations made little difference as they would have been rapidly destroyed if they had attempted to fly. Over 1800 aircraft were involved, 802 cruise missiles were fired, and enough fuel was transferred in the air to keep a 737 airliner flying for nearly twelve years. It is not clear yet how important a role uninhabited air vehicles played, but it was the first time that 4 Predator drones had been flown simultaneously in support of combat operations. </font></p>
			<h3><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">Intelligence </font></h3>
			<p><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">It is difficult to make even a tentative assessment of coalition intelligence achievements at this stage. In the field of strategic intelligence, the continuing criticism of the failure to find any weapons of mass destruction leaves questions to be answered. The apparent misassessment of the effectiveness of Iraqi paramilitaries in the opening days of the campaign was surprising as the academic community had predicted such Iraqi tactics.  However, the success in targeting command and control nodes suggests that the tactical intelligence was of a high quality. Some 1000 sorties were devoted by 80 specialist aircraft to the intelligence task and produced 42,000 battlefield images and 2400 hours of signal intelligence flying.   Control of space assets was given to the Combined Forces Air Component Commander for the first time. There have also been suggestions that human intelligence resources were helpful in targeting the leadership with precision weapons.<br>
					Weapons of Mass Destruction <br>
					<br>
					The declared cause for the war had been the lack of transparency which the Iraqi regime had shown over weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programmes. It might have been expected that finding these would have been a priority for the coalition war plans. However, there has been little evidence that they were uppermost in the concept of operations. Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon claimed that the most important campaign objective was to deny Iraq use of its weapons of mass destruction. In order to do this &quot;our efforts have centred on disabling the command and control facilities through which the Iraqi regime would order the use of such weapons&quot;.  This was the same strategy as required to win the ground war. While there were a number of false alarms about the discovery of chemical weapons, no finds were made during the period of the campaign. There were also some concerns about the possible use of chemical weapons against coalition troops or Iraqi civilians. Again none of these fears were realised. The apportionment of air targets categorised as designed to suppress Iraqi weapon of mass destruction delivery systems and infrastructure was 10.7% of the total approved targets. <br>
					<br>
					The coalition forces had to be prepared for operations in chemical conditions. While the protective clothing that they had would have provided adequate defence, wearing it in combat increases fatigue particularly in hot temperatures. There is not yet a clear picture on what policy was adopted for the wearing of full protective clothing, with respirators immediately ready for donning. Media reports indicated that readiness varied over both time and location. Subsequently, it has become clear that there were serious shortfalls in NBC equipment for UK forces in theatre.</font></p>
			<h3><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">Psychological Operations</font></h3>
			<p><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">The coalition attached considerable importance to the use of psyops in its requirement to bring a rapid end to hostilities. A total of 158 air missions dropped 31,800,000 leaflets. The US analysis  equates this to 120,454 rolls of toilet paper, which may be an early indication of how effective this technique was seen to be. Sorties providing radio and television broadcasts were also flown, but assessment of their utility will have to wait for further analysis.</font></p>
			<h3><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">Casualties </font></h3>
			<p><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">The question of expected scale of casualties was particularly politically sensitive for this operation. Given both international disagreements over the early use of military force, and domestic concerns in all the coalition states, minimising Iraqi civilian casualties as well as those to coalition forces was a factor. The numbers of deaths and injuries will take time to collate. However the early tallies suggest that the coalition forces took very light casualties from enemy action, but suffered relatively badly from accidents and friendly fire incidents. Of 34 UK deaths in theatre only 10 appear to be due to direct enemy action.  For the US, the figures  by mid April had risen to 123 deaths. It appears  that 95 of these were due to direct enemy action. Civilian Iraqi deaths from military action have been reported as in the range of 5425 to 7041.  No reliable estimate of Iraqi military casualties is available, and there appears to be no concerted effort to collate data.<br>
					<br>
					The level of coalition deaths from all causes at around 160 represents a remarkably low attrition rate for a major land and air campaign. Twenty aircraft were lost, but only 7 of those were to enemy action.   There will be questions to be answered about the number of friendly fire incidents in the air and on the ground, and these will require full investigation. Similar levels of unnecessary casualties from accidents and misidentifications were experienced in the 1991 Gulf War, and it had been expected that remedial action would have been implemented. The Iraqi deaths, both civilian and military, did not become a major political issue given the relatively short duration of the campaign. The precision air strikes were also targeted on points where civilian casualties would be minimised. </font></p>
			<h3><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">Technology </font></h3>
			<p><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">While much was made of the possible introduction by the US forces of new technologies to help win this war, in the event there were few surprises evident. What has changed in the last few years is the availability, cost  and scale of precision attack capability. While the 1991 Gulf War had seen some use of precision attack, dumb bombs were over three quarters of munitions dispensed. Most precision attacks in the past had also required laser designation, either from the air or ground. This made them vulnerable to poor visibility conditions and incorrect release or designation errors. The advent of cheap precision guidance from GPS satellites for all the large stocks of dumb bombs changed the nature of this operation. The Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) added a cost of just $18,000 per bomb.  By comparison, the cost of Tomahawk cruise missiles approaches $1 million per shot. Some 6542 JDAMs were used by US forces compared with 802 TLAM cruise missiles.  The intensity of such attacks meant that stocks of both missiles and bomb kits were in urgent need of replenishment by the end of the war.<br>
					<br>
					Detailed analysis of the improvements in the field of network centric capabilities will have to await better information than is in the official post conflict reports. However, it was the first time that an uninhabited air vehicle, Global Hawk, has been used in the strike co-ordination and reconnaissance role. Much has been made  of developing such capabilities to integrate all aspects of warfare, and reduce the time between tasking and offensive action. The evidence so far suggests that there is still much to be done in this field. Even the most important strategic targets against the Iraqi leadership appear to have  suffered lag times measured in hours rather than minutes, and the allocation of time sensitive targets was very low.</font></p>
			<h3><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">Questions</font></h3>
			<p><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">The following questions are drawn from a wider analysis <br>
					<br>
					Question 1: Has the nature of warfare changed? At the strategic level, planners will wish to use this short war as evidence for changes in the nature of modern warfare. The case for network-centric capabilities may be supported by rapid reaction times that were achieved against key target sets. However, there will need to be evidence to show how the integrated battlefield worked across the range of very different operational problems. In particular, the lead times implicit in the current Air Tasking Order system will need to be reviewed.<br>
					<br>
					Question 2: Does technology replace troops? The strategic approach to this war was characterised by a reliance on lighter more flexible troops on the ground than in the past. The analysis will need to look at the risks implicit in extended lines of communication with thinly spread defences. The ability to keep the enemy disorientated is a great advantage of rapidly moving forces, but  could a more disciplined enemy take advantage of new vulnerabilities? <br>
					<br>
					Question 3: Can air power now eliminate the power of armies to defend? It is likely that the detailed analysis of the air operations will show that they proved effective in cutting the links between the command and control nodes and the defending forces. The analysis will need to examine how much of this was possible because of the unique circumstances in Iraq, and whether this technique will be more generally applicable. Iraq had had constant surveillance for over a decade, and was constrained by sanctions in the modernisation of its capabilities.<br>
					<br>
					Question 4: Do logistics still constrain rates of advance? The logistics lessons are often the most important, but can then be forgotten in preparations for future operations. The new mobile form of warfare made the logistics more complex and there will be much to be learned from the after action reports.<br>
					<br>
					Question 5: Are Special Forces assuming greater importance for future warfare ? Although reports remain sketchy, special operations appear to have had a more important role in this campaign than in the past. Future investment in special forces and elite units will need to be reviewed objectively. The balance between such forces and traditional formed units is difficult to judge. If special forces are to remain 'special', it is likely that their numbers must remain limited. It may be that there can be a transfer of techniques to more traditional ground forces.<br>
					<br>
					Question 6: Is the platform/weapons balance of investment right? All post conflict reports seek to confirm or adjust future equipment procurement decisions. This carries with it the danger of preparing to fight the last war rather than the next one. The effectiveness of all weapons systems used will need to be assessed and measured against their opportunity costs. It may be that older systems, like main battle tanks, find a new lease of life. Certainly, the cost effectiveness of new generation precision air delivered weapons will be a major investment issue. Once a clear assessment of weapon effectiveness has been made, it may point towards the possibility of smaller bombs with precision guidance, which would allow more targets to be attacked on each mission.<br>
					<br>
					Question 7: Did the coalition get its media strategy right? It may be that governments and the military are the least able to make objective judgements about the success or otherwise of media strategy. Nevertheless, this is an increasingly important aspect of modern operations, and lessons need to be learned. <br>
					<br>
					Question 8: How accurate was intelligence? From the pre-war intelligence reports about WMD to the reactions of the Iraqi civilian population in the early stages, there appear to have been some intelligence difficulties. The lessons learned from the campaign will need to look carefully at the strategic and tactical intelligence provided. For the new form of warfare to work, intelligence needs to be timely and accurate. The lessons of this campaign should help to determine future organisation and equipment procurement.<br>
					<br>
					Question 9: How important are allies? Despite the apparently large political coalition of nations supporting the Iraq operation, useful military allies were in short supply. Lessons for the future will need to be learned in terms of how to operate without such support. Lack of overflying rights may have implications for future equipment procurement. <br>
					<br>
					Question 10: What are the combat implications if a nation has to be rebuild afterwards? There is a tendency to examine military lessons as they apply to the combat phase. It is already clear that the post-conflict work is just as important as the fighting. Any lessons from this campaign will need to address both aspects. While smaller troop numbers may be right for manoeuvre warfare, they may be insufficient for securing the peace at the end of hostilities. Targeting policy will be affected by the end state desired for rapid rebuilding of essential services. This war may be the time to extend the military doctrine from fighting  to building the nation, and determining the optimum approach.</font></p>
			<h3><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">Better Air Power Media Relations</font></h3>
			<p><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">If air power is to receive the correct priority for investment, it has to make its case. Times have changed with the 2003 Iraq war. Before there was the early air power phase which reminded everyone of its importance. This time the media got most of its information from reporters embedded with ground forces. If you believe that the air power message is important, then you have to start working at the problem for next time. There are still some things to be done about this last campaign and this conference is one of them. However we need some good detailed informed analysis published, and I trust that is going on. The two MOD self congratulatory documents do not meet the bill. The CENTAF report of 29 April 2003 contained more hard information than both the MOD  papers combined. But we still need the post conflict assessments to be done and published. The US air war survey after the first Gulf War was a model of its kind.<br>
					<br>
					If you wanted some guidelines then I suggest you start with this as a list:<br>
					<br>
					a. Prepare before operation by cultivating a wide spread of journalists.<br>
					<br>
					b. Embed reporters with squadrons on every possible occasion.<br>
					<br>
					c. Give operators a freer hand to comment on the media.<br>
					<br>
					d. Own up to mistakes when they happen. It improves your credibility.<br>
					<br>
					e. Produce quick deep honest post conflict reports. This will ensure that lessons are more widely understood and there will be greater enthusiasm for paying for remedial measures.<br>
					<br>
					f. Carry out a full post op air power survey to ensure that there is an authentic historical record rather than a collection of anecdotes.<br>
