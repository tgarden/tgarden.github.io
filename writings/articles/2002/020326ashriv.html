			<h3>The nature of the problem</h3>
			<p>Providing and sustaining adequate national armed forces appears to be a long term problem for the rich nations of the world. The move away from conscripts and reserves, ready to defend national territory,  towards highly trained professional militaries ready for anything continues everywhere.  Yet manning and equipping these multipurpose forces seems to be ever more difficult. In the United States, substantial extra defence expenditure is called for to rectify widespread deficiencies. In Australia, the government has announced a large year on year uplift in defence spending. In Europe, the transition from the standing armies of the Cold War to more reactive and deployable forces is not yet complete after 10 years of reshaping. In the UK, that decade has seen three major defence reviews, and yet there is no sign that the balance between commitments and resources is any closer to being achieved.<br>
				<br>
					Each national review of defence policy produces a force structure tailored to the perceived commitments and available funds. Within a very short time, the funding proves to be inadequate and a new review is initiated. This normally results in a reduction in force capability rather than an uplift in funds. The underlying reasons for this progressive decline in the armed forces can be understood by looking at UK defence policy over the past quarter of a century.  The limits of defence budgets has a direct effect on capability - and of course on the defence industries. Only by understanding what is causing the problem, can sensible solutions be proposed. For Britain and the rest of Europe, these solutions will require difficult political decisions. However, deferment of those decisions is no longer an option if any form of useful military capability is to be retained.</p>
			<h3>British Defence Resources since 1975</h3>
			<p>20 years ago Britain could mount a rescue operation for the Falkland Islands at a distance of 8000 miles,  and was able to put together an appropriate task force in a single weekend. In 1999, a small territory, less than half the size of Wales, has a little trouble with its equally unimpressive neighbour, Serbia. The former Republic of Yugoslavia has been a source of conflict since the end of the Cold War, so no one was surprised by the need for action. The distances from Western European countries were so short that Italy was able to act as the aircraft carrier for the operation. And yet, when it came to the military operation, virtually all of it had to be conducted by, and, for some of the more potent capabilities, from the United States. <br>
				<br>
					The United Kingdom takes defence seriously, it likes to do it well, and it spends a bit more proportionately than other European allies. Yet in the decade since the end of the Cold War, it has needed 3 major reviews of defence spending, and significant capability adjustments in the in between years. These spending reviews are not  caused by the incompetence of defence planners: they are the inevitable consequence of seeking  at best to maintain defence spending level in real terms. </p>

			<p>A look at  UK defence spending in real terms  over the past 25 years shows four distinct phases. In the mid 1970&#146;s defence spending was fairly steady around &pound;25.5 bn a year at current prices. It then climbed for the first half of the 1980&#146;s, reflecting a NATO wide commitment to growth, to  a plateau of some &pound;33.5bn before going into a decade of decline from 1986 to level out at the current base of around &pound;23.5 bn a year. Over the past quarter of a century, real annual resources have declined by just 8%, and for much of the intervening time were up to 30% higher than the 1975 level. Yet a comparison of any of the indicators of military capability shows a marked drop in available capacity. Between 1975 and 2000, manpower has declined from 346,000 to 212,450          (-39%), regiments and battalions from 114 to 76 (-33%), frigates and destroyers from 50 to 31         (-38%), RAF combat squadrons from 38 to 22 (-42%). Nor can it be argued that the smaller numbers of men and combat units are compensated for by technological improvements. Despite the vast expenditure of the 80&#146;s, the UK could only provide some 4%- 10% of the overall air effort for the Kosovo campaign. </p>
			<h3>Elements of defence spending</h3>
			<h4>Personnel</h4>
			<p>	Defence spending can be broadly divided into three main parts: personnel costs, equipment costs and running costs.  Personnel costs, which currently make up just over a third of the UK budget,  closely follow civilian wage costs. In time of full employment they may need to run ahead of their civilian comparators given the many disadvantages of service life. Even in time of unemployment, there is little evidence that the services can underpay and retain their people. Increasingly the  type of manpower that is needed within the services is becoming more technically able, and thus even more expensive. Wage costs usually rise at or above  inflation. For example an experienced  Sergeant in 1975 was paid &pound;3,800 p.a. If the pay for this rank had increased in line with inflation, he would earn some &pound;19,000 p.a today. In fact the figure is &pound;23,000  some 20% higher.  The military, particularly the army,  is a labour intensive industry and must therefore expect the personnel slice of the budget to rise in real terms year on year. </p>
			<h4>Equipment</h4>
			<p>The cost of military equipment is also large. Currently 44% of UK defence spending is related to equipment. Defence equipment inflation  is more complicated to analyse than the rise in manpower costs. The life expectancy of a particular item is often a matter of choice, and may be determined by budgetary pressures. Some equipments may cost very much more than their predecessors, but fewer of them may be able to do the task. For example each Lancaster bomber in 1945 cost some &pound;45,000 per copy or just under &pound;1 million at today&#146;s prices. The Tornado bomber is its lineal successor, carrying a similar bombload over similar ranges. When the Tornado came into service in  1980, it cost the same as 20 Lancasters in real terms. The Tornado is currently undergoing a midlife update, which will cost another &pound;10m per aircraft.  Replacement aircraft have been plotted on an exponential curves of cost over many years. The B2 bomber comes in at US$ 2Bn a copy and even a  anti-submarine warfare helicopter, the Merlin, is now around &pound;50m a copy and rising. Defence programmers balance their budgets by reducing the fleet size with each new generation of equipment. This causes an uncomfortable rise in the relative support costs of fleets. Planners use a similar technique for weapon stockpiles. Weapon costs show a high cost rise with each new generation. There is a temptation to keep the old stock and bring in the new weapon more slowly. In the case of both weapons and platforms the reducing numbers of units procured further forces the unit price up as research and development costs have to be recovered over smaller buys.<br>
				<br>
					 Surprise is sometimes expressed that military computer and other high technology equipment have not experienced similar falls in price and increases in capability that are seen in the commercial computer industry and in consumer appliances. There are three reasons why this effect will not happen. The production runs are very short, and often spread over a long time. The technologies are very specific to the military usage, and have limited application beyond. The period of time from conception to deployment  is typically 10 to 20 years and it is difficult to take advantage of technical innovation which is at a much faster rate. Most equipment costs  rise at more than 5% above inflation and in certain areas may be much higher than this. </p>
			<h4>Infrastructure</h4>
			<p>	The remaining fifth of defence expenditure includes the costs of maintaining the support for the armed forces. Some running costs will be fairly closely aligned to normal inflation in the economy. Fuel, accommodation, food, transport. maintenance and logistics support activities have no reason to be out of line with inflationary pressures more generally. Indeed there are often opportunities to undertake some of these activities in ways that take them out of some of the extra costs incurred by military operations. Contractorised, civilianised and out-sourced  support should be sustainable with level funding in real terms. In a time of declining forces, it is also possible to realise some of the value of the defence estate. Short term spending regulation is also possible by reducing the activity levels of forces, and this has historically often been used to compensate for rising costs elsewhere in the defence programme.</p>
			<h3>Handling Defence Inflation</h3>
			<p>We have therefore in the UK defence programme an inflationary problem. Personnel costs  rise at a rate slightly above  inflation; equipment costs rise much faster than retail price inflation; and running costs rise in line with inflation. The combined effect is that level  defence spending  in real terms inevitably leads to decreases in force levels year on year. In fact, level funding in real terms has been the exception since 1985, and the resultant decrease in force levels has therefore been severe. The Defence Review in 1991 under Tom King reduced combat front line by around 30% with only limited reduction in defence spending. This reflected how badly overheated the programme was at the time. In 1995, Malcolm Rifkind cut the running costs side of the budget to make the books balance . In 1998, George Robertson cut tanks and aircraft to keep the capability for rapid deployment. In each case, the Defence Secretary argued that there were good strategic reasons for the review, but in fact without such force changes, much more money would have been needed. <br>
				<br>
					No British political party is advocating doing more to Defence spending than keeping it level in real terms. This means that there will continue to be a decline  in capability. Some attempt was made from 1987 to square this circle by imposing year on year &quot;efficiency savings&quot; of 3% on the armed forces to compensate for this pervasive defence inflationary effect. What passing improvements were made have long since been absorbed, and it was never going to provide a long term solution. The proportion of GDP devoted to defence in the UK has declined from 5.3% in 1986 to 2.5% in 2000. </p>
			<h3>Overseas Comparisons</h3>
			<p>While I have used the UK as my case study, the story is the same wherever you look in NATO. The 1986 to 2000 figures for other NATO members follow very similar patterns: Germany 3.2% to 1.5%, France 3.9% to 2.7%, Italy 2.3% to 1.9%, Belgium 3.0% to 1.4%, Spain 2.3% to 1.3% and in the US 6.3% down to 3 %. Manpower changes have been between a drop of 25% in Italy to 60% in Belgium and with parallel drops in fielded forces.<br>
				<br>
				It is interesting to see that Australia has recognised in its new White Paper that such an approach to defence funding is illogical. They have decided to pay the price to sustain their defence budget over the next 10 years at its current 1.9% of GDP. They estimate this will cost an extra $US 15bn over the next 10 years on  a budget which is currently $8 US bn per year.   Even the United States is suffering from aging fleets and manpower problems, which will need a significant rise in defence expenditure to correct.</p>
			<h3>The Future Prospects</h3>
			<p>Looking  forward 20 years, this arithmetic takes us into uncharted territory. If all goes well with the economy, we will have sustained a growth rate of 3% in GDP. If we manage to keep defence spending level in real terms, its share of GDP will have declined to 1.3%. Manpower costs will have risen by anything at least  20% in real terms, unit equipment costs will have more than doubled. The frontline will need to be half the size that it is today. New generation equipment may be more capable, but it will be very scarce. In any event, many of the new tasks require manpower above all else. The police have learned the lesson that numbers on the streets matter, and many of the new military tasks are comparable.</p>
			<h3>The Process for Managing the Defence Programme</h3>
			<h4>An ideal Defence Programme</h4>
			<p>Foreign Policy input. Military advice on capability needed. Science advice on best method of achievement. Civil Service advice on Cost. Woven into defence programme and required money given by Treasury.</p>
			<h4>The Real Programme</h4>
			<p>Money available. The 3 year CSR totals. The equipment, structure and manpower in being. Running Costs. The long term plan for new equipment. Overlapping and competing requirements. Overinsurance. Def Prog inflation as compared to RPI. Changing foreign and security policy requirements.</p>
			<h4>Normal Years</h4>
			<p>Costing the programme. Budget Holders. Recosting the equipment and other new features. Listing additions that are needed to the programme. Searching for options to reduce costs elsewhere to make room. Matching to money available. Known for 3 years - assumed beyond. Packing the late years, slipping to the right. Changes in the next year very difficult. Tend to be activity. Efficiency savings. Final advice agreed by Defence Management Board to defence secretary. Once agreed put budgets back out to budget holders.</p>
			<h4>Reviews</h4>
			<p>When they happen. How they are done: Tom King Options for change, Malcolm Rifkind Defence Costs Study, George Robertson SDR. Now the Hoon &#147;rebalancing&#148;.</p>
			<h4>Output based system</h4>
			<p>More commercial approach as if business. Defining output as objectives and cascade down. Measure output. Try to be abale to make objective assessment of future alternatives. Move to business accounting. Already budget holder from NMS. Next accrual accounts with performance reports.</p>
			<h4>Planning new Capability</h4>
			<p>Replacement of old? Evaluate alternatives. Cost programme. Spread and adjust to fit spending profile. Political dimension. Officials advice for best military effectiveness. Balance of Investment studies. Interservice problems. </p>
			<h4>Performance Reports</h4>
			<p>Assessment of of how targets are achieved. White paper Reports. Policy Papers. Defence Select Committee.</p>
