			<h4><b>ABOUT FACE &#150; THE BRITISH ARMED FORCES &nbsp;WHICH WAY TO TURN?</b></h4>

			<p><i>&lsquo;We must act with all our energy, and do our utmost to help (the French), even though by so-doing, we suffer very heavy losses indeed&rsquo;</i></p>
			<p>&nbsp;Field Marshal Lord Kitchener to General Sir Douglas Haig, 19 August 1915.</p>
			<p align="center"><u>&nbsp;</u>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>Competing Demands</h3>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Not for the first time in our history, a number of commentators are drawing attention to the fact that much of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s defence policy appears to be geared to conforming to the requirements of an ally, whatever the cost.&nbsp; Haig&rsquo;s quotation recalls a time when Britain supported a more powerful ally, recently invaded by a foreign power, during a time of war.&nbsp; Present circumstances find us relating to a much more powerful ally, with whom we have recently invaded a foreign power, during a time of peace.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>In 1915 the losses referred to numbers of men; in 2004 they are far more complex.&nbsp; While they&nbsp; include losses of men, these are not on anything like the Great War scale.&nbsp; But they also include losses to British national prestige, our reputation in the invaded region - in which we have long enjoyed particular interests and ties of friendship - with all the long-term results that may result, including an ability to pursue our national ends.&nbsp; In the minds of many, Britain is now so closely inter-linked with the United States, that it is an equally attractive target for international terrorism, particularly by militant Islam.&nbsp; The cost of choosing that route also includes two further burdens.&nbsp; Firstly, the cost of trying to match our military hardware to that of the most technologically advanced country in the world..&nbsp; Secondly, the challenge of maintaining armed forces capable of the range of tasks, which they might legitimately expect to have to undertake from helping civil society through to fighting major war.</p>
			<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
			<h3>Cold War Certainties</h3>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Throughout the period of the Cold War, the size and shape of our Armed Forces was determined largely by our NATO operational obligations. In the case of the Army, this required the permanent garrisoning of not less than 55,000 troops in Western Germany, deemed to be the number needed to defend our allotted 65 kilometres of Inner German Border.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each time the UK needed to take any troops away, such as for temporary deployment to Northern Ireland, it had to ask NATO&rsquo;s permission to do so, while undertaking to return them, to their primary operational purpose and deployment, within a given period of time.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The Royal Navy and Royal Air Force had similar NATO operational commitments, that helped to determine the number and type, of ships and aircraft,&nbsp; that had to be kept at front-line operational readiness.&nbsp;&nbsp; The RAF had much of its operational tactical capability based in Germany.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The circumstances of the Cold War, including the capabilities of the Warsaw Pact forces, determined that UK armed forces had to be structured &#150; and equipped &#150; to conduct high intensity conflict.&nbsp; This had to pose a credible nuclear threat if need be, as well as being prepared to resist an assault in overwhelming numbers, by an opponent who was equally, if not better equipped.&nbsp;&nbsp; Confronting a super power required super power weaponry of ever increasing sophistication.&nbsp; Hence the relentless march towards successively more expensive updating of our maritime nuclear deterrent and its means of delivery, armour and anti-armour weapons and aircraft.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The Army was faced with two entirely different operational tasks.&nbsp; One was the provision of the 1<sup>st</sup> British Corps, based in West Germany, resourced and equipped to fulfil our high-intensity operational obligations under NATO command.&nbsp; The other, from bases both in the United Kingdom and a gradually diminishing number of other locations around the world, was the fulfilment of a variety of manpower intensive, non-NATO tasks, often requiring a different range of training and equipment.&nbsp; The withdrawal from Empire saw the end of operations in Malaya, Kenya, Aden and Borneo.&nbsp; Reinforcements to the existing garrison have been required on the streets of Northern Ireland since 1969.&nbsp; Our sole contribution to UN operations &#150; to UNFICYP in Cyprus &#150; required traditional infantry skills.&nbsp; After the conflict, the defence of the Falkland Islands was another task for lower-intensity capable forces.&nbsp; Hong Kong had a minimal garrison, as does Gibraltar still.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force were faced with similar problems. Everywhere they needed ships and aircraft capable of matching and taking on the advanced technology deployed by the Warsaw Pact.&nbsp; At sea, countering the Soviet submarine threat was a priority.&nbsp; The technology was expensive, requiring as it did the development of three small aircraft carriers as well as long range maritime patrol aircraft.&nbsp; The defence of the United Kingdom was rightly a prime concern of planners, requiring an increasingly complex air defence system, including fighter aircraft capable of intercepting Soviet long-range bombers far away from our shores. But they also had to be prepared to deploy the Army to wherever national interests demanded, and, once deployed, support it until operations ceased.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although much equipment could respond to both types of demand, that was by no means true of all.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>From time to time, the tension between what was recognised as two different strategies surfaced in the battle for diminishing resources.&nbsp; In 1981, John Nott presided over a defence review that concentrated on the defence of Western Europe, recommending reductions in the Royal Navy that it saw as reducing its ability to operate world-wide.&nbsp; He put NATO obligations in Europe first in the UK order of priorities. The invasion of the Falkland Islands, provided the Royal Navy with the riposte that it needed to preserve a global capability.&nbsp; Over the next ten years, UK defence planners continued to try to maintain a broad spread of capabilities. For some of this time, they were helped by a 3% per annum real growth in the defence budget.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>Successive Defence Reviews</h3>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>This argument between NATO needs and wider capabilities had not been resolved when the Soviet Union crumbled. The end of the Cold War signalled an almost immediate downsizing of all three Services, under the 1991 defence review, known as Options for Change..&nbsp; Operational capabilities were understandably reduced, in line with front-line reductions in NATO, the most severe personnel cuts falling on the Army, which was reduced in strength by one third from 156,000 to 104,000.&nbsp; The cuts appeared to be dictated as much by the availability of financial resources as the requirement to combat an assessed threat. Unlike the precision of NATO demands, there could be no such certainty in the post Cold-War world.&nbsp; The need to be capable of coping with unknown future threats to international peace and stability is not an argument that is likely to unlock Treasury minds or purses.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>In vain did some in positions of authority argue that this was too great a reduction before the needs of the post Cold War world had been determined.&nbsp; The British armed forces had always had to be prepared for the unexpected.&nbsp; Warsaw Pact equipment was in the hands of many potential opponents, so future high-intensity warfare could not be entirely discounted.&nbsp; Moreover, peacekeeping interventions were rarely short-lived. Satisfactory conduct of such operations required an ability to sustain committed forces over a period of time, and wherever the international community needed to manage crises.&nbsp; This called for sufficient numbers of trained manpower in the overall defence capability.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Since the end of World War 2, a British soldier has been killed in action in every year except 1968.&nbsp;&nbsp; That sobering record seems unlikely to be altered as the number of demands for contributions to peacekeeping operations, have grown greatly since 1990.&nbsp; Because - with the exception of UNFICYP - the UK had not taken part in any such operations during the Cold War period, we had little experience of what they required in terms of men and equipment.&nbsp; Cambodia required Marines on the River Mekong and Royal Engineers to begin demining operations.&nbsp; Former Yugoslavia required reconnaissance, armoured infantry and helicopter transport as well as considerable logistic support.&nbsp; Rwanda required communications, medical support, road and vehicle repair and water supply.&nbsp; All these contributions had to be found from within existing resources.&nbsp; For a decade RAF aircraft were patrolling both the North and South of Iraq.&nbsp; 20 years after the end of the Falklands War, the islands are still defended by all 3 services. All this had to be undertaken against a background of declining resources and smaller forces.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The first Iraq War of 1990-91 showed up alarming deficiencies in the Army&rsquo;s ability to support itself in the field when deployed on high-intensity operations away from its bases in Germany.&nbsp; Every &lsquo;teeth arm&rsquo; (armour, infantry, aviation or engineer) unit had to be reinforced from others of a similar type, leaving those left behind unfit for operations.&nbsp; Every tank in Germany had to be cannibalised to provide those in Iraq with sufficient spare engines.&nbsp; Artillery ammunition had to be bought back from Belgium.&nbsp; The medical situation was so dire that additional support had to be obtained from countries such as Canada and Romania.&nbsp; Transport and repair units could only be formed by bringing in personnel from a number of existing units elsewhere in the order of battle.&nbsp; Extensive mobilisation of the Territorial Army and other reserves was an essential.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>And yet, despite all the evidence - and the then Prime Minister&rsquo;s undertaking that Options for Change would not be considered until the lessons of the war had been properly studied &#150; Tom (now Lord) King, then Secretary of State for Defence, announced the reductions barely four months later.&nbsp; The lessons had not all been properly listed, let alone considered.&nbsp; In vain did those in authority plead for more time and a re-examination of pre-war assertions in the light of experience.&nbsp; The Armed Forces in general and the Army in particular have been playing &lsquo;catch-up&rsquo; ever since.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Malcolm Rifkind, the next Defence Secretary, instigated a further review some three years later.&nbsp; Looking for ways to make the books balance, he sought relief by contracting out many support area tasks to the private sector.&nbsp; This resulted in yet further reductions in numbers of servicemen and women.&nbsp; As more and more specialist tasks were moved to the civilian sector, so the availability of uniformed, trained specialists fell.&nbsp; For some specialisations this trend could prove to be catastrophic in the long-term.&nbsp; For example the review resulted in the ability of the military medical services to support military operational deployments being virtually eliminated.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>With the arrival of the Labour government in 1997, the new Defence Secretary, George (now Lord) Robertson carried out a major Strategic Defence Review.&nbsp; Although it was said to be from first principles, and not about saving money, the total budget was little changed as a result. It did however put the defence programme on a more rational basis. It looked at the UK armed forces as a force for good in the world.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3><b>Tasks for the 21<sup>st</sup> Century</b></h3>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The collapse of communism has resulted in a world in which, at present, only the USA can be called a super-power in military terms.&nbsp; Other countries can still threaten international peace and security.&nbsp; However, in most cases, such threats will also affect our partners and allies in the EU, in NATO or the UN.&nbsp; Therefore, in logic, whatever capability - high-intensity or otherwise - that we create should be capable of co-operating with our allies.&nbsp; British military forces should be designed to make a useful contribution to a united effort, rather than assuming that the UK should be able to conduct major military warfighting on its own. Indeed much more should be done to co-operate more closely with our EU partners. Progress has been discouragingly slow.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>In <i>Agenda for Peace,</i> Boutros Boutros-Ghali, then Secretary General of the United Nations, talked about three general phases of peacekeeping operations - Prevention, Enforcement and Post Conflict Reconstruction.&nbsp; The recent conflict in Iraq had these same three phases, which can apply to military operations anywhere.&nbsp; Each has different characteristics and requires different force structures.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>A good example of conflict prevention was the UN deployment to Macedonia, which prevented escalation of the conflict then raging in Bosnia.&nbsp; The British contribution to enforcement in Iraq was limited to the south of the country.&nbsp; Since the official end of the warfighting&nbsp; phase, UK forces have set a very high standard of post-conflict operations.&nbsp; They have been invited to send a mission to US ground troops, to advise them how to conduct themselves in such a scenario.&nbsp;&nbsp; British Forces have been able to draw on many important lessons learned on the streets of Northern Ireland and other operational deployments over the years.&nbsp; As a result of their own professional experience, UK commanders at all levels have a better understanding of such work than many around&nbsp; the world.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Nevertheless, the 2003 Defence White Paper indicates that future defence priorities will be shaped&nbsp; primarily by the need to work with the US at the high-intensity end of the operational spectrum.&nbsp; This will mean a considerable investment in the necessary technology&nbsp; to produce what is known as &lsquo;network enabled capability&rsquo;. The extraordinary investment of the US military in research and development means that this path will be difficult and expensive for the United Kingdom to follow.&nbsp; Going down this route means that other capabilities in the conflict prevention, nation-building, counter-terrorism and humanitarian fields are likely to take second place.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The UK&rsquo;s limited high-intensity capability can be no more than a small reinforcement to the massive resources of the USA.&nbsp;&nbsp; However skilled, however professional in all that it does, Britain cannot match US offensive power in either numbers or capability. We believe that the UK should be prepared to pay the price to operate across the military spectrum. However, successive governments have made it clear that they are not prepared to pay the price that this entails. . The political choice is therefore&nbsp; increasingly between high cost, high technology warfighting, as part of US capability, or sustainable investment in our unique capability to do good in the world.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Against this background, the Armed Forces have been increasingly stretched since the end of the Cold War.&nbsp; On the one hand they have been required to undertake a whole series of additional operational tasks while, on the other, they have been threatened constantly with reductions to their budget and what it will buy.&nbsp; Long-standing commitments have included the deployment of varying numbers of units in Northern Ireland, Cyprus and the Falkland Islands and the contribution to UNFICYP.&nbsp; Newer tasks since 1991 have been the commitments to various countries in former Yugoslavia - first Croatia, then Bosnia and Croatia and now Kosovo and Bosnia.&nbsp; Iraq has been in the picture throughout.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>On top of these have come operations in Sierra Leone, East Timor, Afghanistan and the Congo.&nbsp; When the foot-and-mouth epidemic descended into chaos, the Army was brought in.&nbsp; When floods &#150; an increasing hazard in the UK &#150; threatened life, the country looked to the military for help.&nbsp; The fireman&rsquo;s strike required 19,000 servicemen to be stood by and then deployed for tasks in aid of the civil power.&nbsp; Finally, of course, there has been the deployment to Iraq of our sole Armoured Divisional Headquarters, more than half of our armoured forces and substantial contingents from all three Services.&nbsp; Like so many recent commitments, deployment to Iraq looks, at present, like a &lsquo;mission without end&rsquo;.&nbsp; If such commitments are to be sustained, UK forces must have sufficient numbers - of properly equipped people - to enable them to replace those currently deployed, over and over again, while remaining capable of undertaking further demands in an uncertain world.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The 2003 Defence White Paper recognises the problem of legacy systems. Major financial commitments are made to capital equipment projects which may take more than a decade to come to fruition. Because of their technical complexity, there is bound to be a long lead-time before such systems are introduced into service.&nbsp; Their development will have begun in response to the strategic context prevailing at the time.&nbsp; The operational requirement may well now be less important or even irrelevant. Large cost rises, because of changes to specifications, technical challenges or management incompetence have been the norm.&nbsp; As costs of capital projects rise, difficult choices about priorities across the defence programme are forced on ministers.&nbsp; Effective armed forces need equipment suited to their current tasks, not systems for a different era.&nbsp; Yet, cancelling inappropriate and over-priced projects can prove to be both practically &#150; and politically &#150; very difficult.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>By what process do we decide where to focus our meagre resources?&nbsp; The answer is that the MoD, in balancing its books each year, determines what military capability is currently available, and what new projects will be developed for the future.&nbsp; The pressures that determine the thousands of elements that make up defence capability, are as much political, industrial and accounting as those inherent in any rational, long-term, planning process.&nbsp; Personnel costs rise in line with the economy.&nbsp; Equipment costs rise yet faster.&nbsp; Planners have therefore to decide where to shave a frigate here, a battalion there or a squadron up above, in order to make their sums add up.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>The Incoherent Defence Programme</h3>
			<p><u>&nbsp;</u></p>
			<p>Last year, the Foreign Office, unusually, issued its own White Paper.&nbsp; This was published immediately before the 2003 Defence White Paper.&nbsp; In the classrooms of defence colleges around the world, students could be forgiven for expecting the defence policy to be derived from the foreign policy paper. Military power is the servant of foreign policy.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>In an ideal world, we might establish our foreign policy objectives first, and then decide how best to achieve them.&nbsp; Implementation of aspects of foreign policy may, after all, demand particular military capabilities.&nbsp; Military forces will also be needed to support counter terrorism and provide aid to the civil power in national emergencies.&nbsp; A defence policy should weave these multi-stranded requirements into a cost-effective structure, which ensured that all the tasks could and be undertaken in a cost-effective way.&nbsp; The Treasury would then pay the bill.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>In the real world, however, there are many competing pressures on the public purse.&nbsp; Elected politicians must decide&nbsp; how much of the national cake they are prepared to spend on defence.&nbsp; For much of the Cold War this amounted to around 5% of GDP.&nbsp; Today the proportion is 2.3% and declining.&nbsp; This defence budget bears little relationship to either foreign or defence policy needs.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The process of developing the mix of military capabilities remains one of assessing priorities and making hard choices.&nbsp; As a nation, we appear to have decided that we do not wish to fund our armed forces to enable them to carry out all their possible tasks, from high-intensity conflict through nation-building, conflict prevention and counter-terrorism, down to replacing striking fire-fighters.&nbsp; Yet, paradoxically, the government demands that they are prepared to carry all these roles out at any time and in any place.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Security is the first responsibility of any government. If the funding for defence is set at a level which makes it impossible to cover all risks, then a difficult political judgement is required over how best to allocate limited funds. Merely slicing capabilities ever thinner is no longer an option. The UK is now at a stage where some major procurement projects need to be re-examined if today&rsquo;s essential capabilities are to be sustained.The defence budget is in crisis partly because a string of flagship projects&nbsp; - including the Nimrod maritime reconnaissance aircraft, the Eurofighter, the Astute submarine and the Brimstone anti-armour missile &#150; are overshooting their costs by around &pound;3bn.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Some 232 Eurofighter have been ordered against a Cold War requirement. The first batch to be delivered will be in the air defence fighter mode.&nbsp; For current security needs, everyone is agreed that the air to ground version is more important.&nbsp; But that is still in development and delivery is likely to overlap with the Joint Strike Fighter, expected around 2012.&nbsp; The very expensive forward aircraft programme is no longer rational.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The other major capital development is the plan to procure two large aircraft carriers, for delivery in 2012 and 2015.&nbsp; The costs of this project are already expected to rise very significantly; not least as a complex three-way management arrangement causes transfer of blame between the MoD, Thales and BAeS.&nbsp; Capacity and capability are already being traded in an attempt to keep the project affordable.&nbsp; Yet no one appears to be ready to ask the fundamental question of whether such a capability is the most important one for Britain.&nbsp; These carriers will not be able to operate in a hostile environment unless they are part of a US force.&nbsp; The Americans are not short of aircraft carriers. Perhaps it would be wiser (and considerably cheaper) to build another HMS Ocean, that could transport helicopter-borne troops to trouble spots around the world.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;<u></u></p>
			<h3><b>Debilitating Overstretch</b></h3>
			<p><u>&nbsp;</u></p>
			<p>When the armed forces are asked by the government to take on a new task, their automatic instinct is to do so at once, and to the best of their ability.&nbsp; This legendary &lsquo;Can Do&rsquo; approach is their nature and the nature of those who serve in them.&nbsp; Loyal servicemen and women are never happier than when busy; and military operations are nothing if not stimulating.&nbsp; This attitude can impress and take in politicians who have no experience of military life. They are happy to assume all is well with the armed forces as they bring home success after success.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>However governments have a reciprocal responsibility.&nbsp; They must understand the implications of any demands that they make on the Services, in respect of strain on both personnel and equipment. Frequent operational deployment, away from home, is bound to affect the long term commitment of military personnel with family responsibilities.&nbsp; Nor is perpetual deployment a satisfactory basis on which to plan the structure of our military.&nbsp; If governments wish a task to be undertaken, it is up to them to ensure that there are sufficient numbers of trained personnel to undertake it, provided with sufficient equipment of the right kind, and the necessary replacements available to relieve them after a reasonable time on operations. The almost perpetual mobilisation of volunteer reservists, justified during the Iraq war but less so during its reconstruction, is being increasingly questioned by employers. This too is a priceless asset that must not be destroyed by overuse.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>For years the Army has tried to ensure that major units are allowed a 24-month gap between operational tours.&nbsp; This was to allow training in primary operational roles to be undertaken, at all levels from individual to formation, and for troops to have some time living a normal life with their families. Both the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force have similar approaches to ensuring that their people are not always away from home, working long hours in dangerous places.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Overstretched though the situation was before 1990, since then such a degree of stability has grown ever more difficult to achieve because of the decreasing number of people and the increasing number of operational commitments.&nbsp; Indeed tour intervals for infantry battalions &#150; the maids of all work of the Army&rsquo;s order of battle &#150; rarely reach 18 months and, in some cases, are now down to around 10, where they have been for some time.&nbsp; In addition, there has been no such thing as a 24-month gap for Special Forces, specialist troops such as bomb disposal teams or many individuals.&nbsp; If this degree of unremitting pressure is maintained, it is bound to have an effect on retention.&nbsp; That, in turn, is bound to have a longer-term effect on the levels of experience, and therefore operational capability.&nbsp; That is a problem to which no responsible government should close its eyes.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>The way forward</h3>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>British forces undertake conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction tasks with greater success than most other militaries. The UK wants rightly to be a force for good in the world. Britain works with the grain of the EU when it takes on these burdens. Whatever changes are to made to defence priorities, it must be sensible to safeguard this area of unique national expertise.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Equipping the British military for these global security roles will cost money.&nbsp; For example, the Army is procuring a family of armoured vehicles that can be transported quickly around the world, rather than the heavy equipment required in Cold War days.&nbsp; The recent furore over the provision of body armour in Iraq has highlighted the need to ensure that individuals are properly equipped.&nbsp; The present practice of leaving military shelves empty until equipment is needed, when, allegedly, it can be ordered from industry, has been shown up to be questionable.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Prevention of conflict often means early and quick deployment of capable forces.&nbsp; This makes air and sea transport a procurement priority.&nbsp; Reconnaissance and intelligence are as important in peace operations as in warfighting.&nbsp; Post-conflict reconstruction requires forces capable of undertaking a variety of tasks, including the protection of private sector and other agencies, involved in clearing up battlefields, over a period of time.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Governments are always faced with the difficult task of balancing national self-interest against capabilities and resources.&nbsp; There is no doubt that, in our armed forces, the United Kingdom possesses a globally recognised world-class asset. Until 1990 to the UK forces contributed greatly to NATO&rsquo;s deterrence of the Soviet Union.&nbsp; This required an ability to conduct the full range of operations in a nuclear environment.&nbsp; Current threats to world peace are of a different order.&nbsp; Terrorism, including the increasing use of suicide bombers, is not simple to combat.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Today the US is the only superpower, and the UK will normally be acting as the good ally.&nbsp; While it must make sense to retain the ability to contribute to high-intensity operations, as part of a &lsquo;coalition of the willing&rsquo;, that should not be at the expense of our ability to contribute to other lower intensity operations which, on present trends, will occur more often and last longer.&nbsp; To contribute effectively, British forces must be structured, trained and equipped appropriately. Because resources are constrained by the government, choices are needed as where to be effective It is no longer an option&nbsp; to spread the limited jam across the operational spectrum.&nbsp; The 2003 defence White Paper does not suggest that these wider implications have been sufficiently thought through.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The authors of this paper are of the view that the British Armed Forces remain able to make a unique contribution to international security.&nbsp; With the right resources, they are able to contribute in every aspect of the military art.&nbsp; We argue that all political parties should look again at the need for more resources for defence. However, if the full spread of capabilities continue to be deemed unaffordable, we believe a key choice must be made.&nbsp; If it is UK policy that serious warfighting can only be conducted under US leadership and with US capabilities, we should accept a reduction in our investment in this area.&nbsp; This would allow us to build up a well-equipped, readily deployable force, designed to stabilise troubled areas around the world.&nbsp; In this we have unique, world-class expertise.&nbsp; The tragedy is that it is in danger of being lost through underinvestment.</p>
