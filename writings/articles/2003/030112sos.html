			<p><font size="-1">Until George Bush's  axis of evil speech, most of the world assumed that the Korean problem was all but solved. If East and West Germany could reunite after more than 40 years of  the Cold War, presumably it would only be a matter of time before North and South Korea followed. The world was changing: Communism was dead and liberal democracies were the only future.  Yet nuclear experts continued to worry about North Korea. This secretive, isolated, Stalinist state was working hard to become a nuclear power. Economic sanctions just meant that it sold more of its weapon technology to other dubious states to raise cash for its military aspirations.<br>
					<br>
					In 1993, North Korea confirmed worst fears by announcing that it was withdrawing from the international treaty designed to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. The Clinton Administration pulled out the diplomatic stops. By the following year, there was a package of economic and energy measures in place to keep North Korea in the Non-Proliferation Treaty. America would provide a safer form of atomic energy to prevent the production of a growing stockpile of nuclear weapon material. North Korea for its part would  stop developing  uranium enrichment and plutonium production processes, which could allow it to produce a nuclear bomb.<br>
					<br>
					We now know that North Korea was cheating on its 1994 undertakings. Nevertheless, its treaty obligations slowed the work considerably. Nobody is quite sure whether it has a nuclear device or three today. Without the Clinton arrangements there would have been many more.<br>
					<br>
					The agreement with the Clinton Administration had other benefits. It allowed for discussion and diplomatic action. Relations with South Korea improved, and the prospect of a peaceful settlement and perhaps reunification in due course became more likely. Unfortunately, the arrival of the new Bush Administration signalled a big change. In meetings with a South Korean delegation in early March 2001, Colin Powell, the new Secretary of State said: &#147;We do plan to engage with North Korea to pick up where President Clinton and his administration left off&#148;. The next day, President Bush made it clear that he had other ideas. In his first meeting with President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea, Bush said that he had serious doubts about recent US policy towards North Korea. While he was reviewing policy, he was not prepared to resume negotiations with North Korea, which he saw as a threat. The North Koreans reacted by saying that the new US position meant that they would now reconsider their moratorium on long range missile tests. Poor Colin Powell was forced to tell reporters that his earlier remarks on policy were no longer effective. <br>
					<br>
					After 7 years  of being taken seriously by the USA, they found themselves ignored. But more humiliating still was when they became  a member of the infamous triumvirate - Iraq, Iran and North Korea - that was George Bush's axis of evil. Among some Americans, the axis of evil has effortlessly become part of the response to the al-Qaeda attacks of 11 September 2001. Certainly, the fear after those attacks has made it easier for the US Administration to adopt a more hard line approach to potential proliferator states. <br>
					<br>
					In September 2002, the USA published its new strategy document. In looking at the future security challenges, it expressed doubts about how well deterrence and containment could work, particularly as unstable regimes acquired weapons of mass destruction. The policy argued for the use of pre-emptive military action when there was a future risk from hostile powers. This was doubtless read in North Korea with some foreboding. The drums of war for Iraq were already sounding loud. Were they number two or number three on the US hit list?<br>
					<br>
					We now have Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader, bragging that they have been clandestinely producing nuclear material, throwing out the international safeguard monitoring of their civilian nuclear programme, and finally announcing withdrawal from the non-proliferation treaty. What does all this mean for global security, and how can it best be sorted out?<br>
					<br>
					The current situation is dangerous. Without the safeguards in place, we can expect North Korea to start producing enough nuclear weapon material for between five and 30 warheads each year. It already has an advanced ballistic missile production capability. It can threaten South Korea, and the US forces there, very easily: the distances are short and the population centres are large. It had also shown in 1998 that it could reach Japan with a missile. In a fairly short time, it can have an intercontinental capability. The regime is unpredictable. The economy is bankrupt. Their strategy is lacking in subtlety. The threat is certainly much more acute than Iraq now, or even Iraq over the next decade.<br>
					<br>
					Donald Rumsfeld, the US Defence Secretary, has in usual blunt style explained that America can take on two near simultaneous wars. Yet the US is already involved in two major military actions. The threat from al-Qaeda remains real, and the plans for Iraq pose many challenges. On top of that, there is unfinished business in Afghanistan. In any case, war or pre-emptive action in North Korea would be highly dangerous for the South. Diplomacy is the preferred way forward.  The North seems to want the status that it felt it had before. It certainly needs economic support. <br>
					<br>
					The real dilemma will be how George Bush can spin a return to the Clinton approach without appearing to climb down. He has already allowed informal talks between North Korean diplomats and Bill Richardson, who was Energy Secretary under Clinton. He may hope for help from China, but pressure from them is unlikely to  make much difference. He will worry that a diplomatic settlement will appear to be the US giving way to nuclear blackmail. It may be that he decides to try to ignore the problem as he has done with Israel. If this happens, Kim Jong Il is likely to become more extreme in his actions. He can test fire missiles in the direction of Japan. He can sell missiles and even nuclear material to other dubious states. Perhaps, he might even be tempted by the money behind al-Qaeda. It is unlikely that he would use his nuclear weapons unless his very survival was in question, but Japan and South Korea might feel that they needed to provide their own deterrent forces just in case. <br>
					<br>
					The use of further sanctions against this bankrupt state will not change its approach. It looks as though it will now be very difficult to put the nuclear genie back in the North Korean bottle. Kim Jong Il may calculate that he can follow Israel, India and Pakistan and become eventually accepted as a nuclear power. The lessons will not be lost on other potential nuclear states: once you have the warhead and the missile, the US has to take you seriously.We should worry that the use of nuclear weapons in the coming year is now a possibility in not just Korea, but also in the Middle East and the Indian sub-continent. And Osama bin Laden is still a threat.</font><i>Professor Sir Timothy Garden, a former air marshal, was Director of the Royal Institute of International Affairs before his current post at the Centre of Defence Studies, King's College London, where he undertakes research on transatlantic security, European defence and counter terrorism.</i></p>
