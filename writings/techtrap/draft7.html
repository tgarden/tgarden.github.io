<P>For half of the 20th Century, nuclear physics has held the prime
position as the scientific discipline which produced weapons of
unchallenged power. As a branch of theoretical physics it has made
great strides since the first development of atomic weapons. To what
extent have those subsequent discoveries had a military utility, and
what further military applications are in prospect for the future,
now that the Cold war is over?</P>

<P>The story of the development of the atomic bomb is well known. The
first experiments in radioactive decay took place at the end of the
last century. Einstein's theoretical formulation of the equivalence
of mass and energy predicted that, if mass could be converted into
energy, the atom bomb was a theoretical possibility. Atomic theory
brought new insights into the nature of the atom, and developed hand
in hand with quantum theory to predict atomic behaviour. By 1933
enough pieces of the jigsaw were there for one scientist to predict
that "a chain reaction might be set up if an element could be found
that would emit two neutrons when it swallows one neutron" (1). The
discovery that Uranium atoms did just this came in 1939, and from
then on it was as much an engineering problem as a physics problem to
produce the fission bomb.</P>

<P>Much greater mass change, and hence energy change was
theoretically possible through the fusion of lighter elements into
heavier ones, than through the fission of heavy to light. The
difficulty in fusing atoms together was that very high temperatures
were necessary to trigger the process. This was the mechanism which
fuelled the stars. The development of the thermonuclear bomb in the
early 1950s demonstrated that fusion was achievable by using a
fission weapon to provide the detonator. This meant that the yield of
any nuclear weapon could be increased virtually without limit. Less
obvious at the time, but of greater significance subsequently, has
been the ability to make nuclear weapons smaller in size and of lower
yield. The nuclear artillery shell, the missile warhead and the
multiple warhead all became possible.</P>

<P>Military needs pushed forward nuclear physics and nuclear
engineering in the early days. The construction of early nuclear
power stations stemmed from the need to produce fissile material.
Since then the fields of theoretical nuclear physics have overlapped
more and more with those of high energy physics which were considered
in Chapter 5. Nuclear tests continued, and for a brief period in the
70s the prospect of an enhanced radiation weapon (the Neutron Bomb)
excited popular interest. Nuclear physicists had not been idle in the
intervening years. The destructive power of nuclear weapons depends
on the combination of a number of different effects. Typically the
energy released by a fission type explosion is made up of 50% blast,
35% thermal radiation, 5% prompt radiation and 10% residual
radiation. If a pure fusion weapon were possible then the proportions
might be 20% blast and thermal, with the major 80% of energy being
released as prompt radiation, and very little residual radiation.
However, the pure fusion weapon is not as yet possible, and
developments aimed at altering the balance between the fission
trigger and the fusion element of the bomb have only modified the
radiation element by a small margin. The enhanced radiation 8 inch
artillery shell was claimed to only produce 10% enhancement in prompt
radiation (2). The advantages of a weapon which leaves less residual
radiation, and has a more precise blast effect, was to make its use
appear more credible to an enemy. This was seen as particularly
necessary in the case of short range weapons where the effects on
friendly forces are critical. Yet the difference between the enhanced
radiation weapon and the normal atomic shell is only at the margins.
Indeed this appears to be the difficulty in many of the possible
improvements in nuclear capabilities. Warheads can now be made as
small as necessary, with whatever yield is required, and the
development of different nuclear mechanisms seems to have little
advantage to offer. There was a time when the atomic bullet seemed a
logical development of the smaller and smaller atomic devices, but
now the strategic realities of the command and control of nuclear
weapons makes this a route of little interest.</P>

<P>The enhanced radiation weapon was seen by some to offer a
significant improvement in nuclear deterrent capability. The prompt
radiation would disable troops even in tanks, without the penalty of
collateral damage and long term radiation. One route to achieve this
would be through a pure fusion weapon. Current thermonuclear weapons
gain their energy from Lithium Deuteride producing Tritium after
irradiation by the neutrons from the Uranium or Plutonium fission
reaction; and subsequent fusing of the Tritium isotope of Hydrogen
into heavier elements. The energy in the fission bomb provides the
temperatures and pressures necessary for sufficient time to cause the
fusion process, which then releases the high energy associated with
thermonuclear devices. Much development work is in progress in the
civil sector towards taming the fusion process. As considerably more
energy is released in the fusion of atoms than is necessary to
initiate the process, there appears to be the prospect of limitless
cheap power. While success in this field would have very significant
implications for power generation (see Chapter 5), it is unlikely to
affect nuclear weapon design. The two fields, while overlapping, have
different objectives: the military seeks instantaneous fusion power;
the civil seeks controlled prolonged fusion power. Currently one area
might serve both: Laser-initiated fusion. The concentration in energy
possible with high power lasers seems to offer the prospect of
containing sufficient energy to initiate fusion. The successful
development of a civil power generator based on such a device might
well offer possibilities for a pure fusion weapon. The other routes
being followed by civil researchers follow the large scale
engineering inappropriate to weapon development.</P>

<P>While a pure fusion weapon could offer advantages in cost, size,
lack of residual radiation, and a move away from dependence on
Uranium and Plutonium, there are a number of areas for research into
improvements in the fission and fission-fusion weapons of today. The
enhanced radiation weapon has demonstrated that it is possible to
optimise the weapon for a particular form of damage (although the
other forms of damage are not eliminated. All nuclear weapons have
similar effects (3).The balance of damage caused by heat, blast and
radiation can be changed by changing the yield or by altering the
height of the detonation between a ground burst and a height at which
the fireball no longer touches the ground. Yet in every case the
energy is radiated out as an expanding sphere until it meets
resistance. A bullet is highly directional. Anti-tank shells have
shaped charges to penetrate in the direction which will give most
lethality to a tank. Mines are arranged to fire their charges up into
the vulnerable parts of vehicles. Yet nuclear weapons remain like the
cartoon anarchist's bomb: equally destructive in all directions. This
suggests that energy is wasted and collateral damage is more
difficult to control. One can visualise targets in which an asymmetry
of nuclear effect would be advantageous. A nuclear weapon designed to
destroy enemy missile silos would be improved if the nuclear effects
could be channelled forward in a cylinder with dimensions related to
the accuracy of delivery. A battlefield nuclear weapon would be
improved if all its effects could be concentrated in the enemy's
direction without danger to friendly forces. There seems no reason
why development of such asymmetries in nuclear effects could not be
developed along the lines of the shaped charges of conventional
explosives. The question is whether the advantages derived are
sufficient to outweigh the costs, both political and financial, of
such development.</P>

<P>The next area to consider for nuclear weapon development is
whether the primary and secondary effects of a nuclear explosion are
amenable to change, and if so what advantages can be gained. Looking
at the possibilities for the future, one writer (4) , in the last
days of the Cold War, identified 15 different areas where selective
enhancement of nuclear effects could improve capabilities. By
changing the average molecular weight of the materials in the weapon,
the surface area and the energy distribution, the device could be
optimised for the production of X -rays. Such a weapon detonated in
space could be used to damage ballistic missiles during their
exo-atmospheric phase and against satellites. Work had also been in
progress on the X-ray laser which would be excited by the nuclear
explosion. This would allow much greater concentration of X-ray
energy flux, assuming that it could be directed against the target in
space. X-rays are absorbed by the atmosphere, although generating an
Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) in the process. This EMP can effect
electronic devices, and radio communications. The weapon might
instead be optimised for Gamma ray, microwave, infra-red, radio
frequency or visible light emission. Such devices exploded in space
or in the atmosphere will have different characteristics. If the
radiation is focused or directed, it can be more damaging but
requires accurate control. The EMP effect can be optimised in a
number of ways. The type of fall-out could be tailored to the require
effect. The bomb debris could be transformed from the minor part it
plays currently, into a directed projectile. Were such a development
possible, a nuclear projectile (one in which the motive force is
provided by a nuclear explosion) might be able to shoot down vehicles
in space and the upper atmosphere.</P>

<P>There is therefore the possibility of a large number of avenues
for the development of nuclear weapons, and most would require
exclusively military funding. For Western nations, given the
political realities of the use on nuclear weapons, there seems little
point in devoting great resources to fields where, whatever the
military potential, the weapons could not be used. Yet neither the
end of the Cold War nor the 1995 Non Proliferation Treaty conference
have brought a worldwide diminution of interest in nuclear weapons.
France continued nuclear tests in the South Pacific, despite
worldwide condemnation. It has however said that it will accede to a
Complete Test Ban Treaty. China continues nuclear weapon tests, and
indicates that it will need to carry out peaceful nuclear explosion
in any event. Beyond the five declared nuclear states of the United
States, Russia, United Kingdom, France and China, there are a number
of other states with an interest in nuclear capability. One study (6)
identifies Israel, India and Pakistan as de facto nuclear states.
Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Germany, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Netherlands,
North Korea, South Africa, Sweden and Switzerland are all assessed as
capable of becoming nuclear weapon states relatively easily. Ukraine,
Kazakhstan and Belarus still have access to Soviet nuclear systems.
There are also concerns about the future use of nuclear material by
terrorists. Nuclear weapons therefore remain an important area of
concern for security policy, and nuclear physics will continue to
contribute to the development of defensive and offensive measures.
</P>

<P>In any analysis of the most productive areas for research in
military uses of nuclear physics, the political dimension must be
considered. The Partial Test Ban Treaty of 1963 inhibited the
development of weapons where their interaction with the atmosphere is
of a crucial importance. The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 has had a
similar effect on those nuclear weapons which capitalise on
positioning beyond the atmosphere. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty (NPT) was extended indefinitely on 11 May 1995. An important
element of the agreement was the requirement for the signing of a
Complete Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) by 1996. Nevertheless computer
modelling, using the data from recent underground nuclear tests can
produce results for some novel nuclear weapon development. In
addition, nuclear weapons can be improved, within the constraints of
a CTBT in exactly analogous ways to conventional weapons. They can be
delivered with greater accuracy over greater ranges in shorter
response times: the technologies necessary are all non-nuclear. What
nuclear physics can provide is a weapon which is optimised for
particular targets, improvements in ease of production, cost and
maintenance of the weapons, and of particular importance improved
weapon safety.</P>

<P>Within the area of target optimisation, it is likely that an
intense area for research will be the generation of electromagnetic
energy for offensive purposes. As dependence on electrical and
electronic systems increases, the vulnerability to enemy induced
failures of these systems also increases. The EMP associated with a
nuclear explosion was a cause of considerable concern during the Cold
War era of mutual deterrence, and great expenditure was incurred in
taking protective measures. The EMP effect is greatest in
exo-atmospheric or high altitude explosions. There are two different
EMP generators. The plasma passing through the earth's magnetic field
causes a broad band surge of electromagnetic radiation. In addition
the ionising of the atmosphere by gamma and X-rays produces a current
from the flow of electrons, which in turn produces electromagnetic
radiation. It is however conceivable that a weapon could be designed
to produce much more of its energy as a narrower band of
electromagnetic radiation. If the wavelength is selected so that
propagation in the atmosphere is unimpeded, then protection becomes
much more difficult, and the yield of weapons can be much reduced for
a given damage level. Microwave radiation in the centimetre
wavelength band seems particularly well suited to this role. Even a
relatively small proportion of a nuclear explosion that could be
channelled into microwave radiation could wreak havoc to computer
systems, microprocessor control systems, power sources, communication
systems, and all things electrical. This would have considerable
implications for command and control arrangements. Lack of practical
testing following a CTBT may mean that research effort in this field
will be redirected towards non-nuclear EMP generation.</P>

<P>Nuclear physics may have significant implications for nuclear
weapons is in the manufacturing processes. The relatively slow
proliferation of nuclear states has to a considerable extent been a
function of the difficulties in producing weapon grade nuclear
material, and the engineering problems in producing a reliable
weapon. The processing to separate different isotopes of Uranium has
been a complex and expensive undertaking involving a highly
specialised engineering and chemical facilities. Research into
simpler methods for normal industrial use will inevitably make the
technology available to a wider number of nations. The break up of
the Soviet Union has led to considerable concern about the potential
for smuggling of weapon grade fissile material to prospective nuclear
states. In addition the civil research into fusion power previously
discussed may lead to simpler forms of nuclear weapon, which can be
more easily manufactured. Such developments might have significant
implications for the availability of nuclear weapons. Recognising
these dangers in a world which has seen continuing conflict in the
1990's, The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists advanced its Doomsday Clock
3 minutes closer to midnight in December 1995. It had stood been put
back to 17 minutes to midnight in 1991 reflecting the end of the Cold
War. (7)</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>While there is some force in the argument that deterrence
continues to operate between states with nuclear weapons, the same is
not true for terrorist groups. It is clear that individual members of
some groups have no concern about their own or their colleagues
demise, and that they have no centre of value which can be held at
risk for deterrence purposes. What role has research to play in
countering the threat of nuclear terrorism? First, it is worth
examining the type of nuclear threat that may be made. While the
production, or theft, of an operable nuclear weapon is not to be
discounted (8), it is highly improbable, given basic security
measures that are in all States' interests. Nor would the highly
technical production methods, or the highly defended nuclear
armouries appeal to terrorist planners. Far more likely is the use of
nuclear material, in however small quantities, as a contaminant for
normal explosives. The targeting by terrorists of nuclear sites, both
civil and military, with conventional explosives is also a
possibility. Counters to all these possibilities are more in the
realm of conventional security measures than the product of nuclear
physics research.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Turning away from the weapons aspects of nuclear physics, there
are other influences which this branch of research can have on
security interests. Nuclear power has had a somewhat chequered career
in the civil sector, and the problems of safety and waste disposal
continue to cause disquiet, and hence slow the rate of development.
On the military side the cost and constraints of nuclear power
systems has restricted their use to where the operational need is
over-riding, as in nuclear submarines, or where the power required
can be produced economically, as in aircraft carriers. The
developments in controlled fusion power already discussed may change
the balance of advantage both in the civil and military sectors. This
however is in the longer term, and currently the size of potential
fusion power generators gives little hope for them being integrated
into mobile systems. In any event, the research being undertaken in
the civil sector will allow the military possibilities to be
anticipated.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>One aspect of nuclear power which does have strategic implications
is the use of civil nuclear power stations as targets. The
destruction of such a facility by conventional weapons would allow an
enemy to generate many of the effects of a nuclear strike, without
using nuclear weapons. The long term and widespread effects of the
fire at the Chernobyl plant in 1986 indicated what a major disaster
could be caused by a damaged nuclear power station. Two connected
areas of research can thus be useful: one offensive and one
defensive. Custom made conventional weapons designed to cause a
nuclear power plant to run out of control would be complex, and would
depend on the design of the various safety features in the target.
The destruction of the protective containment vessel would stop power
production and cause local contamination. For a Chernobyl-scale
effect, the safety features must be countered. This then leads to
consideration of defences against such weapon developments by a
potential enemy. There are passive measures such as the siting of
power stations in isolated locations, and taking regard of prevailing
winds. These are sensible precautions in any event. What is also
necessary at the design stage of any nuclear power station is
consideration of the redundancy and hardening of all safety features
against a conventional weapon attack. In this regard over-insurance
is to be encouraged, as modifications at a later stage will be very
difficult. The use of nuclear power stations as weapons which bridge
the nuclear threshold may have received insufficient attention in the
past.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In summary, despite the important contribution that nuclear
physics has made to weapon development in the past, it looks as
though its future military application is much more limited. If the
hopes of the NPT are fulfilled, there will be a continuing decline in
the utility of nuclear weapons.</P>
