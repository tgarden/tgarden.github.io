<P>	There is something slightly bizarre in the prospect of the
smallest fundamental particles of matter being employed to destroy
the most powerful weapons which man can build. Modern physics has
been a story akin to the opening of an endless series of Russian
dolls. The discovery of the atomic nature of matter at the start of
the last century was an immensely important achievement. John
Dalton's experiments on the chemical composition of compounds
revealed that there were atomic building blocks  from which all
substances derived.  The ordering of the elements into a structured
table by Mendeleyev in 1869, where properties could be predicted and
missing elements identified, gave great confidence to scientists that
they had discovered the true nature of matter. But the very
predictability of the elements when tabulated by their atomic weight
suggested some finer structure to their composition. This century the
structure of the atom has been explored. Initially it seemed
relatively simple. The less than a hundred elements could be
explained by suitable combinations of smaller building blocks:
electrons, protons and neutrons. In recent years the number of these
sub-atomic particles, which have been identified, has grown until
they are as numerous as the elements. The simple triad of particles
has been joined by the neutrino, photon, muon, pion, kaon and many
others. Just as the periodic table of the middle of the last century
made it possible to predict undiscovered elements, so the start of
attempts to classify the sub-atomic particles has led to prediction
and discovery of previously unknown particles. This in turn has led
to attempts to look for some fine structure to the elementary
particles, and the search for quarks- the building blocks of
subatomic particles.(1) </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	All this pure physics research has required higher and higher
energy particle accelerators to investigate the fundamental nature of
matter. Indeed, the term 'particle' is no more than a convenient
label for the reader. The physicists are not investigating particles
in the sense of grains of sand, but are measuring phenomena which can
be identified by mass and energy level, and by effects on other
'particles'. In the search for simplicity of cause, atomic theory led
to the identification of more than 100 elements, and  many isotopes
of those atoms. The simple structure underlying the atoms has grown
more complex until there are more than 100 sub-atomic particles. 
</P>

<P>The investigations of physicists have identified four different
types of force which control the interation of matter. Gravity is the
one which affects us in the normal world, but it is remarkably weak
compared to the three other fundamental forces. These are the
electromagnetic force, the weak nuclear force and the strong nuclear
force. Investigations into the nature of these forces, and how they
may be related to each other, have also required bigger and bigger
accelerators and the science of high energy physics is one of the
major international areas of collaboration because of the high costs
of the equipment involved. Research must be devoted into the design
of the accelerators and into the power sources for them. Even with
such collaboration, the rising cost of such pure research sets
limits. At a late stage in the building of the 'Superconducting Super
Collider' (an accelerator some 20 times more powerful than the
largest existing machine), it was cancelled despite some $2 billion
already spent.(2)</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>One  major area for research into this field is in the search for
fusion power. While current atomic energy is derived from the
radioactive decay of atoms, this in nuclear terms releases only a
small proportion of the energy locked in the nuclear structure. Our
sun is able to burn for millions of years by fusing light atoms into
heavier ones and releasing much greater amounts of fusion energy. In
order to generate the necessary conditions for atomic fusion, a
concentration of very high energy particles must be achieved. The
necessary energy levels at sufficient concentrations are achieved  in
the middle of an atomic bomb. The atomic fission explosion provides
the firelighter for the fusion process in thermonuclear weapons. A
great deal of civil research effort is being expended on the search
for a way to produce the necessary conditions in a more controlled
way through accelerated particles confined in magnetic bottles. This
line of civil energy research brings more expertise to bear on the
problems of producing very high energy particle beams, and also the
control of those beams to precise criteria . The research has been
progressing for four decades and demonstrated the production of some
10 million watts of fusion power sustained for half a second in a
1994 experiment.(3) </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>One  area of high energy physics research which has implications
for the military use is that of laser research. The laser was
initially an interesting demonstration of the discrete nature of
energy states in matter. Changes from one energy state to another in
an atom are accompanied by emission or absorption of radiation. The
discreteness of the energy states is characterised by the associated
radiation being of a single frequency. Just as a small sound picked
up by a microphone near to a loudspeaker builds up to a loud squeal
of feedback, so a small pulse of light reflected back into the laser
material produces an amplification of the radiation through further
emission, which produces in turn an intense 'squeal' of laser light.
The light, or other radiation, produced has curious properties (4).
It is coherent in nature. As a result of it being produced at a
single frequency, with all the waves in step with one another, the
beam spreads very little with distance, and can be focused to give
intense energy concentrations. While initially a scientific novelty,
the increasing power of lasers has made them important tools in
investigating the nature of matter, as well as an increasing number
of industrial applications. They are also being used in research into
power from nuclear fusion.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In the military field, high energy particle beams and high energy
lasers offer the prospect of a new class of firepower: Directed
Energy Weapons. Science fiction writers have always been attracted to
the prospect of instantaneous death rays. This does not mean that
they necessarily offer any advantages over the more mundane methods
of destruction. For directed energy to offer a useful avenue for
military research, the advantages must be demonstrable given the
costs of high energy physics research. Can directed energy weapons
offer the prospect of changing the nature of warfare in the same
sense as the repeating rifle, the aircraft, the submarine, or the
atomic weapon?</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In three areas the use of directed energy weapons appears to offer
new opportunities:</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>(a) Speed of delivery. Laser radiation travels at the speed of
light, and particle beams can be accelerated to significant fractions
of the speed of light. Thus time of flight problems of more physical
missiles are eliminated. Aiming at moving targets becomes much
simpler. Damage can be assessed and if necessary the target
re-engaged, where it might have passed beyond the operational range
of missile or gun.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>(b) Range. The range of a laser beam is theoretically infinite in
a vacuum. Despite the coherence of the radiation it does diverge, and
the power per unit area decreases with distance. The ability to focus
the beam helps, and operational ranges of 1000 km in space are
conceivable in the future. The effective range of particle beams is a
complex issue, which is discussed further below.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>(c) Logistics. At first inspection, the use of massless photons of
light, or streams of protons, in place of heavy shells or missiles
seems to solve the logistic supply problem of modern warfare at a
stroke. Unfortunately, the energy requirements must be met from some
fuel sources, and the overall logistic bill must be considered
carefully in any proposed system.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>These three factors are sufficiently important for serious
consideration to be given to the role of directed energy weapons in
future warfare.  But before deciding on their deployment, the
physical constraints on their operations must also be examined.
Particle beams can be of two types: charged using electrons or
protons; or neutral using neutrons or hydrogen atoms. An electron
beam system is commonplace in the home today. The television cathode
ray tube is a particle beam accelerator. Electrons are produced from
a heated filament, are accelerated by high voltage plates, and
manipulated by electric and magnetic fields to produce a focused beam
on the surface of the television screen. Typically the electrons are
accelerated through a voltage of a few thousand volts, and are
equivalent to a current flow measured in microamps.  The enormous
research particle accelerators can achieve very high kinetic
energies. Protons are accelerated to 500 thousand million electron
volts (500 GeV) in the gigantic circular Fermi accelerator. The power
of such a beam is the product of their energy and the number of
particles produced per second. Just as a car light bulb operating at
12  volts and using 2 amps has a power of 2 x 12 = 24 watts, so our
1000 GeV accelerator with a current of 0.6 milliamps has a power of
600 Megawatts. Research into fusion reactors has produced high
current particle beams but at much lower energies. The power of a
useful beam weapon would require particles accelerated to the order
of 1 GeV at currents of 1000 amps sustained for 0.1 of a millisecond.
This represents a power of a million megawatts. No such accelerator
is yet available.(5)</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>While the power requirements for particle beam weapons are
daunting, the nature of the beam itself is also an area of
uncertainty. Charged particles can be relatively easily accelerated
and focused into a beam. However once in free flight, the repulsion
between similar charged bodies causes the beam to disperse. An
electron beam 1 cm wide as it leaves the accelerator has spread to
some 15 metres across at a range of 1000 kms; and a similar proton
beam would be 18 kms wide. Beam dispersion of that size makes the
optimistic assumption that the path is in free space without an
external magnetic field. A charged particle beam travelling in the
atmosphere or in the earth's magnetic field would be dispersed or
deflected to an extent which would make long range use impossible.
The use of neutrally charged particle beams would overcome both the
electrical and magnetic deflection effects, but brings with it new
problems. The particles must start with an electrical charge, so that
they can be accelerated and focused. Then the beam must be
neutralised, which causes some spreading which continues to increase
with distance. At a nominal 1000 km a neutral beam might be expected
to have diverged to about 20 metres across, assuming that the source
charged particle beam could be kept focused to an accuracy of 1 part
in a million. </P>

<P>	Our theoretical particle beam weapon would aim to produce
sufficiently energetic particles at the target to penetrate its
protective outer layer, and in sufficient concentration to damage the
internal electronics or even detonate any high explosive warhead. The
propagation difficulties are at their least in space, and so particle
beam weapons seem to offer attractions for anti-ballistic missile and
anti-satellite systems. However the sheer size of the accelerators,
and the prodigious power requirements, coupled with the precise
control needed in an unpredictable magnetic environment, makes the
particle beam weapon in space based on current developments unlikely
to be a productive avenue of research. In the atmosphere, propagation
over relatively short distances may be possible by boring an
evacuated channel in the air with a high power laser, before sending
the particle beam down it. This might have applications for the short
range interception of incoming missiles. It is comparable to firing a
tank gun through a brick wall so that you can fire a bullet through
the resulting hole. If a high power laser can produce such a
controllable effect, then it can be used as the weapon itself. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>At the current stage of research into accelerated particle beams,
their application as weapons seems remote. They could provide
destructive firepower, but at a considerably greater cost than more
conventional means. There are also a number of relatively low cost
countermeasures which can be taken to disperse the beam before it
strikes the target, or reduce the effect if it does strike home. This
is not to say that at some stage in the future, particle beams may
not have a role to play. Fortunately there are so many industrial and
pure physics research projects driving the development of particle
beam accelerators that work will continue apace without needing
military prompting. If power requirements, focusing and control
mechanisms, propagation characteristics and the physical size of the
equipment change dramatically under civilian approach, then it will
be time for military applications to be reviewed. Until then particle
beam weapons offer little save novelty to defence.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	The laser does not suffer from the magnetic and electric
dispersion problems of particle beams. Widespread publicity has
accompanied the testing of high energy lasers against drones. It is
already possible to provide sufficient energy in a laser beam at
short range to destroy a military target in clear atmospheric
conditions. This does not necessarily mean that the laser is the best
way to destroy such targets. A surface to air missile, or a radar
laid antiaircraft gun can also do the job. Any laser weapon would be
different in nature from other  weapons. Its destructive power would
be in the form of electromagnetic radiation. It would deliver its
destruction at the speed of light, some 300 million metres per second
or 100,000 times faster than a missile. It must also be aimed to
strike the target, and held on the target for long enough to cause
the necessary damage. In the atmosphere, the power of the laser beam
is limited by the electrical breakdown of the air at high energy
concentrations. It is also attenuated by dust, smoke, cloud or any
medium which obscures radiation at that wavelength. While the classic
demonstrations of lasers burning holes in razor blades suggest a
mechanism for destruction of targets based on melting, this is
unlikely to be the most efficient use. By pulsing the laser into high
energy bursts of radiation, it is possible to cause damage to target
aircraft or missiles by cracking. If the pulse rate is high enough,
the thermal effect assists the fracturing process. This process is
helped when the target material is already under stress, as it would
be in a missile in flight. In the atmosphere the range would be
limited both by the atmospheric conditions, and the power density
limitations. In space, these limitations are relaxed while the
necessary ranges are increased dramatically. Now the constraints
become design problems for generating and focusing the laser power
necessary. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The laser is already a useful military tool.  Low power lasers are
widely used on the battlefield. As a rangefinder, the laser provides
instantaneous and accurate information for weapon aiming
calculations. This task can be done by optical or radar sighting
methods, but the laser gives much more precise measurements and is
much less prone to enemy counter-measures. It is possible to conceive
of further developments in this area leading towards a laser based
radar system. A relatively low power laser with a scanning mirror,
coupled to an electro-optical detection system could provide a
precise three dimensional picture of target location, with far
greater discrimination of detail than radar. It could be more
difficult to detect and jam given the availability of tuneable lasers
and filters. The overwhelming disadvantage of such a system would be
the problems of propagation in obscured atmospheric conditions.
However, developments in higher frequency lasers in the ultra-violet
and beyond regions of the electromagnetic spectrum may bring new
possibilities in this application.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	One particular such application has already been considered.
The oceans currently provide an excellent obscuring medium for
military covert activities. The detection of submarines is still as
much an art as a science. The oceans are vast hiding places, with the
propagation of both sound and electromagnetic radiation subject to
anomalies as the waves pass through the differing layers of water.
Nevertheless, it has been reported that laser interferometry has been
successfully used to detect submarines(6). Given the importance of
strategic submarine detection to super-power nuclear retaliatory
capability, this has been an area of intense research activity. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The laser is widely used today as a target designator for
precision guided munitions. If a target can be illuminated by a beam
of laser light, a missile or shell with a relatively low cost
terminal guidance system can home on to the characteristic
illuminated spot, and hit the target accurately. This has great
attractions to the soldier. The difficulties in passing instructions
from the front line to the close air support aircraft, or the fire
support artillery battery are overcome. The general area of the
target is sufficient, provided that the target is marked by the hand
held laser. It can also be used by the weapon operator as an
alternative means of guidance to control wire, radio beam, or radar.
The system is well proven, and future development work is needed in
improving the method of designation. Currently, the laser operator
must be within line of sight of the target, which is by definition a
somewhat vulnerable location, whether from the ground or in the air.
It is likely that these target designation tasks will be possible
from cheap unmanned Remotely Piloted Vehicles (RPVs) in the future.
The operator can be located safely to the rear of the action, select
targets from information relayed by the RPV, and lock the laser
illuminator on target. Artillery, surface-to-surface or air-to-ground
missiles can then home on the illuminated target. The advantages with
such an approach are that the lowest cost items are placed at
greatest risk, where the high cost men and machines have reduced
exposure to the enemy, while the high kill rates of precision guided
munitions are achieved.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Lasers are also in use as means of communication. The
electromagnetic radiation in a laser beam is different from a radio
wave only in being of higher frequency. The information capacity
which a radio wave can carry depends on its frequency. The higher the
frequency, the more information in the form of communication
channels, which can be carried. The tight beam of a laser is also far
more difficult to interfere with through jamming. While a piece of
thin card placed between the beam would stop communication, placing
the card is far more difficult than the blanket high power radio
jamming which is possible. In the same way, there is no spillover of
radiation which can be detected, used for intelligence or position
finding. The disadvantages of modulated laser communication systems
are those of the propagation of lasers in the atmosphere. This can be
overcome by the use of fibre optics, which pipe the light with much
less attenuation just as a wire can carry telephone communication. In
looking at communication on the future battlefield, a system which
was proof against the hostile electronic warfare environment would be
a great asset. The technical problems of using lasers are
considerable for mobile manpack systems. Yet low cost relay masts
with automatic orientation might offer possibilities. At sea, data
transmission by such means might offer advantages, and relay through
satellite retransmission could offer great flexibility.</P>

<P>	One other current offshoot of the laser will certainly have
some military applications.  The coherent predictable nature of laser
light allows photographs to be taken, which can reconstruct the
original waveforms when re-illuminated by a laser. The holograms
produced are three dimensional pictures in a true sense, in that a
photographed object can be viewed from different positions. While
current applications seem more artistic than scientific, the
possibility of much more realistic simulation, and instrumentation
through holographic processes will bring the laser into another area
of military development.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Moving away from the low powered laser and into more powerful
offensive use of laser weapons, power levels for damage to the human
eye and to optical sensors are relatively easy to achieve. Blinding
the pilot of a modern aircraft through a laser eye damage weapon,
would be an effective method of destroying the aircraft. However, it
is not as simple as might at first be thought. The laser which is
focused by the lens in the eye on to the retina, must be powerful
enough to burn the retina over the time the beam is held on target.
The target is remarkably small compared to the aircraft, and is
obscured by the aircraft canopy and the pilot's visor. Given also the
propagation problems of lasers in the smoke of the battlefield, the
laser eye  damage weapon is unlikely to be worth developing as a
primary air defence system, even its use was considered permissible
under the emerging views of the conduct of war.  If an air defence
gun is fitted with a laser rangefinder, then some states may consider
it worth increasing the power levels so that eye damage becomes
possible. This will force the opposition into taking protective
measures which will degrade the overall mission effectiveness.  The
same line of argument holds for damaging sensor systems, particularly
fitted to aircraft.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	One class of sensors do offer opportunities for laser
countermeasures. These are the reconnaissance satellites. Predictable
targets free from the problems of the atmosphere, with extremely
sensitive sensors are particularly vulnerable to laser damage. Such
damage can be covert, as the satellite will continue to orbit while
blinded. The offensive laser could be earth-based, aircraft-borne or
deployed in space. Since the sensors are likely to be oriented
towards the earth beneath, the target area for the reconnaissance is
also the best area for deployment of the offensive laser. Use of a
high flying aircraft with such a system allows considerable
flexibility, and reduces the atmospheric absorption problems. Such
systems would appear to have considerable potential.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Looking to yet higher powers for lasers, the target set is similar
to that considered in the analysis of the prospects for particle beam
weapons. Satellites, missiles and aircraft are the prime candidates
for an operational laser weapon system. The problems of propagation
in obscured atmospheric conditions would make the laser an unreliable
weapon. If the weather has to be fine, and smoke can obscure not just
vision but also killing power, then the laser is unlikely to become
the ray gun of tomorrow's infantry. While the photons in the beam may
be massless, the equipment necessary to generate the power, and the
fuel to provide the energy, both have traditional logistic penalties.
Basing laser weapons in space has great attractions in allowing long
distance propagation with little attenuation. The power generation
and fuel requirements become even more difficult to achieve. One
analysis (7) concluded that it would take 125 years to deliver the
fuel necessary for a laser weapon system designed to cope with the
Soviet ICBM threat. The study pointed out that the laser power
necessary was beyond technical possibility currently. A lesser
problem would be a laser system to destroy satellites. Given that a
space-based system would itself be vulnerable to a similar enemy
system, an aircraft carried system would again have attractions. The
copious writings (8) on complex laser weapons using enormous mirrors
in space have yet to show them to be attractive options. While the
problems of weight and size of power supplies, and the fuel
requirements, could be overcome by a ground fixed laser site focused
on a space mirror, the increasing number of critical points also
increases the overall vulnerability of such a weapon system.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Looking to yet more powerful lasers of the future (9), research
continues into higher frequency and greater power regions. Chemical
lasers, using hydrogen or deuterium and fluorine as fuels, have been
reported as achieving outputs greater than one megawatt, but that is
likely to be the limit.  Excimer krypton-fluoride lasers are higher
frequency but still four orders of magnitude below power requirements
for ballistic missile defence systems. Free electron lasers have the
advantage of being tuneable so that the best frequency for
propagation can be chosen, but the high powers come at the lower
frequencies. This can be used to advantage as a high power radio
frequency weapon, by using microwave energy to disrupt communications
systems or cause local heating (10).  The X-ray laser using a nuclear
explosion as the source of energy is one possible avenue. While this
might overcome some of the problems of sheer mass of fuel supplies in
space, it introduces new difficulties. The large number of potential
targets in any ballistic missile defence make a weapon, which
self-destructs with a nuclear explosion each time it is fired, an
expensive option. Indeed the precise aiming required might well be
difficult to achieve under such circumstances.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Lasers offer less exciting prospects for future weapon systems
than many would suggest. As components of various systems, they will
be increasingly used for the unique characteristics which coherent
radiation offers. They are already in use for communication, weapon
aiming and target marking. For little extra development they could
add eye damage and sensor damage capabilities. As high energy
destructive weapons, the physical limitations associated with beam
generation is likely to restrict them to relatively few target types.
Satellites may be the most vulnerable laser weapon targets, and the
weapon would be best operated from high flying aircraft.  Just as
civil research into particle beams will ensure that technological
surprise is unlikely to be achieved by a potential enemy, so it is
with laser research. The industrial and domestic use of lasers from
the compact disc player to the laser fusion reactor will keep
research going. More military applications will undoubtedly be found,
but they as many will  emerge from civil research projects rather
than dedicated military research.</P>
