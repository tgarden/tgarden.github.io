<P>The Gaudy is the main activity of the year. Held at College, its
core is lunch, the AGM and afternoon tea, a discussion on important
issues for the College and may include a concert in the Jacqueline du
Pr&eacute; Music Building. In alternate years, a Gaudy dinner usually
rounds off the evening. The weekend can continue to include a Sunday
morning seminar on topical issues. The next Gaudy is on 23/24
September 2000.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Two meetings are held in London every year, the Autumn Drinks
Party, which is held on a Thursday evening in November for people
working in and around London and Senior Members who might be able to
make a trip to London. The next one will be on 9 November 2000. The
other  London event is the long-standing London Tea Party Meeting
which combines an interesting talk, followed by a relaxed get
together over afternoon tea. Recent talks have included P.D. James on
detective story writing and the TV news reporter Sue Lloyd-Roberts.
The next London meeting is on 23 February 2000 at 3pm at St Alban's
Centre, Baldwin's Gardens, London EC1, when the speaker will be
Professor Susan Greenfield (1970-73). </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Other events, arranged from time to time in reponse to the wishes
and suggestions of members, include subject/profession conferences
and seminars, literary lunches and dinners and purely social
gatherings.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Some events eg. the Gaudy Dinners and special conferences, are
restricted to Senior Members, but families and friends are always
welcome at many events such as lunches, garden parties, concerts,

<BLOCKQUOTE><H3><CENTER>Reunions</CENTER></H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The ASM and the College encourage reunions, usually taken for the
year of coming up, i.e. matriculation, or by subject. Fiftieth,
twenty-fifth and decade anniversary lunches or dinners have proved
the most popular to date. The Office will help with all the
arrangements, from the mailing to the meal and will be very pleased
to assist if you wish to initiate a reunion.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Also encouraged and organized by the Office is a reunion lunch for
those who have just become eligible to receive the M.A.</P>
