			<h4>International collaboration - why bother?</h4>
			<h4>by Tim Garden<b>&nbsp;</b></h4>

			<p>&nbsp;It is not so many years ago that any major British military equipment project would inevitably mean a competition between different UK manufacturers, and even the production of a variety of solutions. When a strategic nuclear bomber was needed after the World War 2, the Valiant, the Victor and the Vulcan were all three brought into service. When looking for an air defence fighter, Britain could fund the Swift, the Hunter, and the Lightning. As real costs rose in the post war era, this multiple solution approach became less and less affordable at the high technology end.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Most of the next generation of combat aircraft could not be developed&nbsp; solely as national projects: the market was too small and the costs too high. Collaboration with allies was seen as the way forward. The Anglo-French Jaguar, the three nation Tornado and the four nation Eurofighter are products of this approach. Even the successful UK Harrier required US collaboration for the next generation.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Collaboration is not a panacea. Certainly, it increases the assured market size, and amortises the research and development costs across a larger number of units. It brings work to national aerospace companies. It also makes the politics of any subsequent cancellation much more difficult. Yet cost pressures do not disappear. Multi-national projects move at the speed of the slowest partner, and are inevitably more complex to manage. The long procurement times add a new twist to the inflationary spiral, and members of the partnership then look for ways to reduce numbers or capabilities.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The rational way to purchase a defence capability would be to specify the military effect required, and to ask industry to tender in straight international&nbsp; competition. The contract would then be given to the company which quoted the lowest&nbsp; guaranteed price for the required military effect. This would not</p>
			<p>prevent international collaboration, but would put the onus on industry rather than government to arrange collaboration.&nbsp; European governments worry that this approach would lead to complete dominance of the defence market by US companies.&nbsp; The large domestic military market in the US allows economies of scale, which make them more competitive.</p>
			<p>Yet the EU is not that different in scale from the US. It may currently only spend half as much on defence, but that is still nearly $200 bn in these days of a strong Euro. The problem is that each of Europe's governments want to spend their national funds on their national industries. Only defence is allowed to be exempt from EU competition policy. As a result, it is fragmented, inefficient and uncompetitive. There is no lack of players in the defence market: Europe is over-provided with shipyards, defence manufacturers and national defence companies. Freed from these comfortable arrangements, the European defence manufacturers would have to collaborate to survive. Not all would.</p>
			<p>Governments should change their approach to the&nbsp; European defence industry. Instead of trying to shape it with hidden subsidies through preferential orders, they need to offer it attractive market opportunities. They can do this by moving forward on integration of current operational capabilities. More capable European forces will require serious investment. Defence budgets at best are held level in real terms, and this is insufficient to fund either major new capabilities, or maintain force levels over a period of time.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>There are three complementary pressures on European nations to start taking forward pooling of some force elements. First, pooling offers the opportunity for lower overhead costs, and the resources released might then be used to fund new capabilities. Second, pooling would make the new enabling capabilities more affordable on a shared basis. Thirdly, pooled forces would drive moves towards greater interoperability and common doctrine and equipment.</p>
			<p>There was never a better time for making the political focus on capability integration. Rather than wasting time and effort on wasteful collaborative procurement projects for the distant future, European leaders need to push for pooling and integration of current military capabilities. In time, as pooled equipments lead naturally to harmonised future requirements, we can expect a new European industrial focus to emerge of its own accord.</p>
			<p>International collaboration serves our security when it produces more capability at lower cost. It will only do that if we expose the defence industries of Europe to true market forces, while also providing them with a new market opportunity through integration of operational capabilities across Europe. The answer to the question &quot;Why bother?&quot; will then be very clear to the industry. It will be collaborate or die.</p>
