			<h3>Nuclear War in Asia?</h3>
			<p>by  Sir Timothy Garden</p>

			<p>The focus moves from Afghanistan to the growing tension between India and Pakistan. The two neighbours have hardly been at ease with each other over recent years, and Kashmir has been a constant source of dispute, but not the only cause for conflict. The international community has good reason to do whatever is possible to reduce the possibility of war, particularly given that both countries have an operational nuclear weapon capability. In this respect, anything that Tony Blair's visit can achieve in the reduction of tension will be worthwhile.<br>
				<br>
				In terms of conventional military assessment, there is little doubt that India is by far the more capable of the two. It spends some $US 15 bn each year on the armed forces, and this equates to 3.2% of GDP. From this, it fields nearly as many active regulars as the USA, and has an air force with more combat aircraft than the RAF. Pakistan spends only a quarter as much but that is some 5.8% of its smaller GDP. It fields forces that are about half the size of India and are equipped with older and less capable weapon systems.  In any all-out conventional war, India should be able to defeat its smaller, poorer, less capable neighbour. However both militaries are professional and good fighters, which would make any conflict very destructive. It is difficult to see any long term advantage that can be gained by either through major conventional warfare. This has not stopped them going to war in 1947, 1965, 1971 and getting close to it in 1992. There are occasional border incidents all the time, any of which could flare up into something more serious.<br>
				<br>
				The major new dimension to Indo-Pakistan relations has been the acquisition by both countries of nuclear weapons. Under Nehru, a joint Canada-India reactor became operational in 1960. With a second research reactor in 1961 and a plutonium plant completed in 1964, the Indians had a sound base for nuclear weapon production. The Sino-Indian conflict of 1962, the Chinese nuclear test in 1964, and the war with Pakistan in 1965 produced a strong body of opinion favouring nuclear weapons for India. On 18 May 1974, an underground test &quot;Peaceful Nuclear Explosion&quot; of a Hiroshima-sized device was successfully carried out. If India has been stockpiling nuclear weapons, it could have produced perhaps as many as 200 warheads or bombs. It has an aircraft delivery capability  and has been developing its satellite and missile technology to pose a deterrent threat to China. In tests on 11 and 13 May 1998, five devices were tested and included thermonuclear, fission and low yield warheads.<br>
				<br>
				India has a much longer involvement in atomic energy than Pakistan. Given the lack of civil atomic expertise, Pakistan has found it more difficult to develop a broad weapons programme. It sought to follow the plutonium route, but once this became clear to the international community, then assistance was reduced and had ceased by 1976.  It switched to the uranium enrichment.   The United States took a number of  embargo measures to prevent the transfer of nuclear technology to Pakistan by third parties between 1976 and 1985. However economic and military assistance was restored following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. President Zia used the more relaxed international regime as an opportunity to move the nuclear weapons programme forward. The export controls on nuclear related technology from the West increased Pakistan&#146;s dependence for help from China, which has a common interest in neutralising the Indian nuclear threat. Chinese assistance was obtained for the uranium enrichment operation. The decision to demonstrate its nuclear capability by testing was in direct response to the Indian tests. Pakistan needed to show its own population that it was able to deter an Indian nuclear threat. Given the disparity of the military capabilities between the two states, it is likely that Pakistan also sees nuclear weapons as compensation for conventional force weakness. The Pakistan nuclear test took place on 28 May 1998 just two weeks after the first Indian test. They claimed to have detonated five devices although seismic data suggests it may have been three explosions.<br>
				<br>
				Their nuclear capabilities should act as a mutual restraint on allowing conflict to escalate. However neither nuclear arsenal has the control mechanisms that the five original nuclear powers have in place. With a relatively small capability in Pakistan, there may also be a temptation for early use, rather than risk a pre-emptive strike by India. Into this dangerous nuclear balance is added the real problem of Islamic terrorism. The current flare up results from suicide attacks on the Indian parliament. Just as in the Israel/Palestine situation, extremists can undermine any peace process, so they can between India and Pakistan. After, General Musharraf's support of the US operation against al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, there will be plenty of Islamic fundamentalists ready to stir up conflict. Nor will they  fear causing a nuclear war.<br>
