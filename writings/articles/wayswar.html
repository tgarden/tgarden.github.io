<P>The Cold War is over and globalisation is the buzz word of the
age. Yet fighting wars continue to flare up; and British forces are
even now poised to bomb Iraq if the Government deems it necessary.
Universal peace seems as far away as ever. Is it a hopeless dream?	
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The words "War and Peace" dominate the cover of this massive tome.
The book shop browser might be excused confusion  with Count
Tolstoy's  great work.  However, Professor Doyle  takes the serious
academic approach to explaining the possible theories of why mankind
keeps on with fighting wars. This is not a book for the dilettante:
it is a fairly comprehensive survey of the classic theorists from
Thucydides to Marx. He approaches the task by describing the strands
of thought within the schools of Realism, Liberalism and Socialism. 
His aim is show the usefulness of these different approaches to
international political theories. He warns the reader that theory
cannot provide a recipe for the conduct of either just or effective
foreign policy. Yet we must hope to come to a better understanding of
why mankind seems prepared to engage in the wholesale destruction of
war with such willingness.</P>

<P>Having stated that most international relations scholars are
Realists, Doyle declares that the philosophical foundations of
Realism are unduly obscure. He  is happy to take on the task of
shedding light through heavily footnoted  reviews of the works of
Thucydides, Machiavelli, Hobbes and Rousseau.  He argues that
Realists share a sceptical view of  all schemes for moving towards a
peaceful international order. The critical stages in the
Peloponnesian Wars are catalogued, and the possible factors which led
to the defeat of Athens give a rich vein for debate. Machiavelli's
theories are  illustrated by a modern Prince: Saddam Hussein. The
necessary qualities are a reputation for ruthlessness, rapid
execution of oppressive acts, dominance of rival factions, and a
policy of prestige and imperialism directed towards neighbours.
Consideration of the mutual insecurity of Hobbesian sovereigns leads
Doyle into describing modern examples through game theory. His
conclusion, that Hobbes would advocate preventive wars, has echoes in
the recent UN debates over action against Iraq.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>It is with some relief that we turn from this pessimistic outlook
for the world to the school of Liberalism. In this section we are
deluged with the ideas of Locke, Bentham, Smith, Schumpeter and Kant.
Doyle points out that the centrality of individual rights, private
property and representative government makes Liberalism a domestic,
rather than international, theory. Liberal societies can compete or
co-operate to become rich without expecting to have to resolve their
competition through war. Schumpeter declares in 1919 that, where free
trade prevails, no class has an interest in forcible expansion as
such. Adam Smith does a cost benefit analysis of war, and warns that
manufacturing societies are natural prey for more militaristic rural
states.  Kant, writing in 1795, describes confidence building
principles which can lead to international peace and sound entirely
appropriate today.  </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Doyle  points to the growth in modern times of alliances of
Liberal states. Here is the possibility of global peace as the number
of such states increase. Yet, the record of the last two centuries
shows a remarkable willingness among the democratic states to
initiate war against totalitarian regimes. With the end of the Cold
War, we seem to have moved into the age of  Liberal states. They will
not go to war with one another, but are ever ready to go to war with
non-Liberal states. Democracy may be the engine of peace, but global
peace will have to wait until all states are democracies.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Doyle moves on to consider, more briefly, the third of his major
schools of thought, Socialism. Marx, Engels and Lenin march across
the text, but  their ideas are greeted without any great enthusiasm.
He is eager to look at how states should behave today.  Ethical
foreign policy is very much in vogue. Beneficence and equality are
the guiding principles: as much good and as little evil as we can
afford. Yet international law is not without its difficulties.
Traditionally, it prohibits intervention in the internal affairs of
other states. This custom is important for encouraging order in a
world which lacks a global government. He explores at length the
arguments for and against the US intervention in Grenada in 1983.
Realists, Liberals and Socialists are all less than consistent on the
principle of non-intervention when it suits them. Ethical foreign
policy must also consider how to deal with global economic disparity.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Drawing the threads together in such a work is bound to be
difficult. Doyle attempts to do it by projecting forward the futures
that each of his three schools of thought might generate. The
Realists see the new world order as a reforming of the classical
balance of power. The United States will not be left as the single
superpower. Europe, Japan, China and Russia will provide the new
balancing powers. Liberalism sees the triumph of democracy and market
forces. All states are Liberal republican by 2100, and perhaps much
earlier. Global peace is possible. The Socialists have lost their
vision for the future. Wealth disparities may generate conflict, but
Marxism has little in the way of alternative outcomes. In the closing
pages, we address the impact of religions for the first time. It is
strange that such an ancient, and enduring, cause of conflict is
given so little space. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>This will certainly be a required book on the reading list for
International Relations students. It provides the source material for
erudite essays collected conveniently in one place. I am less sure
that it is a satisfying read for a wider audience. Thucydides is
quoted: "My work is not a piece of writing designed to meet the taste
of an immediate public, but was done to last forever." Perhaps that
is Doyle's hope as well. </P>
