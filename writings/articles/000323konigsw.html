<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	What a great year and a bit it has been
for the European Foreign &amp; Security Policy wonks. Much of the
exciting flurry of activity has only been possible because of a
significant change in the position and enthusiasm of the United
Kingdom Government towards greater defence cooperation in Europe.
From the St Malo meeting in December 1998, through an important
Anglo-Italian summit in July 1999, to the second Anglo-French meeting
of November 1999, we have seen a strengthening of British resolve to
make Europe more effective in its defence capabilities. The Kosovo
operation proved, if there was ever any doubt, that European nations
lack the offensive airpower capability for NATO's new role, and that
they were no better prepared to mount a potentially hostile ground
campaign.   In December, the European Council at Helsinki agreed to
establish defence capabilities to enable them to conduct EU-led
operations .The Joint Declaration looks to EU members cooperating to
provide a rapidly deployable and sustainable force up to Corps level
with all the necessary command,control and intelligence capabilities,
logistics, combat support, service support and appropriate naval and
air combat forces. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	At one level, this is a sensible attempt
to make some progress in harmonising defence effort across the EU so
that it can at least generate a useful force of 60,000 men out of its
2 million troops. It also gives a welcome impetus for the development
of some key capabilities such as intelligence and strategic airlift.
What it does not do is generate a single extra soldier, tank,
aircraft or ship. It gives the free-rider nations in Europe an
opportunity to run their defence forces down further by concentrating
only on their contribution to this new force. Years of experience at
fudging goals in the NATO force planning process  give little hope of
achieving the Corps capability easily or in full.  However, it does
at least start putting in place some structures to look at developing
real new capabilities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	What is needed urgently are some practical
moves to get better value from the 170 Bn Euros that EU nations waste
on defence every year. In a Europe where sovreignty wasn't such a
hang-up, I could imagine Javier Solana, with wise advice from George
Robertson, doing a full Strategic Defence Review which ensured that
European forces were structured sensibly to support European and NATO
needs.  As one business man said to me last month, if we ran our
operation the way Europe does defence, we would be bankrupt. It is
ripe for rationalisation and flattening of management layers. However
in the real world, this is some decades away. This is not as reason
to do nothing. In NATO  AWACs we have a good example of how an
expensive, but important, capability can be afforded if it is
operated at the supranational level. Nobody gets excited about
sovereignty, and all NATO members both contribute to and benefit from
this shared capability. There are many possible areas where such an
approach could be used. Time will only let me give you a quick taste
of some examples.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Europe needs an air transport capability.
Some ten EU nations operate C130 Hercules military transport aircraft
. It would be possible to imagine a pooled fleet of 70 aircraft,
which would look after all the national  C130 needs of  Belgium,
Denmark, Italy, Netherlands, Spain , Sweden   and Portugal, and to
which France, the UK and Greece might provide a partial contribution 
from their larger fleets. For those nations that were prepared to put
all of their C130 fleets into a common pool, there would be
significant savings in operating costs. They would also have a much
better assurance of availability on a day to day basis, given the
ability to plan routine servicing across a larger fleet. For Europe
there would be a usable airlift capability for humanitarian
operations as well as for use within NATO. This is quite different
from  multinational forces as it requires a single headquarters and a
single support and maintenance structure. Nations would be able to
close down their expensive national establishments and use the money
saved to buy new capabilities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">A similar approach would work well for an EU
air-to-air refuelling force - particularly if it were operated by a
commercial company, as is currently under consideration for the
UK.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"> Five EU nations are ordering the
Eurofighter for delivery from 2002 onwards. Each nation will set up
its headquarters for planning and support, a training base, and a
myriad of support organisations. Over a period of years, each nation
will change its version of Eurofighter in different ways (just as we
have seen with the Tornado). Interoperability will get worse as time
goes on, unless there is common management and doctrine. This is a
role for a single EU military headquarters, which would operate an EU
mixed nationality Eurofighter force of perhaps 400 aircraft. If any
nation still felt the need to retain some independent national
capability, it could rotate crews and aircraft through the EU force
on a regular basis. Beyond Eurofighter, France, Italy, Spain and the
UK want to keep in the aircraft carrier game. The UK  can only afford
an inadequate force of two carriers. Between them, the maritime
minded nations of the EU could field a serious  capability of 4 or 5
carriers supported by the frigates, submarines, helicopters and mine
counter-measure vessels provided by other EU nations. For the armies
of Europe, the need is for rapidly deployable forces with a range of
capabilities. The EU could set the guidelines to produce a well
balanced force structure.    </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	As the EU moved along these paths, it
would be important to ensure that there was no free ride for less
enthusiastic members. The establishment of a European Defence Budget
would be an early priority and would force member nations to take a
serious interest in agreeing what capability Europe needs. Nations
could then either contribute capability  or funds. This would
undoubtedly lead to a virtuous circle of  each nation volunteering
force capability, and  a realisation that they get more capability
when their defence budget supports European rather than national
forces. 	</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Finally, as forces were increasingly
operated at the European level, the common doctrine and operational
planning would lead to common equipment requirements. Role
specialisation might happen, but it would be in a planned manner
rather than the random system of today. The inefficiencies of
duplicated support that we see in today's multinational forces would
be eliminated. Europe would be a more equal partner with the United
States within NATO, and would be able to field its own diplomatic and
military capability if necessary. Nor, after restructuring costs, 
would it need to spend any more than it does in total now on defence.
 </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In summary, I welcome greatly the vigour
with which my country is approaching the development of European
defence capabilities. However, we need to apply the logic of our own
SDR to Europe as a whole, and free up the vast wasted resources by
sensible rationalisation of duplicated defence overheads.  We should
look for early opportunities to pool common capabiIties, take the
savings in overheads and spend them on such much needed things as a
European intelligence element.  It is unlikely that Defence
Ministries across the EU will be enthusiastic (turkeys don't vote for
Christmas) - but Finance Ministries should be.    </FONT></P>
