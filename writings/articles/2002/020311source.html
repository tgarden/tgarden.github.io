			<h3>Lib Dem Spring Conference</h3>
			<p>By Sir Timothy Garden</p>

			<p>The Spring Party conferences are usually shadows of the grand seaside gatherings in September. Yet the Lib Dems seem to be on something of a roll. They managed to produce an agenda full of topical issues, and to make some policy decisions which will show they are able to offer new approaches.  The main debates at Manchester were on public services, faith schools, defence and drugs. The proposal to legalise cannabis took the headlines, and that debate was certainly the highlight of the weekend. <br>
				<br>
				The ultra modern hall at Manchester's GMEX centre was so full that delegates were literally standing in the aisles. The policy paper on drug law reform was entitled &quot;Honesty, Realism, Responsibility&quot;. It offered options for the decriminalisation of the possession of any drug, or a more cautious move which retained imprisonment for possession of Class A drugs. There were strong feelings expressed by those who feared that it was a mistake to make drugs more acceptable, but they were in the minority. Most speakers were more concerned about the parallels with the era of Prohibition over alcohol sales in the USA. Crime flourished then as now with big profits being made. The drug takers are punished, police time is wasted and the pushers escape. The Lib Dems have now become the first political party in the UK to advocate decriminalisation.<br>
				<br>
				There was much talk in the bars about how to attract disenchanted Tory voters: the new drugs policy may not be that attractive to the Telegraph reader. More surprisingly, the Defence Policy Paper might prove more of a winner in that quarter. (Here your writer must declare an interest have been involved in the writing of it).  The paper, entitled Defending Democracy, recognised the need for extra resources for the armed forces to meet the many challenges, including post 11 September, that they are facing. The nuclear weapon issue was much less contentious than in previous years, and an amendment to reduce the number of Trident warheads was defeated. The overwhelming support for the new defence policy makes the Lib Dems the only party with a coherent and costed plan for UK defence in the new more dangerous world. It also makes it the first European political party to advocate increased defence spending as policy. The Government is still seeking views on how it can square the circle.<br>
				<br>
				If the two main papers achieved wide consensus among delegates, the same cannot be said on the issues of faith schools and public services. The unfairness of providing state support for faith schools, unless they are made more accessible to those of other or no faiths, taxed the delegates. Quotas were seen as impractical. There were also worries that faith schools could exacerbate divisions in communities, as has been seen in Northern Ireland.  Yet any new system would have great political problems in making necessary changes.  It was clear that the Conference would be unable to agree a single approach, and the topic was sent back for more work to be done. <br>
				<br>
				Improvement to public services was very much the theme of the Lib Dem 2001 election campaign. Now that both the Government and the Conservative Party have also made this their top priority, the Liberal Democrats wanted to flesh out the detail of their proposed reforms. A consultation document was discussed; not as a formal part of the Conference, but in order to gain policy guidance before bringing the proposals back to the main autumn gathering. The consultation session was attended by several hundred and the views ranged widely. Experience of PFI in the health sector had left many opposed to it on principle. Yet the authors were keen to look for a mix of funding approaches to public services. It will be interesting to see what the line is taken in the final document. <br>
				<br>
				In his relaxed final speech to the Conference, the Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy kept his focus on the state of the public services. His widely reported extending the hand of friendship to the Trade Unions was perhaps less exciting than expected. TUC leader John Monks spoke at the last conference at Bournemouth and it is clear they both get on well together. However, the Lib Dems are keen not to be seen as in the pocket of any special interest group, and Kennedy made that clear.<br>
				<br>
				In sum, it was a well attended gathering where the delegates took the issues seriously, debated strongly and produce some new policies. In a party which so relishes democratic debate among its members this was quite an achievement. It should have put them in good heart for the May local elections. </p>
