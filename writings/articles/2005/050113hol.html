			<h4>Eurofighter Typhoon</h4>
		</div>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>My Lords, I am grateful to the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig of Radley, for arranging this opportunity to review the progress of the introduction of Eurofighter/Typhoon into service. I must declare a past interest as I was a member of the air staff in the late 80&rsquo;s and early 90&rsquo;s under the leadership of the noble and gallant Lord, and the progress of the Eurofighter was a frequent topic of interest. Indeed the origins can be tracked back over 30 years to 1972 and the then AST403 specification for an air superiority fighter. It has been a project which has been a long time in coming to fruition, and that can be seen in the changing nomenclature of projects over the years:&nbsp; ECA (European Combat Aircraft), ECF (European Combat Fighter), ACA (Agile Combat Aircraft), EAP (European Aircraft Programme), F/EFA (Future European Fighter Aircraft), EFA (the European Fighter Aircraft), to Eurofighter, to EF2000 and now Typhoon. We had a three nation collaborative programme with France and Germany at the start, but in the end requirements differed too much. The French requirement to be able to operate from an aircraft carrier perhaps looks more foresighted now than it did then. The 80s saw&nbsp; Italy and Spain joining the partnership.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>In looking back at this long and challenging programme, we should not forget the important part played by technology demonstrators. The EAP demonstrator prototype flew in 1985 just over 2 years after the production contract was let. That demonstrator had nearly 6 years of flying, which allowed much of the development work to be tested before going final on the Eurofighter itself. It was perhaps overconfident, although it did not seem so at the time, to rename the aircraft Eurofighter 2000 in late 1992. The first development aircraft flew in 1994.&nbsp; The Tranche 1 contract was signed in late 1998, and the first instrument production aircraft flights were in April 2002. The formal delivery of&nbsp; aircraft to the four nations was in June last year, and we have now of course had all the partners sign up for the second tranche.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>My Lords, while some commentators look at this long history and discount the Eurofighter as a legacy system of the Cold War, I believe that we should be proud to have produced a very appropriate capability for the current security challenges. In the Cold War we faced a geographically well defined threat which required long range air interception. The F3 Tornado was an appropriate capability for this. Now the agile fighter with an ability to use a range of smart weapon systems is an important part of any nation&rsquo;s armoury. The long history of development and testing the technology has allowed the aircraft capability to adapt&nbsp; to the changing requirement.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>It might have been that we would have gone down the route of a very high cost stealth fighter optimised against Soviet threats. The US F/A22 Raptor is a good example of such a programme.&nbsp; In simulated combat against a Sukhoi Su-35, the F22 shoots down 10 for every one of its own losses. The figures for Eurofighter Typhoon are just under half that capability (some 4.5 Su-35s for every Typhoon lost). The next best capability is the Rafale C which loses one for one. All others (F15C, F/A-18, F16C) are worse than unity. They would be shot down more often than they would have a victory. These are unclassified results using networked simulators and give no more than indications of comparative capabilities of different aircraft with similar missile systems. But they do bear out that we are getting into service a very high performance agile fighter, at what is a good price.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Let me turn to the question of costs. Here I realise the difficulty of making useful comparisons. The ultimate unit cost of our Eurofighters is impossible to determine while there remains some doubt about the ultimate number that we will purchase. If partners were to decide to reduce, or even cancel, the third tranche, then we would need to spread the cancellation costs as well as the Research &amp; Development costs over the smaller fleet. The Austrian export version is reported to be &euro;62million a copy. I imagine that ours will work out at a little more than that taking into account development costs. Figures of around &pound;50 million seem about right given the Minister&rsquo;s statement in December about costs of tranche 2 aircraft. The US F22 programme has now ballooned to a total of $42 billion for the 276 that they originally planned to buy (or $152million each). However as we now know, that number may be reduced significantly because of costs, making each aircraft more expensive still. So despite the falling dollar, we are still looking at a capability in Eurofighter that is good value for money.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>That does not mean that we can forget about costs. In a time of enormous strain on the defence budget, I assume that the noble Lord, the Minister, will be searching for ways to keep costs down. Convincing more of our Allies to adopt the Eurofighter is one way forward. In that respect I believe we are missing a great opportunity for encouraging sales, reducing operating costs and increasing European capabilities. The four nations have now committed to nearly 400 aircraft, and with Tranche 3 this would rise to over 600. This is a serious capability for Europe, and one that the US would take notice of.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>If we looked at&nbsp; ways to operate this fleet on a more shared basis, there could be significant cost savings in maintenance, logistics and training. It would also have the advantage that smaller European air forces could operate a few aircraft within a bigger pool. Some of this opportunity has already been lost as the four nations have set up their own national arrangements. I do not doubt that in years to come, we shall be under greater resource pressure still, and looking for ways to co-operate. I would have liked to see us operate the Eurofighter force as a pooled fleet &#150; something we are prepared to do with the US for our Trident missiles &#150; but I understand the political difficulties of this. Nevertheless, we should not make it yet more difficult to share costs of ownership. Here I believe that we should learn from the Tornado aircraft experience. We had in the end to give up Tri-National Training on the Tornado at RAF Cottesmore because each nation had modified their own Tornados so much, that there was not enough commonality of the systems to make common training useful. I would ask the Minister to look hard at the advantages of keeping all nations' Eurofighters modified to a common standard, so that the advantages of shared costs can be exploited at any time in the future.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>When the Minister reports on progress of the programme, I trust that he will also include an update of the state of the simulator support. After the problems with the Apache programme over provision of simulation, we need to make sure that it is coming on stream in the right timescale. Simulation has other important benefits. The use of networked simulators will make training time much more productive. While aircrew will continue to need&nbsp; training time in the air, we have argued for many years that technology will change the balance of time in the cockpit and the simulator. This of course would have both cost and environmental benefits. Perhaps the Minister could indicate how that balance will be changed by the introduction of Eurofighter into service.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The reduction in fast jet numbers under the latest RAF draw down will presumably have eased the shortage of pilots. However, the introduction of Eurofighter while Tornado F3 continues, for some time, the continuation of Tornado GR4 and the Harrier/JSF transition will still require a long term sustainable pool of fast jet aircrew. Is the Minister content that the current plans will be able to sustain the necessary numbers? In addition, if the smaller number of aircraft are to be used efficiently, presumably there is a case for raising the aircrew to aircraft ratio. Is this being planned?</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>We on these benches very much welcome the precision attack capability development. This is not just an air superiority fighter, but will be capable of air to ground missions. This raises another question about how we organise crews. It appears that we are still looking at specialist air defence or ground attack squadrons. Is this sensible any more? Additionally are we looking at crews being multiroled rather than specialised as they have been in the past? We need to think of more imaginative approaches in the light of experiences of other nations.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Finally, can I congratulate the Minister, who has responsibility for Defence procurement, for seeing the first tranche into service and signing the contract for the second tranche. This is an important defence capability, the technology has been European developed, and the export potential is significant.</p>
