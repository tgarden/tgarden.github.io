			<h3>Taiwan Troubles</h3>
			<p>by Sir Timothy Garden</p>

			The decision on the package of US arms sales to Taiwan has come at a time of a number of interesting developments in the region. Since the return of Hong Kong and Macau to mainland China, the Chinese have been much more focused on the last remaining territory that they wish to bring back under control. However Taiwan has itself been changing. It is a successful economy, investing widely abroad. It has a vibrant democracy, where the fierceness of representative debate  makes the British parliament look gentile by comparison. At the last Taiwanese elections in March 2000, China became alarmed by the growing talk of a more independent Taiwan. Indeed, much of the current Chinese rhetoric reflects a fear that Taiwan is moving ever further away from the possibility of a Hong Kong style reintegration.<br>
			<br>
			Talking to officials in Beijing, they remind the visitor of the seriousness of their intent over Taiwan at every opportunity. They had welcomed the Clinton administration approach which made it clear that independence for Taiwan was not an option. They recognise that they currently do not have the military capability for an amphibious operation to reclaim Taiwan, but they certainly have a conventional (and nuclear) missile capability to threaten the island if it steps out of line too far. The threats made in the run up to the Taiwanese election were designed to influence the outcome. As is so often the case with such threats, the electorate voted for the candidate, Chen Shui-bian, who the mainland was trying to stop.<br>
			<br>
			China takes strong and rapid diplomatic retaliation against any state which appears to be prepared to recognise Taiwan as an independent entity. When Macedonia seemed to be according too much status to Taiwan, China retaliated by removing the UN authorisation for the stabilising force there. Only the US and France have been prepared to take the heat which comes from arms sales to Taiwan. The biggest worry that China has is that Taiwan will acquire a missile defence capability which would counteract the threat from the mainland. This was why the prospect of sales of Aegis cruisers, which have a limited anti-missile capability, was such a controversial item. The capture of the US EP-3 intelligence gathering aircraft added a further complication to the plot. There was much pressure on President Bush from the Right to show China that the US was prepared to take a hard line in support of Taiwan and arms sales.<br>
			<br>
			 In the event, the package did not include the Aegis cruisers. However, in a somewhat surreal development, it did include diesel powered submarines. This was odd on two counts. First the submarines stretched the definition of defensive systems to the limit. Second, the US no longer builds conventionally powered submarines. Like the UK, it fields an exclusively nuclear powered fleet. There is still no indication where these submarines are to come from. The Dutch and German builders are unlikely to get export authority from their governments. It is perhaps unfortunate that the four brand new Upholder class submarines, that the Royal Navy declared surplus to requirements in the mid 90's, are no longer available. They went for a song to Canada.<br>
			<br>
			If the arms sale package was more modest than it might have been, the declaration of support for Taiwan and its defence was much more explicit than Bush's predecessors had given. The President declared that the US would use whatever means were necessary to defend Taiwan from military attack. He modified these assurances slightly in subsequent statements, but the thrust remained unchanged. The concern in the State Department will be that this will encourage those Taiwanese who seek independence to be more outspoken, and thus raise the political temperature across the narrow straits between China and Taiwan.<br>
			<br>
			If China is worried by these developments, and also by the generally tougher line from the US on a range of other issues, it will also be fretting about the changes in government in Japan. The new Prime Minister, Junichiro Koizumi, has already said it is time to turn the Japanese self defence force into a proper army which can take part in international commitments. The Chinese continue to worry greatly about Japanese military developments.<br>
			<br>
			What does all this mean for the UK? Whitehall doubtless hopes that it can keep out of any trouble with China.. If conflict does break out it may be difficult to explain why we went to the defence of the Kosovan Albanians, but are not prepared to help the Taiwanese who have invested greatly in this country. Let us hope the choice of whether to act or not does not arise.       </p>
