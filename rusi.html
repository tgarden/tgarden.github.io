<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>The Defence Planning Process</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The slot that I have been given in the programme is perhaps at one
both the easiest and the most difficult. Having not yet heard from
the galaxy of expertise which will look at detailed aspects of
possible future combat air systems, I can make broad sweeping
generalisations which may or not reflect  the assumptions that each
of our speakers will be making. I can only give you a personal view
of the factors that are likely to shape our security needs in the
coming years, and the constraints and opportunities that may be in
play.  In any forward planning process, you need first to examine
what the aim of the exercise is before advocating solutions. In the
Cold War, we would start with a fairly detailed and specific threat
analysis. In the less well defined security context today, we develop
military capabilities which are shaped to give us certain scales of
forces (defined by size, radius of action, capability and
sustainability - for example the SDR requirement for a combat brigade
with naval and air support , deployable for a second crisis of which
only one involves warfighting and is no longer than 6 months). These
capabilities are proposed against a range of possible security needs,
but are also need to be structured to be sufficiently general purpose
to meet unforeseen problems.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>So, I shall talk a bit of future security needs. In a conference
which is focused on the equipment side, we shall also need to look at
what technology will be offering to meet these security needs, and as
part of that the industrial dimension. As any defence programmer
knows, long term military planning has a large political input as
well as a purely military assessment.  It was good to start this
conference with Lord Gilbert  and to remember that however good the
military case for a particular programme, it is rightly the final
view of the politician that counts. What resources are available in
the future for defence will be a political judgment; which alliances
and cooperative ventures  flourish and which  die will be political
decisions, and which wars we fight and which we ignore is again up to
the politicians. It is important to remember this. As an exercise for
the SDR, I went through the annual Defence White Papers of the
previous 17 years to see how successful they had been in terms of
their forecasts and plans coming to fruition. For entirely
understandable reasons, it is a pretty dismal picture. So we should
not assume that  our convictions today will be translated into
hardware tomorrow. We must however make the best assessment we can if
we are to meet the challenges ahead.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Security Needs</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Let me turn to our security needs. We are accumulating more
experience than we might have wanted in the field of post Cold War
security. For the UK we have seen military action in the Gulf War, in
Bosnia both for UN and NATO operations, in air exclusion operations
over Iraq, in Desert Fox and now in Kosovo. This mix of NATO, UN and
ad hoc coalition warfare seems to be representative of the various
ways that we may find our forces being engaged in combat. The
announcement last week that the UK is prepared to assign a rapid
deployment force of brigade strength for deployment by the UN makes
such operations even more likely to be regular features of UK
military requirements into the future. Lessons on the mix of
capabilities needed will continue to flow from each experience, and I
shall return to balance of investment questions. However, the general
point to make at this stage is that these operations call for the
full range of  air land and sea capability, and that high intensity
warfare structures are appropriate to these types of operations. The
demands of low casualty rates both for own forces and for civilian
populations put new demands on survivability, intelligence and
precision. The difficulties of running military operations with a
coalition of democracies makes quick resolution important if public
and political support is to be maintained. Decisive quick resolution
requires the ability to concentrate force.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>It would be wrong in any look at security needs to consider only
the experience of the last decade. NATO membership still focuses on
the need to protect its members from an external threat. While we are
safer now from such a threat than in the past,   the timescales for
the defence planning and procurement process are very long. The two
new  carriers that we will talk about are planned for introduction
into service in 2012. By that time Russia may be very different -
perhaps better or perhaps more threatening.  We still have no way of
knowing whether our optimistic assumptions about the future
intentions of China are right, and again we may be more or less
concerned in ten year's time. Nor can we know how our natural allies
will be faring whether in Europe or in North America. NATO may have
enlarged further without difficulty and our security concerns be
similar to those we worry about today. But it may not. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In the near term we should worry about Kashmir, Korea and
Kurdistan - 3 more "K"s to add to Kosovo. We have not yet stabilised
the Balkans or solved the problem of Iraq. Taiwan could still be
difficult, and North Korea remains completely unpredictable. The
experience of the last decade has at least reminded the governments
of democracies that there is a continuing need to invest in defence
capability.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Technology </H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>As choices have to be made about new systems, technology will be
shaping our thinking. This is nothing new: military requirements have
in the past driven technological innovation. The difference  now is
that technological innovation - more often in the civilian field - is
driving military requirements. This audience will be only too well
aware of the difficulties caused by the long defence procurement
timescales compared to the very short generational times of today's
technologies. We are it seems condemned to procure obsolete
equipment, or forever chase the latest development and never deploy
capability. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>As we listen to the siren voices of technological promise for new
combat systems, we will need to keep asking what risks there are
inherent in these promises. Will the technology deliver what it
promises, will it be affordable, will be flexible and will it
dovetail with our likely partners in military operations? The
politicians may be asking other questions: will a particular project
enhance national research, boost national industry, show European
cooperation, reduce likely casualties, make weapons appear less
inhumane, or perhaps importantly appear as exciting procurement news
today. If we couple these military wishes with the political needs,
and perhaps add in the research community with the industrial
pressures, there can be a common interest in promoting the more
exciting technologies at the expense of the more mundane incremental
enhancements that can be delivered earlier  at lower cost. In the US
the continuing attempts at providing the magic defence against
ballistic missiles, first started in the 1960s, boosted in the 1980's
by SDI, and now translated into NMD, is a good example of how to pour
billions down the drain for no increase in military capability. We
have our own rather smaller scale examples in the UK.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>None of this is meant to be Luddite about technology. Air Systems
have always been at the technological leading edge. There are however
difficult trade offs to be made between technologies. Cost,
flexibility and survivability raise a wide number of issues which we
shall discuss in this conference. There are different approaches to
be taken, but there are also problems of how to put together
coalition operations if the technological approach diverges too far
between partners.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>One other aspect of technology which must affect our thinking is
the advantage that global technologies give to possible adversaries.
Anyone can walk into Dixons and pick up a handheld GPS receiver for
around &#163;100. This can give a third world power with some old
Russian or Chinese surface to surface missiles a much enhanced
capability to threaten its neighbours. Personal Computers are now
operating at computing speeds which used to be available only through
carefully controlled supercomputers. Trading restrictions for such
machines are impossible to enforce. As we have seen it is even
possible to send the US's most sensitive nuclear data by e-mail to
China. Consumer technology is offering many new choices to
prospective state and non-state trouble makers, even at the
conventional and information warfare level. For WMD there are other
dangerous opportunities.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Industry</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The make up of the delegates to this conference show how important
the industrial considerations are in all this. I shall not rehearse
the well known problems of transatlantic competition and
co-operation, although I suspect we hall hear much about it. Rather I
would head up the difficult industrial questions to be addressed as
we look forward to future combat air systems. They are of course part
of the technological problems which I have just mentioned. Each
nations wants its own thriving research, development and defence
industrial base. The numbers of systems procured are small, although
the cost and potential profits remain large. Co-operation,
partnerships, collaboration and merging of defence industries allow a
larger customer base, shared costs (and shared profits) and ease
interoperability problems. Technological transfer can either be eased
or become a problem, and needs to be considered carefully. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I worry a bit about the political pressures for exclusively
European integration of defence industries. There would seem little
benefit to defence capability if we develop two camps on either side
of the Atlantic. Both from a technology sharing aspect and from a
market sharing aspect, there seems to be much to be said for looking
at more transatlantic cooperation. In the end, much of  industry will
make its choices on shareholder value issues, and governments will
adapt procurement policies in the light of resultant industrial
changes.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Resources</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Perhaps the most important factor in planning our future combat
systems is one which is not on the agenda for this conference - yet
it will be in everyone's mind as we discuss options. It is of course
resources - how much money will there be for defence in the future
and how much of that will be available for combat air systems?
Defence budgets have been declining worldwide over the past decade.
It may be that for internal political reasons the US will up its
budget temporarily, but I do not think we should read too much into
this. From a UK perspective, the decline has been pretty unremitting.
It may be that the experiences of Iraq, Bosnia and Kosovo will give
George Robertson sufficient clout to enhance the UK defence budget -
or at least stabilise it beyond the SDR 3 year promise. For the rest
of Europe the picture is not encouraging. All are looking at
restructuring their forces to a greater or lesser extend to meet the
new requirements for deployed operations, but they are also looking
for lower costs. Germany has the problem of conscription to handle,
plus the establishment of rapidly deployable forces and a likely
decrease in budget of perhaps 20%. The more European nations (perhaps
including the UK) see themselves as minor partners to the US in
operations, the less incentive there will be to stabilise their
defence budgets. I have argued elsewhere that we need a European
defence budget into which nations must place either capability or
money. Then virtue would be rewarded (perhaps the UK would even be
entitled to a rebate).</P>

<P>In reality the choices that we will discuss in this conference are
likely to become more difficult because of the resource question.
However good, and militarily necessary, a system may be, if the
budget cannot afford it, it will not happen. We saw the difficulties,
particularly for Germany, in completing the Eurofighter project. This
should be a lesson for the various high ticket items that are on the
menu for future combat air systems.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Alliances</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In deciding what capabilities we need for the UK, we must
increasingly make some assumptions about the partnership in which we
operate. We have, although the government would deny it, shaped our
forces on an assumption that for the difficult operations, the US
will be with us in force. The Gulf War and Kosovo have shown us that
air power is today an American capability. The Europeans can to a
greater or lesser extend add extra capability, but none of it is
essential (militarily rather than politically). If we use our
submarine launched cruise missiles, we must fire a significant
portion of our total holding to gain an adversary's attention. If the
key to the air campaign is offensive action, we provide 4% of the
bombs dropped. The UK has a good record of providing a small but
broad capability to support an multinational operation. But how do we
decide, when resources constrain, which capabilities are essential if
all are optional?</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Balance of Investment Questions</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The defence programmer is always asking balance of investment
questions. The Strategic Defence Review articulated the debate and
the solution in a more public way than usual. But as I indicated at
the beginning, no Defence White Paper in the last 17 years has been
proved right in its assumptions and forecasts. After Kosovo, there
will be perhaps greater sympathy towards the resource needs for
defence. Will that sympathy be translated into priority for future
combat air systems? The air power enthusiast will argue that we now
have two air campaigns (the Gulf and Kosovo), with the air operations
over Iraq, as proof positive that the future is all about air warfare
and coercion from the air; and that this means that resources must be
focused in this area. This will be true for the United States, where
air power offers great advantages  to the US in its reluctant world
policeman role. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In the UK, the analysis post Kosovo may be different.  The air
power contribution at 15% of total sorties flown was respectable but
not critical to the operation's success. Alliance cohesion was
demonstrated, the UK matched or bettered its European partners, and
was seen as a serious player in the air. There will be questions to
be asked about weapons to platforms and about offensive to defensive
ratios of investment. There will  be questions to be asked about
aircrew to aircraft ratios.  But it is not immediately obvious that
the total segment of the defence budget which goes to air systems in
their widest sense will get first call on any reslicing of the cake.
The big lesson of Kosovo is more likely to be in the limitations
imposed by our now having such a small army. If we continue to need
to provide for NI, continue in Bosnia, take on Kosovo and now have an
added UN commitment, it is difficult to see how the sums add up. 
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Whatever the outcome of the next balance of investment examination
in the MOD, it would be a heroic assumption that significant extra
resources will be available for future combat air systems, and it is
possible that they will be reduced to pay for a larger army. This
conference needs then to face up to the challenge of priorities
rather than just providing an over hopeful menu.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>A Possible Solution</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In looking at ways to square the circle, I would offer some final
words of hope. We have a problem that one member of the Alliance
provides so much of the air power and technology that the remainder
begin to lose hope militarily, industrially and from the
technological aspect with ever matching the unequal partner. If we
are not as a result to end up as the Continent that provides
political respectability in the air, and infantry on the ground, we
do need to look more positively as ways to pool European capabilities
for greater effect. As it happens such pooling is much much easier
for air systems than for either land or maritime systems. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>We can also focus our attention of the systems which offer the
advantages of flexibility with a good cost-effectiveness ratio. We
must be as aware of through life costs on a systems basis as we are
of platform capital costs. After all the B52's still had a major role
in both the Gulf and Kosovo air campaigns. Money and technology
focused on weapons rather than platforms paid dividends. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>As with all forward planning, there is no way of knowing if we
have the right answer. We must just try to minimise the chances of
being completely wrong. This conference should help that process.
</P>
