<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Professor Sir Joseph Rotblat was a young
nuclear physicist in Poland in 1938, when  news came that  nuclear
fission had been achieved by German scientists. He saw the
theoretical possibility of a nuclear  chain reaction, which could
generate explosive amounts of energy. He moved to England just before
the outbreak of World War 2 and, in 1943, was recruited to the team
of scientists working on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos in the
United States. He believed that their work on the atomic bomb was
necessary to prevent Hitler from developing and using such weapons on
the Allies. In March 1944, in one of those chance events that shape
people's futures, he was invited to dinner by his old friend
Professor James Chadwick. Another guest was General Leslie Groves,
the Project  director, who remarked over dinner that the real purpose
of the bomb was to subdue the Soviets. Later that year, once it
became clear that Germany had abandoned its development of nuclear
weapons, Rotblat decided that there was no reason for him to continue
working on the development of such weapons. He  devoted the rest of
his life to the promotion of peace, the elimination of nuclear
weapons and ending war. He was among the founder members of the
Pugwash Conference on Science and World Affairs in 1957.  He was,
with Pugwash, jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1995.</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	"Ending War" is a volume to celebrate
Rotblat's 90th birthday in November 1998. The contributors include
politicians, scientists, academics, lawyers and campaigners. With
some twenty different writers in a slim volume, the analysis is never
deep. It reads more like a set of exam notes on the views of the
famous men (and they are all men) of peace of the 20th Century. Oscar
Arias, former President of Costa Rica and another Nobel Peace
laureate, explains how his country has managed without an army for
half a century. He believes the time has now come for the rest of the
world to follow  their example and bid farewell to arms. Mikhail
Gorbachev, also a former President and Peace Prize recipient,
recounts his own part in making the world a safer place. He believes
that the world needs a new type of leadership and new initiatives if 
it is to continue on the path of disarmament and peace. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Despite the title of the book, most of the
writers seem more interested in schemes to  reduce or eliminate
nuclear weapons rather than the much more ambitious project of ending
war itself. This is an important distinction since it is by no means
obvious that the elimination of all nuclear weapons would reduce the
incidence of warfare. Conversely, the ending of war would render
nuclear and other armories irrelevant. This focus on nuclear matters
reflects both Rotblat's work over the years and the main work of the
Pugwash Conference. There is much discussion about the role that
scientists could have played in stopping the nuclear arms race of the
Cold War. Professor Freeman Dyson believes that it might have been
possible for physicists to prevent the building of nuclear weapons in
1939 by concerted action. Given that energy demands would have led to
research into nuclear power, his hope for keeping the nuclear genie
in the bottle seems forlorn. He believes that the lessons have been
learnt by today's biotechnologists who have discussed a code of
ethics for their work. Again the realist will wonder how much this
will restrain the development of biological warfare agents in
undemocratic states. Professor Francesco Calogero, Chairman of the
Pugwash Council, argues that a nuclear-weapon-free world is
achievable, and is necessary for the long term survival of
civilisation. He advocates a programme to make nuclear weapon
expertise gradually disappear. He would have a minimum age
requirement for security clearances for nuclear weapon work, which
would divert young scientists into different fields. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Robert McNamara was the US Defense
Secretary under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. As such he was at the
heart of strategic thinking and the doctrine of Mutual Assured
Destruction. In this volume he argues for a very different approach
by the United States now that it has lost its enemy. He reminds us
that there are still 40,000 nuclear warheads in the post Cold War
world. As someone in the centre of the Cuban missile crisis of 1962,
he argues that both sides made grave misjudgements then which could
easily have led to a nuclear exchange. Things are no better today,
and he believes that "there is a substantial and unacceptable risk
that the twenty-first century will witness a nuclear holocaust". To
prevent this the nuclear powers need to remove  their nuclear weapons
from alert status, and takes steps to return to a non-nuclear
world.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	John Polanyi, chemistry Nobel prizewinner,
looks at the role that the international organisations should play in
preventing war. He believes that the hallowed concept of national
interests must be extended to include a deeper concern for the
instruments of collective security such as the United Nations and
NATO. Although his piece was written before the Kosovo operation, 
his ideas are reinforced by experience there. Indeed the humanitarian
operations in both Kosovo and in East Timor should give some comfort
to the reader. It appears that the international community is
prepared to act decisively to protect human rights when it can. Many
advocates for total disarmament are having to come to terms with the
need for military force to stop such humanitarian tragedies. </FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	"Ending War" will have been a wonderful
birthday present for Joseph Rotblat. For the paying customer it gives
rather less value. Each contributor has too little space to argue his
case. Much has happened in the past year which needs to be addressed.
In the United States, the failure to ratify the Complete Test  Ban
Treaty and the push to amend the Anti Ballistic Missile Treaty give
little confidence in the hopes of the more optimistic contributors.
On the other hand, military operations in the Balkans and Indonesia 
have shown that preparation for war may still be necessary to prevent
worse evils.</FONT></P>
