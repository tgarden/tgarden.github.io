			<h4>Overstretch in the armed forces</h4>
			<address>Urgent motion at 2006 Lib Dem Conference</address>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The government claims that our forces are merely stretched but not overstretched. I prefer to believe the objective evidence published by the National Audit Office, who have said that the forces have now been operating beyond the planned level for over 7 years.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Of course our forces can from time to time surge to meet an emergency demand, but if they are always operating beyond their means, a number of bad things happen. Deployments become&nbsp; more frequent so time at home both to train and to be with their families shortens. Retention falls and shortages increase, particularly in the most needed specialisations. Experience levels reduce.</p>
			<p>The Armed Forces Pay Review Body this year identified key shortages in 20 areas of the RN, 25 in the Army and 40 in the RAF. Military medicine is now just about down to half the requirement.&nbsp; We should not forget the effect on Reserves either. They are used increasingly to fill the gaps, and they are voting with their feet.</p>
			<p>Tony Blair has used his armed forces with little thought for their long term viability. Iraq has multiplied the problems. But whether it is the Balkans, Iraq, Afghanistan, Sierra Leone, or East Timor, we have seen added commitments. Afghanistan is in difficulty in the South, and even if we send more troops, we have neither the helicopters &#150; or as importantly the pilots to fly them &#150; to support our hard pressed soldiers.</p>
			<p>Liberal Democrats are supporting our servicemen and women across a range of issues: conditions of service, better accommodation, the establishment of an ombudsman, sustainable levels of operations, and a more accountable Ministry of Defence.&nbsp; We had a great victory in the summer with at last getting the servicemen&rsquo;s voting arrangements sorted out against&nbsp; MOD opposition. We have the opportunity to do yet more in the Armed forces Bill.</p>
			<p>It is not just that the defence budget is incoherent, but that the loyal, dedicated and outstanding ability of our soldiers sailors and airmen is being thrown away without thought for the future.&nbsp; Our armed forces need real support, and we are the only party giving it.</p>
