			<h3><font size="-1">NATO: the end in sight?</font></h3>
			<address><font size="-1">By Tim Garden</font></address>

			<p><font size="-1">The Iraq crisis may have taken its first casualty before a shot is fired. NATO is looking damaged after an acrimonious internal division over preparations for a possible war. Much of the anglo-saxon media characterised the breaking of NATO's silence procedure by France, Belgium and Germany as outrageous. Was this not a case of those who had benefited from Alliance security for half a century, biting the hand of their most steadfast protector? Since NATO celebrated its 50th birthday in Washington in 1999, questions about its continuing role and relevance have grown ever louder. The current spat over Iraq reflects underlying tensions between members over new strategies to cope with new threats. The Cold War certainties have long since gone, and the future of the Alliance as a serious military player is now in doubt. This has profound implications for the future of European security.</font></p>
			<h4><font size="-1">Decline and Fall</font></h4>
			<p><font size="-1">How has the most successful military alliance come to this fragile state? Even as theWashington birthday summit was taking place, NATO in Kosovo was fighting its first &#150; and most probably last &#150; war. Despite the difficulties of achieving consensus among the newly enlarged 19 members, a successful air campaign was sustained. Yet America  was not impressed that it had to provide the vast majority of the firepower, and at the same time act under the constraints of a consensus organisation. Nor did the European members seem to be doing much to fulfil their grandiose promises to modernise and increase their military capabilities.<br>
					<br>
					When NATO declared that the 11 September 2001 attacks on New York and Washington were an attack on the whole alliance, the US were grateful for such immediate and strong political support. But for the Afghanistan campaign, they dealt with allies individually rather than through NATO so that they could remain in control of the operation. By the Prague summit last year, the transatlantic differences in strategic thinking were becoming yet more marked. Further NATO enlargement was nodded through. New ways of kick starting European defence capabilities were debated; but there was little expectation of rapid transformation. <br>
					<br>
					Now, as US and UK forces ready themselves for an apparently inevitable war in Iraq, NATO seems even more sidelined. The French and Germans worry that precautionary deployments to Turkey will be taken as a NATO endorsement of military action in Iraq. The US rages that &quot;old Europe&quot; is betraying the alliance. That the debate is conducted under the television lights scarcely helps achievement of consensus. Doubtless, when tempers cool, NATO will manage to recompose its image; but the damage is real and will be long lasting.</font></p>
			<h4><font size="-1">After NATO</font></h4>
			<p><font size="-1">It seems now that NATO's days at the centre of international security affairs are numbered. The organisation will probably continue to exist, unless the US decides to end it by withdrawing its participation. This seems unlikely, although significant withdrawals of US forces from Europe may now follow. NATO remains useful in reaching out to new members; and in providing some military standardisation for coalition operations. It should have a role in encouraging European members to develop more appropriate military capabilities; but the record here is less encouraging. Certainly, the US is not interested in using NATO for its serious military adventures. The only significant hardware that NATO owns is its airborne early warning AWACS   force. This was deployed to help protect American airspace in the immediate aftermath of the World Trade Center attack. Any other useful capabilities are owned by member nations, and the US is more comfortable negotiating one by one to use them as part of a US led coalition.<br>
					<br>
					For Europe, this change in the relevance of NATO  has had surprisingly little impact. It might be expected to have made the moves towards producing a real EU military capability more urgent. Yet the force proposals which stemmed from the Helsinki Headline Goals have made as little real progress as the much vaunted NATO Defence Capabilities Initiative. Defence budgets across Europe show little sign of real increases despite the worsening international security situation. The money that is spent is often wasted on propping up declining national defence industries. <br>
					<br>
					The divisions between EU members on policy for Iraq have been very serious. While the damage to NATO has been the focus of attention, the implications for the development of EU common foreign and security policy is even more significant. Without some hope of moving to the development of a mechanism for a European foreign policy, there is little hope for the much needed rationalisation of defence capabilities across the EU. The Helsinki goals have occupied the bureaucrats but have delivered no new capabilities or greater efficiency.<br>
					<br>
					At a time when the EU is looking at how it should change, the discussion on defence issues in the Convention give little hope than we shall see any real changes. What is needed is a strategic defence review on an EU wide basis. This raises deep political difficulties about national sovereignty. As a result the decline in military power in each EU state will continue, and the influence of Europe on US foreign policy will further reduce. If a common European security approach could be achieved, then serious military capabilities would flow from integration and pooling. These would make Europe more effective, might stem the decline of NATO, and would provide an option for life after NATO.</font></p>
			<h4><font size="-1">Transatlantic Bridge Collapses</font></h4>
			<p><font size="-1">These sorry developments perhaps affect one nation more than any other. The UK has cast itself  in the role of a bridge between the US and the mainland of Europe. As the divide widens, Britain finds this position more and more difficult. In the military sphere, the UK seems to have already decided that its future is with the US concept of power. The latest UK defence policy paper makes it clear that plugging into US transformational capabilities is the priority. Whether these are affordable is another question, but the British push to lead the new EU military capabilities is now history. UK defence capabilities continue to decline under the remorseless effect of budget constraints. Industrial featherbedding makes the problem worse, as has been seen by the recent bizarre decision on the contracts for the new aircraft carriers. <br>
					<br>
					The UK will find it difficult to take a lead in Europe when it is seen as a military dependency of the US. The likely lack of any movement towards monetary union will reinforce this irrelevance to the rest of Europe. The new US strategy calls for a much more proactive global intervention policy. This will be an expensive tiger for the UK to ride. With tiny armed forces spread between Northern Ireland, firefighting duties, domestic counter-terrorism duties, the Balkans, Afghanistan and Iraq, Britain is already &quot;punching above its weight&quot;. As time goes on we shall have ever more difficult choices to make about which capabilities can be afforded. By  linking future security so directly to the USA,  British sovereignty is likely to become yet more illusory. The door is closing on alternative future where Europe could have developed a serious integrated military capability to underpin a common foreign policy. And all of this is before a shot is fired in Iraq.</font></p>
