<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">This paper traces the development of air
power thinking from the earliest days of flight to modern times. It
argues that the prophets of air power were often flawed in their
predictions. Air power technology developed rapidly  and in
unpredictable directions.  Army and Navy leaders saw the new air
systems as little more than extensions of their surface capabilities,
and therefore lacked the imagination to develop new methods of
fighting. Experience in war forced some military commanders to
realise that control of the air was necessary for victory. Strategic
bombing was central to the thinking of professional airmen, but was
unable to offer certain victory until the development of atomic
weapons. Eventually, missiles became more useful as nuclear delivery
systems than manned aircraft. At the end of the 20th Century, air
power underwent a radical reappraisal after its successful
application in a number of limited war campaigns. Precision air
delivered weaponry offered politicians an easier option for
prosecuting wars.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Introduction </FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The history of warfare has been a
progressive search for technological advantage. Weapons have been
progressively developed for ever greater range. Both on land and at
sea, the advantage has gone to the side who could see furthest, and
then bring firepower to bear on the adversary. Armies would seek high
ground; navies would post lookouts at the top of their ships' masts.
Guns were given greater and greater range. The advent of flying
machines changed the nature of warfare for all time. In a period of
less than a century, military use of the air has moved from tethered
balloons to cruise missiles using satellite-based navigation systems.
The third dimension of warfare has encompassed space itself. The
novelty of the technology has given many problems for those who
attempted to develop air power thinking . Often they predicted
capabilities which were then beyond the science of the day. Centuries
of maritime and land fighting experience held back the development of
a new three-dimensional doctrine. The first advocates of the use of
air power had to fight difficult institutional battles to gain
sufficient resources. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In the early days, aircraft, both heavier
and lighter than air, were seen as no more than giving extra tactical
height to the military commander for his surface battle.  Yet the
ability to threaten deep behind the frontline was rapidly realised,
and governments feared that they would be unable to defend their
cities against bombs dropped from aircraft or airships. Limited
experience of such attacks in World War One was extrapolated by
theorists to claim that the bomber was the war winning capability of
the future. In the event, defensive measures, lack of bombing
accuracy and civilian resilience meant that World War Two had to be
fought by a more traditional and prolonged all arms campaign. It was
not until the last days of that war in 1945 that the use of an atomic
bomb changed the calculus of warfare. From the nuclear devastation of
Hiroshima onwards, it became possible to guarantee the total
destruction of cities from the air. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The period from the end of World War Two
until 1989 was dominated by the potential for a nuclear war between
the Soviet Union and the United States. Each, with its allies,
fielded increasing numbers of atomic weapons that in the early days
would be delivered by aircraft. In later years, missiles became the
preferred delivery system. This period of Cold War was prevented from
becoming a hot fighting war by the absolute assurance that nuclear
weapons delivered from above would leave no winner. Air power played
the key role in making  war between major powers unwinnable. </FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Since the end of the Cold War, nuclear
weapons have been less prominent in strategic thinking. Smaller more
traditional wars have become the focus of international interest. The
United Nations has from time to time been moved to right
international wrongs such as the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq in 1990.
A new approach to warfare has been developed through these
experiences in the last decade of the 20th Century. Air power has
become much more precise in its application using conventional
weaponry. This has allowed powers to exert force without risking
either large casualties to their own forces or to non-combatants in
the target zone. Air power has become the weapon of first choice: to
be used ahead of, and perhaps instead of, surface forces. After a
century, the world is looking at the use of military force in a new
way through the capabilities of air systems.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Man has dreamt of flying like the birds for
all of history. Yet, it was not until 1783 that the Montgolfier
brothers in France first overcame gravity in their hot air balloon.
By 1794, at the Battle of Fleurus, the French Generals were able to
direct the operation from their aerial headquarters. Tethered
balloons were developed over the next hundred years to provide useful
artillery spotting lookouts.  The major limitation of such balloons
was their lack of directional control. They had either to be captive
with a tethering line, or allowed to drift with the wind. The first
dirigible airship was flown by Henri Giffard in France in 1852.
Airships continued to be developed for both civil and military use as
the internal combustion engine gave a more effective power source. In
Germany, Count von Zeppelin made great advances, which were to
provide his country with a significant military airship capability.
Nevertheless, airships were to remain slow moving and vulnerable as
they had to displace large volumes of air to provide the lift for
their engines and payload. Speed would require the development of
heavier than air flying machines.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Controlled powered heavier-than-air  flight
was realised at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina on 17 December 1903 by the
Wright Brothers. Military interest was variable, but enthusiasts
ensured that airplane technological development was rapid. Louis
Bleriot flew across the English Channel in 1909 showing that England
was no longer safe as an island nation. In 1911, a Curtiss biplane
was successfully launched from and landed back on a warship. That
year was to see the first use of air power in war. Italy was at war
with Libya, and began using aircraft  and airships for aerial
reconnaissance. By the following year, hand held bombs were being
dropped on desert troops below. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT COLOR="#000000">Air Power in World War One</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The French followed these trends closely and
took the lead in developing air commands. At the outbreak of World
War One they had some 138 military aircraft, and had also been
building them for Russia. Germany had concentrated its early
development work on airships for military use, but it too was
building heavier-than-air machines, and had 232 by 1914. The United
States showed remarkably little interest in military aviation
developments, which was why the Wright brothers spent their time
selling their machines in Europe. The British reorganised their air
capabilities into an army specialist force, the Royal Flying Corps,
and subsequently added the Royal Navy Air Service in early 1914. In
July 1914, shortly after war was declared, the 37 airplanes of the
Royal Flying Corps flew across the Channel to France. The primary
role of these aircraft was reconnaissance, and they rapidly proved
their worth to the land commanders. In the first big battle of the
war at Mons, General Sir John French reported that the Royal Flying
Corps had provided crucial information on enemy movements. It was
however for artillery spotting that the new air capabilities were
most used in the early days of the war. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Inevitably, when German aircraft found
themselves near French or British aircraft, small arms fire was
exchanged. This led to each side developing armaments for their
aircraft. From 1915 onwards, the use of forward facing machine guns,
which fired through propeller blades, allowed fighter tactics to be
developed. Tactical formations of aircraft had their genesis in
cavalry manoeuvres, and air to air combat became an activity in its
own right. The importance of attempting to control the airspace above
them  was becoming obvious to commanders, and they needed to give
higher priority to this task if they were not to be vulnerable to
enemy air reconnaissance and artillery spotting. In many ways, the
development of air power progressed ever more rapidly in the maritime
environment. Reconnaissance developed into anti-submarine warfare.
Air defence fighters were needed to protect cargo ships from attack.
The British Navy developed its own bomber force to destroy the
Zeppelin threat by bombing their bases in Germany. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Although of relatively limited military
effectiveness, the most significant air power development of the war
was to be that of strategic bombing. Targets were both military and
civilian, and the greatest shock was to Britain, which, as an island
nation, had long felt secure from enemy attack.  As a consequence,
the Zeppelin and Gotha raids on London had a disproportionate effect
on future air power thinking. Some 9000 bombs were dropped by German
airships and aircraft on Britain during the whole of the war, killing
some 1413 people and wounding a further 3408. The British public
clamour was for air defence at home and retaliatory strikes on
Germany.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT COLOR="#000000">Air Forces need a separate
organisation</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The development of air power during World
War One was extraordinarily rapid, but was not particularly well
thought through. Army and Navy commanders had no experience of what
the new technology could offer. It was also expensive in terms of
cost of equipment and also in its need for trained manpower.
Arguments over funding priorities further hampered developments. This
was unacceptable to the British Government, who felt uniquely
threatened by this novel military capability. These organisational
problems led to the establishment of the first separate military arm
for air power, the Royal Air Force, in Britain in 1918. Winston
Churchill, who was the politician in charge of the Royal Navy, was
quick to understand the importance of an independent system for
managing air assets. He pushed forward the establishment of a new Air
Ministry to manage all aircraft equipment procurement.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In World War One, air power was used in
virtually all of its modern military roles, which were to be greatly
developed subsequently. There was no time for theorists to discuss
optimum strategies for incorporating this new capability into
traditional warfighting doctrines. The airmen of the time had a high
casualty rate, which meant there were few available to fight the
institutional battles. By the end of the war, of the 175,000 military
aircraft built by France, Germany and Britain, some 116,250 had been
destroyed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">With the end of the Great War, there was
little general interest in learning the air power lessons of the
conflict. The expectation that this had been a war to end war meant
that military spending was rapidly scaled down everywhere. In
Britain, there was debate as to whether the new Royal Air Force was
necessary in peacetime. Certainly, there was little sympathy for
spending money on this expensive part of the military establishment.
The RAF was reduced within 6 months of the Armistice from 188
operational squadrons to just 23, of which fewer than half could be
deployed.  Hugh Trenchard, who had served  with the Royal Flying
Corps, and had risen to be Chief of the Air Staff of the new RAF,
became the custodian of British air power thinking throughout the
1920's. He was a strong believer in offensive air power, and of the
importance of the bomber in any future wars. However, in the absence
of any planning for major wars, he was better able to promote the RAF
in the role of imperial policing. Britain had a large empire to
control, but was short of money to fund the necessary troops.
Trenchard was able to offer his  small and relatively inexpensive
force as a cost effective way to keep dissident rebels in check. In
Iraq in 1921, five RAF squadrons were used to replace a ground force
of 33 battalions. </FONT></P>

         <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">We are sure that if, after a
         prolonged spell of peace, war on a grand scale suddenly
         broke out again, the Power which had the most intensive
         study of aerial warfare would start with an enormous initial
         advantage, and the Power that neglected this form of active
         defence might well find itself fatally situated.</FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Proceeding on this assumption, we
         contend that the British policy is to develop the
         independent conception of the air as an art, an arm and a
         service; and this method alone will secure  that qualitative
         ascendancy and superiority which the safety of the country
         requires. We think that to keep this new arm, with its
         measureless possibilities, in perpetual thraldom to the army
         or navy, and confined solely to ancillary and auxiliary
         duties in relation to these two older services, will be to
         rob it of its most important developments.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In this period of peace, it was the ideas of
an Italian General, Giulo Douhet, which captured the imagination
strategic thinkers. His book, The Command of the Air, was published
in 1921 and translated into English two years later.  He declared
that in future wars whichever side could win in the air would achieve
victory. He argued that aircraft had extended the traditional
battlefield to include civilian populations, and that attacks should
be made on national institutions and infrastructure. The effect of
such bombing would undermine the population's will to fight as well
as disrupting its means to fight. To this advocacy of strategic
bombing, he also added the importance of attacking an enemy's air
power capability when it was on the ground and vulnerable. His ideas
were echoed widely by those who had been involved in the air
operations of World War One.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In the United States, General Billy Mitchell
was making himself well known with the public, but unpopular with his
military colleagues, for his strong advocacy of air power. In 1921,
he provided a practical demonstration of the sinking of a captured
warship by air attack, followed two years later by two more high
profile test attacks and sinkings. But it would be another 20 years,
before the United States discovered at Pearl Harbour that it was as
vulnerable as Billy Mitchell had predicted. He railed, as successive
airmen have, against the inefficiencies of air power being shared
between the Army and the Navy. He was court-martialed in 1925 (Douhet
had suffered a similar fate in 1916), but undoubtedly motivated the
US Navy towards the development of aircraft carriers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">If the victorious powers of World War One
were investing little in military air power, this was not true
elsewhere in the world. The defeated Germany was notionally
constrained in the development of military capability. However, the
importance of air power was recognised and was developed initially
secretly in co-operation with the Soviets. The Luftwaffe came in to
being in 1935 as an independent service with a different philosophy
from the strategic bombing doctrine of the Trenchard, Mitchell and
Douhet. The Luftwaffe was primarily trained and equipped to attack
enemy forces in the air and on the ground and at sea. It was designed
to concentrate firepower to disrupt and destroy the opponent's
military capability. The German doctrine of blitzkrieg required early
and massive air power to be brought to bear on the enemy's combat
forces. Japan developed its own military air capability, which was
used to great effect against China from 1931 onwards. In particular,
by 1937 they had a capability for long range bombing missions. They
developed a technique for forward refuelling airfields to extend the
range of their fighter aircraft. </FONT></P>

<H4><FONT COLOR="#000000">Civil Aviation and Minor Wars Drive
Progress</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">For the USA and the rest of Europe, the
advances in air power technology in the inter-war period were driven
more by the growing civil interest and enthusiasm for flying than by
the worries of air-minded strategists. Air races accelerated the
developments in engines and airframes. Altitude record breaking
attempts were just as important. In 1920, the USA had achieved 33,000
feet and in 1938, Italy held the record at 56,000 feet. Similar
progress was made in extending the range of aircraft: the French
achieved just under 2000 miles in 1925, while the British had broken
7000 miles by 1938. Everywhere was potentially within bombing range.
There were also real operations for nations to test their new
capabilities. The Japanese air operations against the Chinese
received little attention in Europe, but allowed the Japanese to
develop their air doctrine significantly before  World War Two. Of
greater significance was the Spanish Civil war from 1936 to 1939. As
well as the Spanish air force, Soviet, German and Italian air power
was in action. The Soviet force was some 1500 aircraft, but they were
inaccurate as bombers and also vulnerable to German fighters. The
German Luftwaffe exercised their doctrine of joint operations in
support of ground forces to great effect. They were also able to
bring in new tactics where necessary. Tactical battle formation
flying rapidly replaced tight display formations. Air power was
integrated into ground operations with the use of forward air
controllers. Concentration of strategic bombing for maximum effect
was tested. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">As war broke out in 1939, Germany was better
prepared with good aircraft and experienced crews who had developed
air power as a key part of their military doctrine. In Britain, the
late build up of capability, and the focus on bombers, had left the
air defences less than comprehensive. Nor was there much agreement
within the RAF, or beyond, on the most effective employment of these
scarce resources. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In the six years from 1939-1945, every
theory of air power was put to the test and modified, and all the
main roles of modern air warfare were exhaustively exercised. World
War Two was a new type of war in terms of communications, speed and
extent.  Air power had made every civilian potentially  vulnerable,
and had taken away the safety of dispersal and distance. Yet the
promises of technology were often found wanting, and each new
technological development was matched rapidly by a counter move.
Radar made air defence practical, but was soon degraded by
counter-measures.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In popular images of the war, the Battle of
Britain remains the most memorable of air campaigns. Britain had only
limited numbers of air defence fighters. In August 1940, the German
bombers and escorting fighters outnumbered the defenders by about 3
to 1. Following their philosophy of using air power to attack
military capability, the German bombers targeted ports, airfields and
British fighters. The RAF senior leadership was divided over the best
defensive tactics.  By the end of the month, Germany was targeting
the radar stations and command centres successfully. German offensive
counter-air operations were working, and the British air defence
system was being defeated.  On 7 September 1940, Germany, believing
it had won control of the air switched its bombers to strategic
targeting of London. This allowed the British air defence system to
rebuild and fight back. Future strategists have taken the lesson that
air superiority lasts only as long as enough air effort is devoted to
it. Unlike the permanent seizing of ground by advancing armies, the
battle for airspace control must be continued day after day.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">A less well publicised, but as important,
aspect of the air war was the Battle of the Atlantic. Britain was
dependent on supplies being delivered by convoys across the Atlantic.
German submarines were increasingly  successful in sinking these
ships. Allied air cover was able to reduce these losses considerably,
but it was difficult to obtain the priority for scarce air power
resources. The strategic bombing of Germany was believed to be a more
important task for long range assets.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The strategic bombing campaign encapsulates
many of the weaknesses of the strategic thinking of the inter-War
years. Proponents had overstated the psychological effect on
populations, and had also expected far more technical capability from
bombing systems than was achievable. The nature of the bombing
escalated as the war continued. The British began the war by dropping
leaflets and ended it by destroying cities. Again there were
differences of view between Commanders over which targets, military,
industrial or civilian were likely to be more productive in winning
the war. The poor bombing accuracy compounded the difficulties.
Arthur Harris, the Commander-in-Chief of Bomber Command, was an
ardent proponent of the area bombing campaign, but found himself
increasingly in dispute with the RAF leadership who sought more
precision attacks against what they assessed as key targets.</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">On the other side of the world, the Japanese
showed that it was possible to use air power to provide tactical
surprise. The attack on the US fleet at Pearl Harbour in 1941, and
the subsequent Japanese victories in the Philippines and Singapore
showed how well they had developed their offensive air power
capability. In strategic terms, the results were less helpful: the
United States entered the war and ultimately defeated the Japanese.
The industrial might of the USA was able to outproduce Japan and
Germany. By 1945 the US could field 18,000 aircraft against fewer
than 5000 Japanese.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">All the combatants were learning that
control of airspace was vital to survival, but that air power did not
provide the magic path to quick victory. It was at its most effective
when operating closely with the appropriate surface forces. Air power
could provide extended reconnaissance, defend against enemy air
attack, disrupt enemy supply lines, halt an enemy advance, and take
out a difficult target. The concentration of firepower in time and
space that was possible could be very effective in turning a ground
battle. However, aircraft could not hold territory or maintain the
continuous presence of armies. Nor could they transport the weight
and volume of cargo of surface ships. Combat air power was expensive,
always scarce but always needed. The setting of both strategic and
tactical priorities for air assets was the most important aspect, and
it took time to learn through mistakes. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">While military thinkers are more vocal in
peacetime, it is clear that there were some whose ideas were key to
air power utilisation in World War Two. Winston Churchill perhaps
gets too little credit for his lifetime appreciation of what air
power means to warfare. It was he that had been at the centre of
British air power developments in the previous war. He had warned of
the implications of German air power for British security in the
1930's. As Prime Minister he was able to determine both strategic
priorities and the aircraft production to support those tasks. In
Germany, Hermann G&ouml;ring had been a famous operational air
commander in the First World War, and rose to be the first and only
Marshal of the Reich under Hitler. While this helped the Luftwaffe
greatly with resources, G&ouml;ring lacked the vision of Churchill,
and the Luftwaffe remained tactical rather than strategic. The
Soviets  had taken air power seriously from the early days of the
revolution. However, the Soviet Air Force suffered greatly from the
loss of experience when Stalin purged the Red Army Command in 1937.
It was further undermined by the priority that Hitler gave to its
destruction in 1941. Stalin drew the lessons for the post war
importance of strategic air power. In Japan, Admiral Isoruku Yamamoto
had progressed from chief of navy aviation to become
Commander-in-Chief. He had been instrumental in the design of the
Japanese aircraft carrier fleet, and was the driving force behind
Japan's approach to maritime air power in the Pacific.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">World War Two marked the birth of the USA as
the air power nation. It had been surprisingly indifferent to pre-War
air power enthusiasts, and had contributed little in the development
of strategic thinking. Billy Mitchell's failed attempts to obtain a
separate air force had left air doctrine as no more than a part of
either army or navy force development. Nevertheless, in a later
parallel to Trenchard's career, General Hap Arnold rose through the
US army ranks to become the father of the US Air Force. He was a
follower of Douhet and the key air power adviser to President
Roosevelt. Winning the war in the air  required enormous and
sustained industrial production capacity, a pool of well educated
recruits as airmen and a strong research base to develop new
technologies. The USA was ideally placed geographically, economically
and culturally to meet these criteria. It has maintained its
pre-eminence ever since.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In the closing days of the war, the Douhet
theorists were given a new lease of life as the US dropped two atomic
bombs on Japan. The nuclear age was born and air power now appeared
the ultimate guarantor of victory.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">If the atomic bomb was to dominate strategic
thinking for the next half century, the jet engine and the missile
were also set to transform the mechanics of air power. All three
technological developments had been deployed in the latter days of
World War Two, but there was limited experience on which to
extrapolate the potential consequences for air power. Despite the
whole range of air power tasks having contributed to the war effort,
the post-war focus for the victorious powers was on development of
nuclear weapon delivery capabilities. Yet very rapidly, a non combat
form of air power was to prove critical in the growing confrontation
between the Soviet Union and the West. Berlin, blockaded by the
Soviets in 1948, was sustained by a unique allied air transport
re-supply operation throughout . </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Korean War (1950-1953) was a reminder
that conventional wars with limited aims remained possible in the
nuclear age. Jet aircraft were available in numbers for the first
time, but had to operate in a confined airspace. A limited war meant
political constraints on targets, and as a result strategic bombing
of China was ruled out. The lessons of joint operations were
re-learned, and for the United States there was a large expansion in
their recently (1947) independent air force. Again, the value of
flexible air support to troops on the ground  was demonstrated in
what was a very difficult ground campaign. The helicopter was
beginning to be used as a useful improvement to mobility in the
difficult terrain found in a series of such limited wars. The British
undertook operations in Malaya and the French in Indochina. The
Israelis were developing a serious air force to defend their newly
independent country. However all three nations were reminded of their
limitations in the Suez operation of 1956.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Yet for the United States, the Soviet Union
and the United Kingdom the key air power role was that of the nuclear
bomber. Resources were poured into aircraft and weapon development
and production. Conventional weapons were of secondary importance in
the battle for funding, despite the growing experience of the need
for limited war capability. In the US, General Hap Arnold wrote a
memo in 1945 arguing that in future the only defence possible was to
field an overwhelming strategic offensive force as a deterrent to any
aggressor. He outlined many of the detailed arrangements that were to
shape strategic nuclear forces throughout the Cold War. Academic and
political thinking about deterrence was also developing in parallel,
and is covered in the next Chapter. On the military side, General
Curtis Le May, who commanded the USAF  Strategic Air Command from
1948 to 1957, built a vast strategic bomber force which far exceeded
the capability of any other nation. He shaped the detailed
arrangements which ensured that the theoretical constructs of nuclear
deterrence could work in practice. The Soviets and the British also
progressed in the 1950s, followed in turn by the French and Chinese, 
with developing long range nuclear bombers. and providing the air
defences to protect them from pre-emptive destruction.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Deterrence theorists, such as Thomas
Schelling, explored arcane game theory in deriving the required force
structure. The RAND Corporation in the USA was greatly influential in
the development of Cold War air power thinking. The logic that 
deterrence depended on the nation being able to ride out  a first
nuclear attack, and yet still launch a devastating retaliatory
nuclear attack became widely accepted. This led to a requirement for
large nuclear forces widely dispersed, and a comprehensive national
air defence system. Yet even as the bomber forces were being build,
another technology was offering more assurance of a second strike
capability. Offensive missiles, both air-breathing and rocket
powered, had been used by Germany against Britain in the 1940s. In
1959, Bernard Brodie argued in a RAND study, that inter-continental
ballistic missiles could provide greater assurance of nuclear
retaliation than manned aircraft; but that a mixture of systems was
even better. In the United States, Robert McNamara brought to the
post of Secretary of Defense in 1961 a keen analytical mind. He
started the trend for thinking in capability terms when making
investment decisions. The nuclear powers have in the years since
moved from reliance on manned bombers for nuclear delivery towards
greater use of missiles based in silos on land and in submarines at
sea. Indeed, the United Kingdom by 1998 had abandoned all its other
nuclear delivery systems. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">As the Cold War deepened, the focus of air
power thinking, in the five declared nuclear powers, continued to be
centred on strategic nuclear weapon delivery. In 1957, the United
States was beaten  by the USSR in the race to place a satellite into
orbit around the earth. In 1962, the USA reacted strongly over the
deployment of Soviet nuclear capable missiles to Cuba. The building
and maintenance of a credible deterrent capability exercised both the
USA and the USSR throughout the 1960s. It can be argued that more
thinking about the lessons of air power in limited wars would have
helped the Americans in Vietnam and the Russians in Afghanistan. The
Vietnam war (1964-75) was a savage reminder of the limitations of air
power in fighting a guerrilla campaign. It was, however, a period of
intense development in conventional air warfare tactics and
technologies. Airmobility with helicopter gunship support brought a
new level of integration between ground and air forces. While the
massive scale of US air power could achieve tactical victories, the
strategic victory was more difficult. Escalation of conventional
strategic bombing was seen as the way to bring North Vietnam to the
negotiating table. Yet again, air power theorists were taught the
lesson that conventional bombing does little to make your enemy more
amenable. The series of bombing campaigns from 1964 to 1968 added up
to 300,000 missions and 643,000 tons of bombs dropped on North
Vietnam. The North Vietnamese continued to fight. By the end of the
Vietnam war, technological developments allowed much more precise
attacks with much lower vulnerability for the bombers. Nevertheless,
in the end the US withdrew its forces from Vietnam. Air power
theorists continued to argue that the defeat was because of the
political constraints rather than military inadequacy. However, Korea
had already shown the need for operational plans in limited war to
take into account the political reality.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">If Vietnam and Afghanistan reminded the two
superpowers of the limitations of air power in long campaigns lasting
years, Israel showed the world the importance of air supremacy in
much shorter wars. It had given priority to developing a modern air
force which was rightly feared by its Arab neighbours. The Yom Kippur
war of 1973 lasted only 18 days but provided a wealth of air warfare
data of the effectiveness of modern air weapon systems in a classic
set piece battle for national survival. The British and Argentineans
also learned the strengths and weaknesses of their air power
capabilities during the Falklands conflict of 1982. It was a
remarkable achievement for the UK, with its very small aircraft
carrier force, to wage a successful war at a range of some 8000 miles
from home. Subsequently, maritime air power advocates have used this
conflict as a strong argument for the continuing importance of
carrier-borne air power. Yet the costs remain high and the examples
of utility often ambiguous.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">While the sporadic examples of real fighting
during the Cold War provided justification to air power enthusiasts
for a whole range of capabilities, it continued to be the potential
NATO/Warsaw Pact confrontation in Europe which determined force
structures and technologies. The relatively simple deterrence policy
of massive retaliation grew into NATO's adoption of the more complex
"Flexible Response", in which the credibility of ultimate nuclear use
was enhanced by options to fight a conventional or tactical nuclear
war. This allowed operational planners to build up complex scenarios
which justified procurement of advanced air weapons systems, which
would also be useful in other conventional wars. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">By the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, air
and space military systems had developed beyond the imagination of
the early flying pioneers. Satellites could provide imagery of
anywhere on Earth, could allow worldwide communications and give a
three dimensional accurate location to any military unit. Missiles
could threaten virtually instantaneous destruction over the whole of
the globe. Bombers could make precision attacks with an assurance of
no error. Fighters could shoot down the enemy without ever seeing
him. Air-to-air refuelling had extended the range of missions across
the oceans. Ground attack aircraft and helicopters had become easier
to direct than artillery. Defensive and offensive counter-measures
reflected the exciting technological growth of domestic economies.
Yet with the end of the Cold War, the theoretical edifice of air
power was now much more questionable. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">NATO nations raced to reduce their military
spending as the threat from the Soviet Union disappeared. There was
little agreement on the necessary level that would be needed in the
future. Indeed, there were predictions that, without the common
threat of the Warsaw Pact, defence would revert to minimum national
needs. However in August 1990, before most governments had completed
their post Cold War defence reappraisals, Iraq invaded Kuwait. This
was a clear breach of international law and was also in an area of
considerable economic interest to the major powers. The United
Nations imposed economic sanctions, intense diplomacy was undertaken,
and this was underpinned by the build up of a US-led military
coalition of 29 countries in the theatre. Following failure of
diplomatic solutions to the crisis, an air campaign (Operation Desert
Storm) was launched against Iraqi forces on 17 January 1991. Although
massive ground forces had been assembled nearby in Saudi Arabia, the
force commander, General Norman Schwarzkopf, continued a purely air
offensive operation for 6 weeks. Precision weapons were used
extensively against infrastructure targets. Attacks were orchestrated
with appropriate air defence systems, refuelling tanker aircraft and
a mix of offensive capabilities. Cruise missiles, with terrain
mapping navigation, were used in quantity. Massive area bombing was
used against armour in the desert. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">On the 24 February, Schwarzkopf assessed the
Iraq forces as sufficiently degraded to launch the ground campaign.
It was still assumed that there would be a difficult fight to free
Kuwait. In the event, the Iraqi forces were routed and Kuwait freed
in under 4 days. Air power advocates had found a new role. They
claimed that modern precision air systems in overwhelming numbers
would in future win wars, leaving ground forces the easier task of
moving in afterwards to secure territory. However, even in the Gulf,
it was a limited victory. Air operations of various kinds continued
against Iraq for the rest of the decade. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">While the scale of the coalition for the
Gulf War was impressive, it was clear to all that the success
depended on American technology, numbers, doctrine and leadership.
The USA had emerged from the Cold War as a military power unmatched
by any other nation. It was investing much more in defence research
and particularly in aerospace and information systems. It appeared
that US air power would be the dominant factor in military thinking.
However, the very public success in achieving war aims with few
casualties in the Gulf had implications for future operations. US
forces were withdrawn from Somalia when 18 of their troops were
killed. In the worsening Balkan crisis, the US preferred air strikes
to promote agreement in Bosnia rather than contributing troops on the
ground. </FONT></P>

         hundreds of aircraft from many nations to be co-ordinated in
         time and space to achieve the mission. Typically AWACs
         aircraft will act as the aerial command post keeping a watch
         for hostile threats in the air. The airfields and aircraft
         carriers from where the missions are launched will all
         require their own air defence screens of missiles, guns and
         air defence fighters. The targets for the attack will have
         been identified by reconnaissance satellites, aircraft and
         drones.  Attacking aircraft will carry their own self
         defence systems, but will rely heavily on electronic warfare
         support aircraft, defence suppression missions using
         anti-radiation missiles, and combat air patrol fighters. The
         bombers identify their targets with television, radar or
         infra red sensors, or will be assisted by laser designation
         teams on the ground or in the air. The weapons will be
         guided  to the target by laser, television or satellite
         positioning systems. To extend the range of attack missions
         and to keep fighters on patrol, large numbers of air-to-air
         refuelling tankers will circle in nearby friendly airspace.
         Helicopters will be on standby to rescue any downed aircrew.
         Once an attack is completed, the reconnaissance force will
         be retasked to make an assessment of the damage caused and
         whether the target needs to be attacked again. Naval forces
         may provide carrier-borne air power and submarine launched
         cruise missiles. The army may be operating air defence
         missiles, attack helicopters or controlling incoming bombers
         with laser designation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The 1990s saw a series of operations, mainly
under UN auspices, to try to restore order in failing states around
the world. Air power had few answers to mass killings in civil wars
in Africa. Where agreements were achieved, such as in Bosnia, the
peace could only be maintained by the long term presence of
international ground forces. Yet the decade was to finish with a war
that was even more important to the air power dominance school of
thought. Having come to an uneasy settlement over ethnic divisions in
Bosnia, the focus moved to Kosovo. Serbia was increasing its
repression of the ethnic Albanian community in this province; the UN
and OSCE tried unsuccessfully to negotiate an acceptable peace
agreement. For the first time NATO nations agreed, without a formal
UN resolution, to use military means to solve a growing humanitarian
crisis within a sovereign state's boundaries. The instrument of
choice was explicitly solely air power. NATO leaders, when they
launched an air offensive on 24 March 1999 against Serbian forces,
ruled out an offensive ground campaign. Air power was being used to
bring the Serbian leadership back to the negotiating table. Over
23,000 bombs were dropped in the ten weeks of operations. From the
38,000 NATO missions flown, there was not a single casualty to the
alliance forces. On the other hand, a combination of political
constraints on targets, limited poor weather capability and good
Serbian defensive measures meant that the military effectiveness of
this prolonged air operation was limited. Nevertheless a peace
settlement was made in the June, before ground operations became
necessary. Again a large international force was needed to police the
settlement in Kosovo. Shortly afterwards, Russia followed NATO's
example of the use of air power in its rather less surgical approach
to quelling rebellion in Chechnya.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">While air power studies have concentrated on
the offensive operations in the Gulf and the Balkans, a growing need
for humanitarian intervention worldwide has had other implications.
Rapid response to sudden crises requires deployable forces. Nations
are restructuring their military capabilities to provide such forces
more easily. Strategic airlift and helicopter lift have in a much
quieter way contributed greatly to international responses to crises
in Africa and Asia. Planners in defence ministries around the world
finished the decade with a much clearer view of the need for the full
range of air power capabilities than they had had in 1990.</FONT>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Conclusion </FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The twentieth century was one of
extraordinary progress in the application of air power. Most air
power forecasters failed to make the right projections. This was
scarcely surprising as the technologies advanced rapidly, the
tactical implications were poorly understood and the strategic
context changed. Air power enthusiasts often overstated the
capabilities of their systems, and found it difficult to make their
case for resources in opposition to their land and maritime
colleagues. Successful air power nations needed a good technological
and industrial base, as well as institutional understanding of what
air power could offer. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The surges in practical military utilisation
of air power took place in fighting wars of the 20th century.
Theorising was extensive in the periods of peace, but was often based
on unjustified extrapolation of available data. Airmen were attached
to the thinking of Douhet, who saw the control of the air and the
bomber as the ultimate weapon system. Yet for much of the century,
support of ground forces was the more effective task for air
systems.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Currently, the United States has an
overwhelming military capability which is, to a large extent, based
on its modern air power forces. It can carry out precision offensive
operations  on a world-wide basis from its home territory. It can
deliver conventional or nuclear weapons from aircraft or from
submarines. It also has the most advanced space and information
capabilities, and it outspends all other nations on military
research, procurement and deployment. Given this focus of air power,
it will be inevitably be a prime influence for all other nations,
when looking at their own forces. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Analysts argue whether the air campaign for
Kosovo has set a precedent which will mean many more such
humanitarian interventions. Some believe the political difficulties
of maintaining NATO cohesion mean that it will not be repeated, and
that only UN authorised operations will be possible. These are more
likely to be at the lower intensity end of the spectrum and thus be
less dependent on combat air power. There are still however areas
where serious conflict is possible. The division of the Korean
peninsular remains. India and Pakistan remain fiercely
confrontational over Kashmir, and are both nuclear capable. China has
the potential to cause difficulty, particularly over Taiwan. Russia
is not yet a stable market economy. Ethnic problems erupt without
warning, and sometimes with great ferocity. In any of the possible
scenarios, air power is almost certain to have a part to play.
However, the costs of air systems remain a problem for all
governments including the United States. There are signs that
regional co-operation at providing air capabilities may be the
pattern of the future. NATO nations clubbed together to procure an
expensive airborne early warning system in the past. European nations
are looking at how they might provide such capabilities as
intelligence satellites and strategic airlift on a co-operative
basis.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Air power has become an increasing
attractive option for western nations, which wish to minimise the
risk of casualties to their own forces. This will increase the
pressure for the developing air systems and tactics which keep the
operator out of harm's way. Unmanned air vehicles will provide some
solutions as will greater stand off range for weapon systems.
However, the increasing concern about unintended collateral damage
will ensure that the man or woman is kept firmly in the
decision-making loop.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Military air power began as a form of
support for armies and navies. It grew to have strategic influence on
its own. Many of the problems of development have come from the
division of labour between armies, navies and, latterly, air forces.
Recognising this, the most recent moves have been towards joint
military organisations, which are designed to makes most efficient
use of all resources. This comes just at the time when doctrine seems
to be moving more towards the independent use of air power for
serious operations.</FONT></P>
