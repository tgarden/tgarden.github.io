<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The question of
what we can afford in military capability should shape all our thinking. It is
too easy to<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>make grandiose
statements about our responsibilities for promoting peace and security across
the world's stage. Of course, the vision ñ or what we used to call foreign
policy ñ is important, and should help to define the kind of capabilities to
which we aspire. But the constraints are always in the end those of resources.
Our conference is discussing Europe and America, and we look for their common
interests and worry about differences in approach. It is usually claimed that
the big divide across the Atlantic is caused by the different scale of the
defence budgets. This is only partially true. While the US and the EU have
broadly similar GDPs, the US is now spending nearly twice the number of dollars
(helped by the Euro/Dollar rate) on military aspects of security as do the 15
nations of the EU combined. On the other hand, the EU spends three times the US
budget on the development aid which also contributes to international peace and
security.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The real problem
in Europe is not the amount that we allocate to military spending, but the way
in which we spend it. This is also to an extent true of the USA, and I will
return to that in a moment. Europe (and throughout this I shall mean the EU
when I say Europe), spends around Ä150 bn a year on defence which is enough to
have nearly 2 million soldiers in uniform and over 3000 combat aircraft. Yet
when it comes to sorting out a relatively small problem in its backyard ñ The
Balkans ñ it finds itself able to do little but act in a supporting role to the
US, when military action is called for. European governments have recognised
this by agreeing the Defence Capabilities Initiative in NATO in April 1999, and
subsequently the Helsinki Headline Goals for an EU flexible military capability.
After 3 years the DCI has achieved little, and the HHG process has done little
more than temporarily arrest the continuing decline in national defence
budgets. Funding the key enabling capabilities still remains unsolved. There is
no mystery about the restructuring of military capabilities that is needed
throughout Europe, but national, institutional, political and industrial vested
interests make progress towards more useful and cost effective military
capability painfully slow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All militaries
suffer from the public sector problem. Industrial wages rise faster than
domestic inflation, reflecting increases in productivity and national wealth.
Military pay must keep up if people are to be recruited and retained, but for
many military activities numbers of people are not amenable to reductions
through increase in productivity. Indeed for the new tasks, which armies find
themselves doing, there may be a need for increasing numbers of troops on the
ground. So the pay bill rises faster than inflation. The equipment side also
suffers from a different rate of inflation. The calculations are complex, as
new weapon systems can show productivity increases (precision weapons reduce
sortie requirements), and defence programmers can adjust their replacement
timings to match affordability. All that said, the audience here will know that
the rising unit cost of the small runs of modern weapon systems is a key
concern. National industrial interests compound the problem by making
production runs even smaller, and also generating interoperability problems.
All of this means that around 80% of the defence budget is subject to cost
rises year on year which are greater than domestic inflation. European
governments think they have done well if they hold their defence budgets level
in real terms, and so year on year the capability declines; and the share of
GDP given to defence reflects this comparative decline. In the Cold War, at
times when the UK was in economic trouble, it felt able to spend over 5% of GDP
on Defence. Today, when we are rich, wanting to do good around the world and
arguably newly vulnerable, we are prepared to pay less than half that
proportion of our national income. The story is the same throughout Europe.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But as I said,
it is not just how little we spend, it is also how badly we spend it. 15
nations duplicating all their defence activities. If we were a multinational
business, which in a sense we are, we would long ago have rationalised our
supply chains, our training, our product delivery systems, and done away with
the bureaucracy of the headquarters in every country. This is politically very
difficult for member states. Michael Alexander and I wrote an article (The
arithmetic of defence policy) in last July's International Affairs, which
concluded:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If the
nation states of Europe wish to retain something approaching their current
ability to use military force in defence of their interests over the next 15 to
20 years, they will have to be prepared to integrate their respective efforts
to an ever more substantial degree.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The pursuit on a national basis of sophisticated and balanced
capabilities, suitable for both high intensity and peacekeeping operations, is
a chimera. In the case of the UK we will hit the wall well before the first new
aircraft carrier is due to arrive in 2012. In the case of most of our European
partners, the crunch will come much sooner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0cm'><span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman";font-style:normal'>This analysis was before the added
security needs of 11 September were apparent. While I hold out little hope for
fast progress in the rationalisation of EU defence, I still believe that some
things can be done to start the process, and to begin to convince finance
ministries that this is the only way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0cm'><span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman";font-style:normal'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0cm'><span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman";font-style:normal'>Let me now turn to the USA. It is often
assumed that the resources for defence are so enormous, the research investment
so great, and the technology so far ahead of all other nations, that the US has
no problems. Of course this is far from true. While the US does not suffer from
the fractured duplication of EU states, it has all of the other problems. Its
defence spending has also more than<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>halved as a proportion of GDP. It averaged 8% over the past 60 years and
will be 2.9% this year. The GAO quantified the shortfall at $50bn a year just
to sustain the current capabilities. The equipment costs using cutting edge
technologies rise rapidly, and the luxury of many different aircraft doing
similar jobs is disappearing. Industrial and other interests are subject to
pork barrel politics, and may mean less than optimum procurement or basing. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0cm'><span style='font-family:

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0cm'><span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman";font-style:normal'>The QDR report, published at the end of
September, identifies problems with readiness, retention of people, poor
training facilities, sustained underfunding of infrastructure maintenance, and
a lack of investment in new equipment, which is described as living off the fat
of the 80's. These problems will be well known in the UK and other European
defence establishments. The QDR does not detail the force structures that will
be developed in any but the most general terms. Countering CBRNE threats is a
recurring theme. For those unfamiliar with this acronym it stands for </span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-ansi-language:EN-US;
font-style:normal'>chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and enhanced
high explosive weapons. Developments in space capabilities including control of
space aspects are trailed. Intelligence is seen as a key enabler.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To the European reader, the vision of
global reach supported by extraordinary technologies and massive firepower
makes the practicality<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>of future
alliance operations seem unlikely. While the QDR constantly refers to helping
allies and friends, it gives no clue as to how the widening gap in capabilities
between the US and the rest of the world will be bridged. But these plans may
take far longer to come into being than anyone predicts. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-US

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-ansi-language:EN-US;font-style:normal'>On
10 January. President Bush signed the Defense funding bill for 2002. It was for
a rise of $30 bn over the previous year. Just over half of that increase goes
on missile defence and personnel retention, which leaves nothing like enough to
cover the shortfalls that were identified a year before. As public finance
becomes ever more difficult in the USA, we may find that the timescales for
these grandiose plans begins to lengthen. As the New York Times pointed out in
the middle of this month, Mr Rumsfeld has largely bowed to the momentum of
familiar weapons programmes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-ansi-language:EN-US;font-style:normal'>What
does affordability mean to the question of a European and American strategic
partnership. The US will have problems with moving as fast as it would wish.
But it starts from a much better position, and is investing far more in
military research and development than Europe. Most EU forces are irrelevant to
US needs on the types of operations that America wishes to undertake. The
Europeans will fall further and faster behind unless they both increase
spending and rationalise between themselves. As neither of these are likely to
happen, the tasking will fall quite naturally into a division of labour between
the US and Europe. The US will look after long range high intensity power
projection, and Europe will look after the post conflict rebuilding military
activities. This will not be because a strategic choice has been made:
affordability will determine this. The implications for NATO and transatlantic
relations may be profound</span><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman";
