<P>Israel's Nuclear Dilemma</P>

<P>Now that the Cold War has ended, nuclear strategists are finding
life hard. Gone are the academic certainties of mutual assured
destruction and credible second strike capabilities. Deterrence
theorists can no longer expound endlessly on the rationality of the
actors in a post-Chernobyl world, where Russian and American economic
strategy is more interesting than their nuclear thinking.
Nevertheless, proliferation of weapons, and in particular weapons of
mass destruction, is a world-wide concern. Yet even in this arena,
the spread of this awesome power has been both slower and more
limited than the prophets of doom have forecast.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The overt nuclear powers remain the five permanent members of the
UN Security Council. They have each demonstrated a nuclear
capability: USA in 1945, Russia in 1949, Britain in 1952, France in
1958 and China in 1964. In the 30 years since the first Chinese test,
only one other country has shown the world that it can successfully
cause an atomic explosion: India with its "Peaceful Nuclear
Explosion" of 1974. Of the number of other states which are credited
with a possible covert nuclear weapon capability, only Israel is
universally assumed to have a stockpile, the means of delivery, and a
credible national nuclear strategy; and all this without a public
acknowledgement of their nuclear status. Deterrence theorists can
thrill again to the arcane calculus of game theory in the regional
security structure of the Middle East.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Yair Evron is Professor of International Relations at Tel Aviv
University, and has examined the nuclear politics of the region in
detail. Given the secrecy which surrounds all nuclear matters in
Israel, his research is based on the open international literature
sources. This could of course mean that speculation is merely being
given respectability by being recirculated as fact. Those familiar
with the field are unlikely to come to such a verdict. Rather,
Professor Evron has carefully assembled a mass of commentary into a
coherent and logical story. He makes it clear that he has no personal
knowledge, and somewhat surprisingly he mentions the Vanunu story
almost obliquely, and leaves the reader to follow up his references
to it. Given that he uses the Vanunu revelations as a key event, it
would have been helpful to have had them summarised with a
commentary.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The book begins with a historical analysis of the development of
an Israeli nuclear capability (assessed as perhaps around 100
warheads). The reactions of the Arab states are also considered. The
difficulty that they have had in procuring their own nuclear weapons
is a useful reminder of the efficacy of the counter-proliferation
measures which the world community has applied. Despite active
pursuit of the nuclear goal, none of Israel's potential enemies
managed to achieve a capability. The author offers the thought that
there are two options for the future. International efforts to limit
proliferation could be expanded to slow progress yet more. On the
other hand a relaxation of such efforts, especially if coupled with
an overt Israeli nuclear doctrine, would be a powerful stimulus to
the development of an Arab nuclear capability.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>We then look at the implications of such proliferation. Would the
advent of an Arab nuclear capability lead to greater stability in the
region in the same way that mutual deterrence between the superpowers
kept the peace? Unfortunately the book pre-dates the current peace
process in the region. Professor Evron deduces, perhaps
unsurprisingly, that the acquiring of nuclear weapons by some of the
Arab states would not improve stability. He is not convinced that
Israel's ambiguous nuclear posture was a factor in Iraq's Gulf War
tactics. This brings him to the dilemma in his title. He concludes
that "in a situation where the alternatives are either a nuclearized
Middle East or a Middle East in which no state (including Israel) has
nuclear capability, the latter is preferable". The non-Israeli reader
will doubtless find the deduction entirely reasonable. It is however
interesting that a leading Israeli academic should come to this view.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The book concludes with an agenda for possible nuclear arms
control measures in the region. These are perhaps more easily
realised in the emerging new security environment in the Middle East.
His hope is that the emergence of a region committed to economic and
social development may, in the long run, bring complete
denuclearization in the Middle East. That too is perhaps more likely
now than when Professor Evron penned the thought.</P>
