			<p><font size="-1">Mr President, we meet at a time when international security is in a worse state than it has been in the lifetime of the majority of Union members here tonight. We face a real and growing threat from al-Qaeda style international terrorism where the possibility of mass casualties here in the UK is very real. North Korea is posturing with its new nuclear capability and long range delivery systems. India and Pakistan remain on the brink of a possible war which has a potential for nuclear disaster. Israel and the Palestinians are locked in an ever downward spiral of violence which seems to have no solution. The Ivory Coast is just the latest example of savage civil wars on the African continent. I could go on: Afghanistan is not yet stabilised, Northern Ireland remains a local problem for us, Latin America is showing worrying signs of reverting to undemocratic regimes, China is still waiting for Taiwan. Yet our current focus is the expected war in Iraq. Why, with so many other troubles are we fretting about a clapped out regime that has been successfully contained for more than a decade? It is because it will be the first test of the new US strategic policy of pre-emption: a policy of strike first and strike early.</font></p>
			<h4><font size="-1">US Strategy</font></h4>
			<p><font size="-1">The formulation of the new US national security strategy has been years in the making. The Republican thinks tanks had been working away during the Clinton years on academic theories of how to use the overwhelming military and economic strength of the United States to enhance its security. When Donald Rumsfeld became Defence Secretary for the second time in his life, he was brimming over with ideas on how to transform the US military capability. But it is unlikely that he, and his acolytes, could have made much progress without the attacks of 9/11. That changed the feeling of the whole of America to a new sense of vulnerability. Those advocating new strategies for security had a ready national audience. </font></p>
			<p><font size="-1">The new US Strategy document, published one year after the destruction of the World Trade Center, is worth reading. It has much that is wise in it. However, the section on preventing the threat from weapons of mass destruction was the most controversial. It speaks of the need for anticipatory action &#150; and &quot;to forestall or prevent hostile acts by adversaries, the US, will if necessary act pre-emptively.&quot; This is a radical change in the way the international system has worked over the past 50 years. We have grown away from the view that Might is Right. The developing body of international law has constrained when military force could be used. It could be used in self defence either after an attack or when such an attack was clearly about to take place. It could be used to prevent genocide. However an attack by one country on another when there was no such justification, or authorisation through the United Nations, is an act of aggression. It is difficult yet to see all the possible ramifications of the new pre-emptive US strategy&#150; but let me look at lessons from the past &#150; and possible implications for the future with Iraq as the first test of the new strategy.</font></p>
			<h4><font size="-1">Pearl Harbour &amp; the Cold War</font></h4>
			<p><font size="-1">The US itself suffered a pre-emptive attack back in 1941 with Pearl Harbour. From the Japanese point of view this was a great military tactical success, but of course in a strategic sense it was disastrous as it brought an enraged USA into WW2, and ultimately led to the defeat of Japan. In the Cold War, a strike first strategy to prevent the growth of threats was often discussed. There were suggestions to strike the Soviet Union before it developed a large nuclear arsenal, and parallel plans for China. The world might have been a very different place today had that route been taken. I doubt that the transformation in Russia would have been possible if the west had carried out a pre-emptive strike in the 1950s &#150; or at the time of the Cuban missile crisis in 1962. Deterrence and patience brought a peaceful end to the Cold War.</font></p>
			<h4><font size="-1">Pre-emption today</font></h4>
			<p><font size="-1">We are currently on the brink of a possible pre-emptive action against Iraq. No-one believes that Iraq poses an immediate threat. It is much weaker than it was at the time of the Gulf War after more than a decade of sanctions and the elimination of its nuclear and long range missile capabilities. It doubtless has some parts of its chemical and biological weapons hidden away. But the containment and deterrence strategy of the past decade worked in keeping Saddam Hussein from any more adventures. <br>
					We have passed beyond such debate &#150; despite the millions on the streets, and the extraordinary result in Parliament yesterday evening. </font></p>
			<p><font size="-1">War will start soon as the first test of the new pre-emptive strategy. The downside risks are great, and the likely reaction around the world &#150; particularly the Arab world &#150; will be adverse. Those global security problems that I opened with &#150; Al Qaeda, Israel/Palestine, North Korea, India/Pakistan -will all be worsened. We have already seen North Korea taking the opportunity to turn the nuclear screws. Who counts the dead now in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza? We have forgotten about Afghanistan.</font></p>
			<h4><font size="-1">Long term consequences for the international order</font></h4>
			<p><font size="-1">A quick operation in Iraq which may look successful in the short term will reinforce those who advocate the strike first strategy. Already Israel is encouraging the US to deal with Iran and Syria next. We will have a new international norm. Security problems dealt with by military interventions. If a country poses a possible long term threat to the US, then it will be added to the list of states that might find themselves in the firing line. This new imperialism will reinforce those. like al Qaeda, that seek recruits to attack the West by new non-State ways.<br>
					Orwellian future.<br>
					Make no mistake, we are moving to an Orwellian future unless we can get the international system working again. Recent events have damaged the UN, the EU and NATO. We are already less safe, and moving into the world of Orwell's 1984, where we are in a state of continual war, where the State is right and brooks no criticism. As President Bush has made clear: you are either with us or against us.</font></p>
			<h4><font size="-1">Conclusion:</font></h4>
			<p><font size="-1">Some of you may take comfort from the thought that big friendly America is prepared to take on threats around the world on our behalf. Dealing with possible emerging threats before they grow too large may seem sensible. But it is strategic misjudgement, counterproductive, illegal and immoral. If you want to have any hope of a world of greater international order, peace for your children and hope for humankind, you will soundly defeat this ill- conceived strategy which says might is right, and vote against the motion.</font></p>
