			<h4><b>Debate on Armed Forces Chain of Command</b></h4>
			This is the draft speech - to read actual text delivered see<a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/50714-13.htm#50714-13_spnew1"> Hansard 14 July 2005</a></div>

			<p>My Lords it has been an important debate. If I have one regret, it is that the cast list might be described as the usual suspects. It has been impressive to hear from every one of the noble and gallant lords, and from those of your lordships who take a special interest in the armed forces. It would have been interesting to hear more contributions from the many experts in law who sit in this house, and I regret that we have not.</p>
			<p>I have found preparing for this debate extraordinarily difficult. Inevitably one tends to focus on the particulars of individual cases, and Trooper Williams is a prime example in this. Yet of course, individual cases may not be appropriate to generalise to major changes in law.&nbsp; I shall deal with the lessons to be learned from the specifics of this, and other cases; but I shall want to separate out what this means for the legal and disciplinary regime under which our armed forces operate.</p>
			<p>There was a debate which covered similar issues in the other place on 14 June 2005. In opening that debate Mr Julian Brazier said (Hansard Col 227):</p>
			<p><i>&quot;</i><i>we owe a special duty of care to those men and women who are required to take daily risks with their lives on our behalf, and to carry out duties that no other job requires. The military structure has to provide them with a working environment in which there are clearly understood rules, and with an ethos that enables men and women who regard themselves as ordinary to deliver quite extraordinary things again and again. &quot;</i></p>
			<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
			<p>I would wish to associate these benches with those remarks. We are extraordinarily fortunate that we have a military of which we can be rightly proud. We must also make sure that we do not allow the government of the day to exploit their loyalty and lack of voice. However, we need also to consider what it is that makes our military work this way. Why do they, almost without exception, operate within the rule of law, and hence are most effective in the difficult support of civil power type of operations?&nbsp; A major part of this is training and leadership. The number of cases where British forces are alleged to be operating beyond the law are extraordinarily few given the range of worldwide operations which they are undertaking, and the provocations which they may have. We can be proud that we have a military which promotes justice and the rule of law.</p>
			<p>To operate within the rule of law requires our forces to be subject to these laws. Because insurgents ignore human rights and Geneva conventions, we are not excused from our responsibilities. In Iraq, our aim is promote democracy and the rule of law &#150; this means that we must operate within the rules, which are inevitably more constraining than those when we are fighting a hot war. Once we try to justify a lower standard, we are on a slippery slope. We have seen at Abu Graib what an ambiguous message from above can lead to. Most importantly, such abuses lead to greater resentment and feed insurgencies.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;Our ratification of the International Criminal Court was a major step forward in making a better world; the government was right to take the European Convention on Human Rights into our national law<i>; and we should not ignore the obligations that both put us under</i>.&nbsp; While some noble Lords may worry that the ICC could come in to play in a case against a UK service person, we support the government view that &quot;there would have to be a catastrophic failure of the UK criminal justice system for the ICC to assume jurisdiction&quot;.</p>
			<p>From this, noble Lords will understand that I am not sympathetic to the calls for exemptions for our own military on peace support operations<b> </b>This does not mean that I am<b> </b>content with the way our armed forces are supported by the government in their difficult work. The cases that we have seen demonstrate that there is a real problem which the MOD must address.</p>
			<p>Mistakes were made in the handling of the Trooper Williams case. The whole unfortunate cycle of events started, according to Don Touhig's and the Noble Lord, Lord Goldsmith's statements, when senior army staff became concerned about the legal advice given to Trooper William's CO. There had been a blunder, which led to the overturning of the CO's decision. The second blunder was a misjudgement, with the benefit of hindsight, by the CPS to go for trial when the case would not succeed. These errors were compounded by unacceptable delay; although the crime Trooper Williams supposedly committed occurred in August 2003, civilian prosecution was not initiated until September 2004, over a year later.<b> </b>The problem is that the person who suffers in all of this is Trooper Williams who has to live in fear of imprisonment for murder over a prolonged time.</p>
			<p>I do not doubt that the noble Lord, the Minister, will assure us that Trooper Williams received every support from the MOD. Yet, there seems to be a valid argument that more could and should have been done. We have begun to grow too used to the MOD hardening its collective heart to the detriment individuals in the armed forces, whether it is Gulf War veterans, married quarters, pension and redundancy schemes, inquiries into abuse of trainees, or any other difficult issues. The duty of care that the government has to its armed forces is greater than to any other section of its employees. They cannot go on strike, they cannot speak out, they must go where sent, and if necessary be prepared to give their lives</p>
			<p>The lessons from the Trooper William's case, and others in the pipeline, are surely that the MOD must investigate all allegations promptly and fully. This means providing the necessary resources in terms of military investigators and legal expertise. We cannot have months go past with those accused in a legal limbo. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, rightly asserted in a debate on the 24<sup>th</sup> of November 2004 that &ldquo;The military police are desperately overstretched and have been for some time.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>In the tragic case involving the death of a five year old girl caught up in the ropes of recreational balloon operated by a soldier, it has taken 2 years to come to court martial.&nbsp;&nbsp; Judge Blackett is reported as saying: &quot;The army prosecution service is to be criticised severely for letting the case run for so long. Lack of budget and manpower resources is simply no excuse when dealing with homicide.&quot; He is right, these timescales are neither fair to the accused or to victims. Will the Minister assure us that the MOD is increasing the number of personnel both in the legal services and the investigation units?&nbsp; Commanding Officers must also<b> </b>be able to depend on the legal advice that they receive in reviewing cases. Perhaps the Minister could explain why it went wrong in the Williams case, and what has been done to rectify the situation.&nbsp; <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>
			<p>Furthermore, in the event that a member of the armed forces has to face civilian charges in a civilian court, he or she must receive full support on the basis that they are innocent until proved guilty. Can the Minister tell the House, what changes the MOD is going to make to provide full support to members of the armed forces, who find themselves facing civilian prosecution?</p>
			<p>My Lords, we are all justly proud of our armed forces, who are now being asked to operate in the most difficult of circumstances under the rule of law. The vast majority manage to do this with outstanding results, but there will inevitably be allegations, from time to time, which need to be investigated swiftly, and where there is evidence of wrong doing brought to trial.&nbsp; We might take comfort from a detailed report which will be launched next week into the breakdown of Iraqi casualties since the intervention. Those attributed to UK military action are remarkably few in number, as one would hope in an action where we are attempting to help the Iraqi people rebuild their country. Our military achieves all of that by operating under the rule of law without exemption. I hope it will continue to do so. The current set of rules do not compromise the chain of command provided that everyone does their job properly, and that must include sufficient support from the MOD.</p>
