<H3>March to the Centre</H3>

<P>	The Strategic Defence Review (1), published by the British
Government last Summer, met with critical acclaim both from the
international security community and from the UK armed forces. The
acceleration of moves towards joint service organisations was widely
recognised as sensible for both operational effectiveness  and
resource efficiency reasons. The three service Chiefs endorsed the
review with individual messages showing their enthusiasm for the
plans(2).  Many were surprised at the apparent ease with which
previously intractable inter-service disputes had been solved. In
particular, the RAF seemed to have conceded a number of its key
activities to the other two services. </P>

<P>	A deeper look at the implications of the Review suggests that
it is more significant for the way in which it has further diminished
the power of all three service lobbies. The transfer of power has not
been from one service to another, but has been significantly from the
Royal Navy, the Army and the RAF to the Centre and the Joint
Headquarters. Lord Mountbatten's vision of a fully unified Ministry
of Defence, first articulated in 1962 (3), is now within sight of
being achieved. This article argues that the role, status and
location of the three service Chiefs will be increasingly questioned
as the findings of the Review are implemented.   </P>

<P>A Century of Inefficiency</P>

<P>	The search for an efficient method of strategic planning is not
new. Florence Nightingale had drawn public attention to the
inefficiencies of the bureaucracy of the War Office in the Crimea
War: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>" a very slow office, an enormously
expensive office, a not very efficient office, and one in which the
minister's intentions can be entirely negatived by all his
sub-departments, and those of each of the subdepartments by every
other."  (4)</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> If the War Office was unmanageable internally, neither it nor the
Admiralty  saw any need to work together. While the Army kept to the
land and the Royal Navy kept to the sea, such independence could be
made to work for most of the time. However the development of the
manned aircraft as a war-winning weapon brought a new dimension to
inter-service rivalry. The Royal Flying Corps, established in 1912,
followed by the Royal Naval Air Service two years later, ensured that
the development of air power in Britain would be characterised by
turf wars and a lack of planning coherence. In 1916, Lord Curzon
wrote a note for the Cabinet explaining that we had lost mastery of
the air: "The evidence is incontestable that there has been a great
lack of co-operation, and a competition, often the reverse of
advantageous, between the two services"(5). He became chairman of a
newly formed Air Board, but within five months announced that it was
impossible to develop a coherent policy given the attitude of the
Admiralty. Aircraft production was concentrated under a single head
in 1917. General Smuts was tasked with producing a report on Air
Organisation for the Cabinet. This report led to the formation of the
Air Ministry and the establishment of the Royal Air Force in 1918.
The answer to the inefficiencies of inter-service rivalry in World
War 1 was the creation of a third service. </P>

<P>	There were those who looked upon the Air Ministry as a device
for wartime, and pressed for a return to two departments of State
when the war ended. It was fortunate for the fledgling air force that
Churchill was appointed as Secretary for War and Air, which allowed
him to promote his long held views about the importance of proper
management of air power. However, the disputes were now between three
rather than two services. In 1936,  the post of Minister for
Co-ordination of Defence was established with Sir Thomas Inskip as
the first incumbent.  It was the period where the  Air  Ministry was 
the major user of resources for the bomber programme, the Royal Navy
had second call on money, and the army was the poor cousin. The
Inskip report of 1937 may have changed the priority for spending from
offence to defence, but it still left the RAF in the lead with the
need to build up air defences. </P>

<P>	Churchill's appointment as Prime Minister in May 1940  saw a
concerted effort to point all the players in the same direction.
Churchill became Minister for Defence and shunted the individual
service ministers out of the War Cabinet.  He ran defence planning
and resource allocation as a Prime Ministerial task. After the war,
this centralised control suffered a set back with the establishment
of the Cabinet Defence Committee which took its input from the
Admiralty, the War Office and the Air Ministry. Although the Minister
of Defence was the deputy chairman of the committee, the Chiefs of
Staff and the individual ministers sat on the committee and were thus
able to bypass him.  The individual service ministers had their own
appropriations and  each service went its own way. </P>

<H3>The Mountbatten Vision</H3>

<P>	Suez exposed the weaknesses of the divided organisation both in
terms of planning and execution, and Prime Minister Macmillan charged
Duncan Sandys with sorting it out. In 1958, Sandys' White Paper on
defence organisation (6) sought to develop an organisational
structure which would  make the defence minister responsible for
"formulation and general application of a unified policy relating to
the Armed Forces and their requirements." A new post of Chairman of
the Chiefs of Staff had been created in 1956 (Lord Mountbatten claims
that he had suggested it to Eden) (7), and this post now became Chief
of the Defence Staff. The individual service chiefs retained their
right of access to the PM and their individual ministers. This was
the time of the Sandys Review, and its projected cutback in manned
aircraft for air defences did little to help bed the arrangement down
well. Sandys had a remit to cut defence expenditure, and he took
little notice of the views of the individual service chiefs. There
was perhaps more unity generated by the common dislike of Sandys from
each of the services. As a result his proposals were watered down and
progress to a unified central control was slowed.</P>

<P>	It was not until 1963, that a truly unified Ministry of Defence
came into being as a result of the work of Lord Mountbatten who was
the second in post as the Chief of Defence Staff (1958 to 1965).
Mountbatten argued successfully that the individual service
ministries must be abolished if the Defence Minister was ever to be
able to take control. This made Peter Thorneycroft the first
Secretary of State for Defence, with the individual service ministers
reduced to ministers of state who had to act through the Defence
Secretary. Mountbatten also intended that the service chiefs would,
in a parallel way, tender their advice through the CDS. However the
battle fought by the service chiefs was successful and they retained
their individual roles and responsibility for military operations The
procurement organisation was also formed, and the Defence Operational
Requirements Staff came into being in an attempt to get inter-service
agreement about longer term plans. The new Ministry of Defence meant
that 4 departments of state disappeared (3 services and aviation).
The Secretary of State became responsible for all questions of policy
and administration of the fighting services. He would have 3
principle advisers: the Chief of the Defence Staff, the Permanent
Under Secretary and the Chief Scientific Adviser. Mountbatten
remained concerned about the disruptive effect of the vestigial
remains of the 3 service departments and was clear that the goal must
be a completely functional organisation. (8) </P>

<P>	The 1964 election of a Labour Government, with its small
majority, was a mixed blessing in terms of MOD reform.  The Geraghty
Committee of 1966 produced a plan for a radical restructuring which
would eliminate the single service boards, and have a Defence
Management Board responsible  for procurement, personnel and
logistics. The plan did not find favour and was not implemented.
Denis Healey did bring the three service intelligence organisations
together however. In 1967 the service ministers were downgraded a
further notch, and two new ministers of state posts for
Administration and Equipment were established, and in 1970 the junior
service ministers disappeared entirely, but were restored the
following year by the new Conservative Government (but with much
limited remits). </P>

<H3>The Thatcher Legacy</H3>

<P>	The weakening of the power base within the ministry of the
individual service chiefs has been much slower, but the move from
three independent kingdoms to a unified central headquarters has
continued from 1970, when the powers of the CDS were increased. The
70s saw little movement in the power struggle between the single
services and the central control advocates. It was a difficult time
with a succession of financial crises The arrival of Margaret
Thatcher as prime Minister in 1979 had a number of effects on
defence. The pay awards of the dying Callaghan government were
accelerated and defence took a higher priority in government
thinking. Nevertheless, Mrs Thatcher was not impressed by the waste
and inefficiency of the MOD. She replaced her first Defence Minister,
Francis Pym, when he did not seem to be sorting out defence to her
satisfaction. John Nott came in charged to shake up the organisation.
His Review looked to change the  traditional carve up of the cake
between the services. Keith Speed, the Navy minister, was sacked when
he spoke out against cuts to the Navy, and was not replaced. His was
the final death knell for the single service ministers, thus at last
severing the direct link between the individual services and
Parliament. </P>

<P>	Michael Heseltine,who followed John Nott, adopted a radical
approach to defence management. His Ministry of Defence
Organisational Review (9) was published in 1984. He had grafted on
his Management Information for Ministers System (MINIS) which had
been developed while he was at the Environment Department.   It took
little note of the single service sensitivities and was structured on
a broadly functional basis. The key change was to the
responsibilities of CDS and PUS who became jointly the principal
advisers to the Secretary of State. CDS was the adviser for military
operations and strategy, while PUS looked after political and
financial policy. The VCDS and 4 DCDS posts, the 2nd PUS with the
Office of Management and Budget, the CSA and the CDP left a rather
small policy role within the MOD for the individual service chiefs,
whose boards could provide advice to the centre. The 2nd PUS was a
member of all of the service boards to give that linkage.  The Chiefs
of Staff kept proudly their right of direct access to the Prime
Minister.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Smaller but Better</H3>

<P>	As the Cold War was coming to an end, the happy days of growth
in the Defence Budget was also at an end. Whitehall was being
transformed by the New Management Strategy, which sought to align
financial and management responsibilities. The government was also
intent on privatising what it did not need to run, and making
semi-independent agencies of activities which did not need direct day
to day running from Whitehall. Contracting out of activities which
had previously been undertaken by servicemen or MOD civilians reduced
the number of defence personnel - and also showed how expensive they
were. A single commercial bidder would happily provide an operation
for all 3 services, where each service may have operated its own
previously.  The Defence Evaluation and Research Agency brought
together tracts of land owned by the services with scientists and
analysts who could operate as a defence capability rather than a
single service lobby group.</P>

<P>	An internal study, called 'Prospect', was  undertaken in 1991
into the need for each senior post.  The move to aligning financial
and management responsibility meant that the separation of the
C-in-Cs from the policy making board members was no longer
sustainable.  There was also a need to rationalise headquarters to
save money and improve efficiency. The Principle Administrative
Officers (CFS, QMG and AMSO) were double-hatted as the CinCs of the
logistics arms in each service. Likewise,the Principle Personnel
Officers (2SL, AG and AMP) became the CinCs of the three
personnel/training commands.  This had the  effect of moving most of
the individual service board members out of London. The Procurement
Executive was also undergoing changes which meant that the the three
service Controllers  were now downgraded.</P>

<P>	The next changes followed rapidly with  Malcolm Rifkind's 
Front Line First  defence review. There was very much a theme of
joint operations and training throughout the studies. Thereview was
designed to take the logic of the new management strategy
further:"there was still a gap to be closed between the principles of
Prospect and NMS and current practice" (10) Prospect had forecast a
decrease in MOD London posts from 12,700 in 1990 to 5200 in 1995.
Front Line First set a target of 3750 for 1998. The OMB and Defence
Staff compartments were to be ended. It would create "a Head Office
composed of a unified Central Staff and three small headquarters
staffs supporting the individual Chiefs of Staff as heads of their
services. Further responsibilities would be delegated to Commands"
(11).  The FPMG (Financial Planning and Management Group chaired by
the PUS) is made clearly the single key policy forum with the Chiefs
of Staff Committee as the ultimate source of professional military
advice. Front Line First also created a permanent Joint Headquarters
at Northwood.  Up until then, the appropriate service had provided
its operational headquarters for joint operations (the Navy for the
Falklands; the RAF for the Gulf War). This was a significant stepping
off point for the next stage of rationalisation.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Modern Forces for the Modern World</H3>

<P>	George Robertson, published the new Labour Government's
Strategic Defence Review (SDR) in July 1998. The SDR has taken
forward the development of the MOD, and reduced the roles of the
individual single services, in a number of significant ways. A key
innovation is the establishment of the Chief of Defence Logistics
post. Each service currently runs the majority of its own logistic
support requirements. There is some sharing of the less operationally
sensitive common needs, but  each service has a large logistic
expenditure. Each of the logistics CinCs has a budget of between one
and two billion Pounds  - over 20% of the defence budget in all.  
The grouping of the three service logistics commands into a single
central joint organisation is therefore a massive change in control
of resources. As the new CDL stated</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>Clearly, the single-service PAO posts
will disappear and the question of the best way to make certain that
CDL is represented on the Service Executive Committees is still under
discussion. (14)</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>         On the operational side the SDR also makes changes
designed to improve inter-service co-operation.  An important
indicator for the future is the making of the Chief of Joint
Operations into a Top Level Budget Holder, thus giving him  equal
status with the 3 service operational CinCs. The amount (&#163;M300)
is relatively small - 10% of CinC Land - but the significance is
great. The development of Joint Rapid Reaction Forces also points the
way to the immediately ready forces being under central command, with
the single services as second echelon activities. </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I> "The substantial expansion in both the
number and types of forces assigned to our Joint Rapid Reaction
Forces, and hence the number of operations likely to come under the
command of the Permanent Joint Headquarters, has led us to reassess
the role of the Chief of Joint Operations.......We will therefore
increase the responsibilities of the Chief of Joint Operations."
(12)</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>  All this is of course reinforced by Joint Force 2000 (Harriers),
Joint Defence Centre (Doctrine), Joint Helicopter Command, Joint
Ground Based Air Defence, Joint Nuclear, Chemical and Biological
Defence as well as of course the Joint Support through CDL. </P>

<P>What does this leave for the individual services to do? As the SDR
makes clear, the role of the single services, and their chiefs, will
be to deliver fighting capability. They will be responsible for
training, discipline and ethos. This is a  limited remit compared
with the heady days of the global strategy review when the single
service Chiefs could produce government and NATO policy.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>The 2003 Defence Review</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	The changes to the power of the individual services over the
past 80 years have been very marked. Yet, despite the establishment
of a unified Ministry of Defence in 1964, the First Sea Lord, the
Chief of the General Staff and the Chief of the Air Staff have
managed to survive successive reviews which have been designed
(overtly or covertly) to reduce or eliminate their influence. 
Nevertheless, they have progressively ceded important areas of
responsibility, and the pace of change has been quickening.  </P>

<P>	In any future Defence Review, it will be surprising if the
spotlight does not turn first on the personnel organisations. As more
and more of the key appointments will be for posts within the
enlarged joint organisations, there will be a greater need for a
joint approach to manpower planning. This will inevitably bring
pressure for rationalisation  on the personnel management areas of
the services. An independent review of the armed forces personnel
strategy (the Betts Report) in 1995 concluded that the MOD needed to
find a more effective solution to the ownership of personnel
strategy. The MOD's response (13) did little to change the long
standing, and ineffective, personnel management by committee. The
need for common standards, best practice and efficiency will
undoubtedly lead to proposals for a Chief of Defence Personnel, with
an organisation to parallel that of the new Chief of Defence
Logistics. Indeed the implementation of such a structure would be
less complex that the changes required in the logistics area.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	This leads  to interesting possibilities for longer term
developments in the service chiefs' roles. As the single service
boards, the service executive committees, have changed over the past
ten years, they have seen their key members disappear from Whitehall.
Whereas board members were once all in neighbouring offices in the
MOD main building, their Personnel and Logistics organisations are
now out of London, the Procurement Executive is at Abbey Wood, and
the operational commands are working to the Permanent Joint HQ.   The
Assistant Chiefs (ACNS, ACGS and ACAS) provide the only direct staff
resource to individual COS for coordinating and planning within the
MOD. Most of their dedicated staffs have been redeployed to provide
the central staff resource for operations, programmes and operational
requirements. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	 When it next becomes necessary to review senior posts within
the MOD, the Chiefs of Staff may find it more difficult to defend
their role. If their job is to provide fighting capability then how
does that differ from the operational C-in-Cs? Operations, logistics,
the forward programme, operational requirements, procurement,
intelligence and research are all organised centrally. Once a move is
made to centralise personnel management with a Chief of Defence
Personnel, there will be little justification for the Chiefs of Staff
to be separate posts from their operational C-in-Cs.  </P>

<P>	At the same time, there may be an longer term evolution of the
relationship between the Chief of Joint Operations (CJO) and the
three operational commanders (CinC Fleet, CinC Land and CinC Strike).
If their task is to provide operational fighting capability to the
CJO, then logic would suggest that they might become subordinate to
the CJO, who would thus be able to ensure that priority was given to
development of the most appropriate operational capability at any
given time. By this stage the heads of each of the three services
would have become the operational Commanders, and would finally be
out of the policy loop within the MOD.</P>

<P>	In such a development, single service training and ethos could
be retained but  capability would be delivered on a centrally
controlled (rather than joint) basis.  Traditionalists worry about
all three services being forced into a common uniform on the late and
unlamented Canadian model. But, most UK forces do wear the same
uniform, or specialist clothing, when on operational duties. The
formal uniforms have always been more varied within the army than
between the  services.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Would the final completion of Mountbatten's vision of a
functionally based MOD give us a defence establishment that produces
the best defence solutions without internal partisan wrangling?
Experience suggests this may be an unattainable aspiration. Just as
the unified War Office of the Crimea was beset by bureaucratic
infighting, there will doubtless be scope for vested interests to
manipulate the  system to their advantage in the 21st Century.
Whether the First Sea Lord, the Chief of the General Staff and the
Chief of the Air Staff will  be there to take part in these future
Whitehall battles seems a little less likely.	</P>
