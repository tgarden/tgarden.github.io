<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">For a while, it looked as though the MOD
might be singled out as the only department to suffer a reduction in
budget in the great CSR bonanza. The traditional series of inspired
leaks about equipment and manpower problems in the armed forces had
had their usual negative effect on the Treasury and other
Departments. The NAO report on the continuing costly mismanagement of
equipment procurement by the MOD gave extra ammunition to its
enemies. Yet there is a genuine problem with personnel retention in
some key capability areas; and every indication that morale in combat
units continues on a downward path. The high profile march of General
Sir Charles Guthrie across the road to Downing Street, to deal
directly with the Prime Minister, was just what the troops needed. He
was widely reported as making it clear to Tony Blair that the Defence
Budget needed to be increased. Of course, as we now know from the
Prime Minister's leaked minute, he was preaching to the converted.
What did this great alliance of Prime Minister and Chief of Defence
Staff achieve in the battle of the budget? The defence budget has
been given an exciting 0.3% real increase each year for the next 3
years. Assuming that the economy prospers as forecast, this will mean
that Defence will continue to take a smaller and smaller share of
GDP. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">A rise in real terms, however small, is
obviously more welcome to the armed forces than the cuts that have
been implemented every year since 1987. Yet this will not solve the
problems. To an extent, the severity of the problem has been
recognised by the objectives which have been set in the CSR. Manning
requirements for the Royal Navy and the RAF are not  to be met until
2004. Yet in evidence earlier in the year to the Defence Committee,
the RAF made it clear that it could not solve its fast jet pilot
shortage within three years whatever the resource assumptions . For
the Army, the target set  is to meet 97% of the manpower requirement
by 2004. That equates to a continuing shortfall of 3000 soldiers at a
time when overstretch is the greatest concern of army leadership. In
the convoluted world of objectives, we have also a target to "Ensure
that by 2005 a minimum of 90 per cent of rapidly available military
units are at required states of readiness." Presumably this means
that  10% of our rapid reaction forces will be neither rapid nor
reactive.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The big problem for the political and
military leadership in the MOD is that defence costs rise far faster
than normal inflation. Equipment costs have risen at many times the
RPI, and smart procurement will at best only slightly change this.
The bleeding of manpower will mean that labour costs will also rise,
and the CSR acknowledges the importance of funding people programmes.
The tiny increase in defence spending will be swallowed up quickly by
the thousands of cost rises that occur every year in the defence
programme. Like all its predecessors, the Strategic Defence Review
will prove unaffordable and something will have to give. It may be
Eurofighter deliveries (either in number or in timing), or it may be
the ambitious aircraft carrier plans. Either way, the main hope for
the UK continuing to deliver real military capability must be in
deepening its co-operation with its European allies, who all have
similar problems. </FONT></P>
