			<p><font size="-1">The rush to war in Iraq gives an opportunity for every merchant of spin to stir the pot. Plagiarised academic writings are attributed to impeccable intelligence sources. International terrorism,  local dissidents and tin pot dictators are linked with nuclear weapons  by inadequate commas. Old inspectors' reports are rehashed to sound like new discoveries of Iraqi deception. Osama bin Laden's recordings are called in aid without wondering whether war in Iraq might suit his purpose rather well. But the real sign of desperation is when the war advocates  start calling their critics appeasers.  <br>
					<br>
					Adolf Hitler and Saddam Hussein share a number of common characteristics. Both showed little regard for human rights, international law and democratic process. Military force was their preferred diplomatic tool. They both failed to make a nuclear bomb, but spent a lot of national effort trying to do so. They also had to work  under international restrictions on development of particular military capability. Does this mean that there are historic parallels between  the Baldwin-Chamberlain policy of appeasement of Germany in the run up to World War 2 and the widespread criticism of US policy towards military intervention in Iraq?<br>
					<br>
					Germany, after openly breaking the Versailles Treaty by rearming and creating the Luftwaffe,  reoccupied the Rhineland, succeeded in Anschluss with Austria and annexed the Czech Sudetenland. Iraq failed in its bloody five year campaign against Iran, was ousted from Kuwait,  and has been a declining military power since the UN inspectors started their work twelve years ago. Appeasement in the 1930s was a policy which allowed Germany to grow in military might,  occupy new territory and directly threaten Europe without retribution. While the US and its allies can rightly be accused of collaboration with Saddam Hussein in the 1980s, our policy since the Gulf War has been a remarkably successful mixture of containment and deterrence. <br>
					<br>
					But are France and Germany now guilty of appeasement if they try to delay precipitate use of military force to disarm Iraq of any weapons of mass destruction that it may have?  In 1991,  Iraq's  programme to build  a nuclear bomb was fairly far advanced.  The vast infrastructure to enrich uranium was destroyed by the UN inspectors. Today nobody suggests that Iraq has managed to re-establish this capability. Certainly Saddam Hussein continues to desire membership of the nuclear club, but he is further away from realising this dream than a number of other proliferators &#150; not least North Korea. He almost certainly continues to hide stocks of chemical weapons.  Yet deterrence has prevented their use ever since the West stopped supporting his adventures.  Biological weapons are a real concern. They have little utility for operational military use, but they represent a strategic threat which could be used against civilian centres of population. Again, the retribution that would follow their use ensures that they would only be wheeled out in the end game of any war of survival.  Finally, the delivery systems for such strategic weapons that he may have  are now much depleted.  We worry whether he has managed to add another 30 km range to his battlefield missiles. He now has very few,  if any, reliable long range missiles.<br>
					<br>
					The contrast between  pre-War Germany and Iraq could scarcely be more stark.  In Iraq today, we face a third world country which has been declining in military strength ever since we stopped supporting its regional power strategy. Containment,  sanctions and robust retaliation to military adventurism  has been effective. With no threat to Europe, America or even to Iraq's neighbours, war seems a very odd choice.<br>
