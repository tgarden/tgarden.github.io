<ADDRESS><CENTER>National Liberal Club 1 December 1998
</CENTER></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER></ADDRESS>

<P>	I was speaking at an undergraduate meeting at Oxford last month
about  the future of nuclear weapons in the world, and I suddenly
realised that my audience had no personal memories of the Cold War:
it has joined the other two great wars of the century as something to
be studied as history. For those of us who were at university during
the Cuban missile crisis, and have spend most of our lives under the
shadow of an East West conflict, it is sometimes difficult to
remember how profound the change is. </P>

<P>	We are now free to devote more effort to international
injustice, and we have a sense that virtue is to be rewarded.
Whereas, there were times in the Cold War when it was by no means
clear that democracy would replace totalitarianism, the western
liberal nations are now confident that history is with them. The
collapse of the Soviet Union and  the dismemberment of its repressive
empire, was rapidly followed by the Gulf War with its coalition of
states who would not allow Iraq to take over Kuwait.  Even the
alternative to liberal democracies in the Far East, characterised by
Asian Values, seems to have its come-uppance through the economic
crisis of the past year. The ripples of that financial chaos have not
yet finished, and the future of the Japanese economy has
international security implications.</P>

<P>	Yet, despite the comforting trends for the West, in the UK we
have found ourselves close to using significant military force in
anger 3 times this year - twice in Iraq and once over Kosovo. Two
states, India and Pakistan, have tested nuclear devices. Turkey and
Syria have come close to war over the Kurds. Turkey and Greece looked
as though they might draw blood over Russian missiles in Cyprus.
North Korea has heightened tension in the peninsular. The killing has
continued in Algeria. Indonesia may fall into anarchy or military
dictatorship. Last week's difficulties during President Jiang's visit
to Japan reminded us that China remains serious about Taiwan, and the
possible use of military force if necessary. Violence continues in
sub-saharan Africa.There has been no lack of international violence,
and we are not isolated from it in Britain.</P>

<H3>Wider Security Concerns</H3>

<P>	Security has always been about more than military defence.
Economic well being is part of a nation's security. Crime, and in
particular international crime associated with drugs, and the
corruption which follows it can undermine democracy every bit as
effectively as an invading army. We have also come to realise that
environmental degradation is a global security issue. If global
warming raises the sea levels, countries like Bangladesh may shrink
to a fraction of their current size. Changes to weather patterns can
be as destructive as war, as we have just seen in Central America.
Shortage of fresh water is a growing security issue, and can lead to
military actions. Population growth can lead not just to famine, but
to undemocratic forces for change, as one sees in places like Egypt.
These undemocratic forces turn to terrorism as the way to further
their aims. The buzz word these days is asymmetric warfare. The rich
states arm themselves with modern weapon systems that have little
relevance against the determined terrorist.  Disease is also a
security issue. The spread of Aids in Africa receives less attention
in the West than the health of the Japanese economy. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	It is not however my aim to spoil what has been a very pleasant
dinner by letting you all leave in a black despond of gloom. Unlike
Michael Portillo, speaking at the RUSI last Friday, I do not believe
we are in more danger of a nuclear exchange than any time in the past
30 years. I wanted to set the scene by reminding you that global
security is a far more complex topic than just the question of
military defence.  </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	The fears that I have described are real, but perhaps are less
daunting than the fear of nuclear annihilation which we lived with
for 40 years. On my first flying tour in Germany, we would have to
sleep by our aircraft, which were armed with nuclear bombs, so that
we could be in the air within 15 minutes and on the way to our
targets in the East. The security risk was global and very hair
trigger. Yet the international community managed it successfully. We
have more time to develop mechanisms for managing these new security
concerns, but the international community is less able to deal with
problems before they become crises. And I should like to spend the
remainder of the short time I have to dwell on my hopes in this
respect, and as a result what policies I believe Britain should be
pursuing.</P>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>NATO and European Defence</H3>

<P>	The change that has been needed in defence posture in the west 
following the end of the cold war is enormous and we are in the
middle of a transition process. NATO has been surprisingly quick in
transforming itself for such a large consensus driven organisation.
It rewrote its concept in 1991, and is now working on a new 
strategic concept to be launched at its 50th birthday party next
April in Washington. It has adjusted from static defence of the inner
German border to putting together forces for the succession of crises
over the break up of the former Yugoslavia. It has worked hard at is
enlargement, and will take in 3 countries a s full members next year:
Poland, Czech Republic and Hungary, but it has also been working with
most European nations including Russia through Partnership for Peace.
It has a special arrangement to deal with Russia and with the Ukraine
on a one to one basis. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Nevertheless the disparity in capability between the United States
and all the other NATO countries put together continues to widen. At
a recent NATO conference that I attended, delegates lamented the fact
the total European defence effort was  less even than the sum of its
parts. Lord Gilbert quantified it in the house last week as 60% of
the US budget producing 10% of the US capability.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>UK Defence Reviews</H3>

<P> 	In the UK we have had 3 reviews of our defence forces since the
end of the Cold War. The latest was finished in July and has met with
international acclaim. Yet British forces are now tiny and are
tailored to be a part of a larger force for any serious military
action. You will have seen the testing a fortnight ago of the new
submarine launched cruise missile capability which the Royal Navy is
acquiring. A modern weapon system, but the total numbers will be only
a fraction of those that the US routinely use as the opening salvo
against Iraq when it gets out of line. The two carriers planned for
2012 will show that we intend to retain our role as a nation which is
prepared to act around the world, but realistically will do so only
as a part of a larger force, which will at the moment inevitably be
American.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	I welcome therefore the moves that have taken place over the
last couple of months to look at how Europe can act more effectively,
and the radical change in the UK position over the involvement of the
EU in defence matters. Of course nothing concrete has yet been
proposed, but the change in language was necessary to make a start.
It is bizarre that Europe which is as populous and wealthy as the US,
is unable to act as an equal partner in providing for its own
security. A real European Security and Defence Identity will
strengthen co-operation with the US, and stabilise the difficult
regions on the edge of Europe. The most difficult and dangerous of
these remains Russia. Not because of its military strength but
because of its economic weakness, coupled with the left over armoury,
including nuclear weapons, of the Cold War. The solution is not a
military one, but the West must, in its own interests, do whatever it
can to rebuild the Russian economy.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Crime &amp; Corruption</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Russia also suffers from crime and corruption. In many ways these
two are much greater worldwide threats to democracy than military
action or terrorism. The international drug trade generates
unimaginable sums of money, undermining governments in the producing
countries as well as the consuming states. Police forces are often
undervalued, under resourced and under paid. Once the police become
part of the problem the decline can be severe. There are countries in
Latin America and Southern Africa where this is the key to the
problem. Again, the West needs to look at ways to provide training
and assistance for developing effective, and respected police forces.
There must also be a question as to whether current policies on drugs
help or hinder. But that perhaps strays too far from my main theme
this evening.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Environmental Concerns</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	A truly global security issue that  is gaining much greater
understanding is that of environmental degradation. Whether it is
global warming, ozone layer depletion, declining fish stocks,
decreasing biodiversity, or reducing supplies of fresh water, the
problems have to be tackled at the regional or global level. As with
so many problems, solutions cannot be found at the national level. It
is difficult to see how global security can be enhanced without moves
towards more effective supranational organisations. The difficulties
that have arisen from the attempts to attach environmental
legislation to the rulings of the World Trade Organisation show both
the difficulties, but also the possibilities. The Kyoto Conference
may have been too timid, but it made a start and holds out the
promise of a more effective global regime developing. We have a real
problem as the developing world, and in particular China, develops
and increases its per capita energy consumption towards that which we
accept in the developed world. It may be that we have to come back to
nuclear energy despite the long term worries that are entailed.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Health</H3>

<P>	Disease is also an area which needs attention from the
international community. It is becoming clear that many of the
plagues of the past are returning as they become more resistant to
modern drugs. And they are becoming more resistant at a faster rate
than the counters can be developed. It may be that the wonders of
genetic engineering will offer new solutions, and that the rise in
disease, which has been much assisted by international travel, will
turn out to be but a temporary blip. More worrying is the dedicated
application of genetic engineering techniques to warfare. Biological
weapons have up to now been of limited appeal to attackers because of
their unpredictable effectiveness and long time delay. They, with
chemical weapons, were more useful in forcing an opponent to take
protective measures. There is now a real danger that they could be
designed to be much more narrowly targeted and be faster acting. As a
weapon of mass destruction they are much easier to produce covertly
than nuclear weapons, easier to conceal, and the materials for
production are much more readily available. The international
community has outlawed them, but needs to continue to take every
precaution against development by rogue states or by terrorist
organisations. This will involve intrusive verification regimes which
will meet much commercial resistance in the West as well as in the
target states.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Conclusion</H3>

<P>	In summary, we have moved from a highly dangerous world of the
Cold War to a world where the threats are more varied and operate
over different timescales. The world finds it more difficult to
respond to possible future problems, than it does to crises. Yet it
is always less painful to take preventative measures. </P>

<P>In Britain, we really are more secure than at any other time this
century. Even so, we have traditional military needs to carry out our
international responsibilities. Despite being Europe's most effective
military power, we are tiny and not very effective on our own.
Problems need to be tackled at the regional or global level. Moves
towards an EU defence capability are therefore welcome, and the new
post of High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy will be
important. The UN remains the key to global responses, but will
continue to find it difficult to achieve consensus for the more
difficult operations. The most urgent security problem for us is the
Russian nuclear stockpile in a country that is falling apart, but
there are plenty of emerging problems that will be easier to tackle
earlier rather than later.</P>
