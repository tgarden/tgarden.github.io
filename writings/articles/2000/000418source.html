Way</FONT></CENTER></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">It was an ironic piece of timing, just as
the NASDAQ was in freefall,  to announce the launch of the Defence
Evaluation &amp; Research Agency (DERA) as a future high tech stock
opportunity. After trailing a possible privatisation nearly two years
ago, the Government has still to make a firm decision. Ministers
launched a </FONT><FONT
COLOR="#000000"><A HREF="http://www.mod.uk/commercial/ppp/dera/">new
consultation document</A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> on 17 April.
The preferred plan is now to split the organisation into two parts:
NewDERA and Retained DERA. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The retained core competence part of the
organisation is uncontroversial. The MOD would keep control of the
most sensitive research such as that at Porton Down, and would also
be able to pacify US  concerns. However three quarters of the 11,500
strong agency, with a current turnover of &#163;1 billion a year,
would be floated as NewDERA during 2001. The consultation document
hypes the concept with:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">"NewDERA has the
potential to become a globally-branded, technology-based
knowledge-provider in the new economy of the 21st
century."</FONT></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">It may be that the previously feather-bedded
DERA can make the transition to commercial success, but it has had a
somewhat narrow and secure customer base in the past. In any event,
that is a problem for investors rather than Government. Would such a
split damage defence research? Provided the Core Competence model
includes adequate independent intelligent customer capability then
outsourcing other research should not cause a problem. The real
damage may come from the lost opportunity to pool the defence
research effort across the EU as a part of rationalising European
defence spending. NewDERA and Retained DERA will continue to compete
and duplicate the work of other research establishments. If Europe is
to match the US in this field, it needs to generate a critical mass
for research effort by merging rather than dividing.</FONT></P>
