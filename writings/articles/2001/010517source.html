			<h3>Foreign &amp; Defence Policy in the Election </h3>
			<p>by Sir Timothy Garden</p>

			<p>There are no surprises in the three main parties&#146; election pitches for defence and foreign policy. Indeed the only notable feature is the lack of any real interest in making it an election issue. The last four years has seen the government using the armed forces in a very wide range of undertakings. There are plenty of operational successes to highlight. Kosovo was very much Tony Blair's war, and he came out of it well as a leader. Yet the poltical outcome could have been very different if NATO had failed to hold a consensus, or if Milosevic had refused to budge under air bombardment alone. The UK contributions to East Timor and to Sierra Leone have been wholly beneficial, and could claim to show an ethical dimension to foreign policy at its best. Again, failure in Sierra Leone was a possibility and would have caused serious questions of political judgement. Iraq has remained a constant problem. The UK government has stood alongside the US both in sanctions policy and in military activity. This has not always been helpful in Europe.But the policy has been reasonably successful in containing the Saddam problem. On a more parochial level, the British military have been seen by some as the saviours of MAFF in the Foot and Mouth outbreak. Geoff Hoon, the Defence Secretary, has projected a  rather more reassuring image than the hapless Nick Brown.<br>
				<br>
				Even outside of operations, security policy has been at the forefront of the Labour Government&#146;s foreign policy work. Blair started the ball rolling over European defence, which for years had been stuck because of British opposition.The advances leading to the Helsinki goals for an EU deployable military capability have all stemmed from the PM&#146;s personal commitment from his meeting at St Malo onwards.  Nor should it be forgotten that George Robertson, the first Defence Secretary of the then new Labour administration, conducted a moderately radical, and widely acclaimed, defence review. In more recent times, Geoff Hoon achieved considerable success in getting a small, but real, uplift in funds for the defence budget. New arangements for joined up government bewteen the MOD, FCO and DIFD are also encouraging signs of security being viewed in the wider sense.<br>
				<br>
				However, there have also been some less encouraging issues in the foreign and security policy field. The most important must be the sharp decline in manpower across the services. The army is 8000 men under strength. The RAF has a large and increasing shortfall in pilots; and the problem is even worse for the RN Sea Harriers. The increased number of commitments coupled with shortages of personnel seems to be leading to a downward spiral of exits by experienced people. In the case of the military medical speciality, this has become an insoluble problem. Some argue that the government's push for the Services to come into line with civilian practice on equal opportunities, racial awareness, homosexual acceptance, human rights legislation, health and safety requirements, and compensation practices have all exacerbated the problem.<br>
				<br>
				Nor does Robin Cook seem to have fully delivered on his promise of a more ethical foreign policy. There has been some greater transparency in the field of arms sales, but they continue supply weapons to dubious corners of the world. There has been an unwillingness to debate the problems caused by the new US administration whether in the field of missile defence, arms control, environment, Israel, North Korea or China. The government still appears to value its US relationship above the European one when times get difficult.<br>
				<br>
				It has therefore been a term of office which has provided plenty of scope for the three parties to argue deifferent policies on the basis of real events. Unfortunately, the focus groups do not appear to be the slightest bit interested. All three parties would keep defence spending at its current level. This means that the decline in capability will continue. None of them are prepared to explain how they cope with this decline. The Conservatives regret the over commitment of the forces and believe shortages must be rectified. They offer  no plan for achieving this. But then neither does the Lib Dem or Labour manifesto. The Conservatives think the major issue is to reverse the political correctness trend in the military, and prevent a European Army. The Lib Dems support moves towards Europe and oppose missile defence. They would stop export credit guarantees for arms sales.<br>
				<br>
				It is all a great pity. There are some very important policy issues coming to the boil. The current defence posture is unaffordable at current budget provisions. The military is getting very frayed at the edges, and the outflow of experience continues. It would have been exciting if one party was prepared to address the crisis head on and offer the choice of either more defence money or seriously reduced capabilities and commitments (perhaps shared with EU allies). Neither of these choices has much electorate appeal, and so each party has decided to bury the problem. The next government will have to make some difficult choices, and none of them appear in the manifestos. <br>
