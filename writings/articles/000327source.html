<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Health, Education and the Police, all saw
significant increases to their funding in Gordon Brown's Budget
statement. It was no surprise that Defence was nowhere to be seen on
the list of beneficiaries from the Chancellor's largesse. Opinion
polls had made it clear that their was little political advantage to
be gained from helping the hard pressed military with more money. The
planned budget of &#163;Bn 21.3 in 2000/01 and &#163;Bn 21.4 in
2001/02 is a shade down on the expected outturn of &#163;Bn 21.6 for
the current year. There are three questions that arise from this
disciplined approach to defence spending. Are the current strains in
the defence budget critical or merely the usual in-year problems? How
will the MOD manage its cash corset? What are the implications for
commitments, capabilities and operations?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">There are strains on the defence budget
every year as costs, both of manpower and equipment, rise faster than
inflation. When the budget appears not to be rising at all, this will
inevitably mean that some difficult decisions are required.
Currently, there are three additional factors which will cause
greater pain: Kosovo, SDR and political initiatives. The lessons of
Kosovo will require new spending on such things as stocks of
precision bombs, and the procurement of all weather precision
weapons. Replacement of insecure ground and air communications will
have become much more urgent. The Strategic Defence Review of 1998 is
still in the process of implementation. There are a number of radical
pieces of restructuring which inherently carried risk in terms of
timings and costs. The major move to a tri-service defence logistics
organisation will undoubtedly have long term running cost benefits.
However, it is a very complex process, and slippages will be costly.
Indications are that this is beginning to cause additional budgetary
problems. Conversely, while the anticipated efficiency savings were
expected to be difficult, they are currently being achieved. There
have been no lack of political initiatives to add to the troubles of
defence planners. The offer, by Robin Cook, of 10,000 troops towards
a UN rapid reaction force would be expensive if anyone at the MOD
took it seriously. It will be more difficult to ignore the call for
contributions to the new 60,000 man force for the EU, which was led
by Tony Blair at Helsinki in December. There will be difficult
decisions to take if the US reduces it presence in the Balkans,
particularly if the Northern Ireland situation deteriorates at the
same time.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">To manage these difficulties, the MOD will
adopt its usual approach of looking for savings measures to offset
overspends and new requirements In one respect, its flexibility is
now theoretically reduced with the separation of the equipment
capital budget from the in-year running costs. However, if push comes
to shove, there will doubtless be some movement between the two. We
have already seen deferment of major equipment decisions, and some
media spinning ahead of a decision to buy or lease fewer C17s than
promised in the SDR. There will be great hopes that the major study
into training, led by Vice Admiral Band, will find major savings. The
stories about the army moving to the cheaper North from expensive
Aldershot are indicative of the way thinking may go. Smart
procurement may find it falls foul of the usual programme delay
problems. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Will these difficulties affect our military
capability? The strain of too many commitments and too few people is
evident wherever one looks in the armed forces today. There are clear
worries at senior levels that the many prolonged operational
deployments are taking their toll, particularly in terms of retention
of good people. Although recruiting in the army is better than it has
been, outflow of experienced people continues across the Services.
While defence may not be a high priority among focus groups at the
moment, it will become a key political issue should British forces
fail in a highly visible mission at some future date. </FONT></P>
