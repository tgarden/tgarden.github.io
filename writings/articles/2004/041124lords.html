			<h4>Debate on Queen's Speech - 24 November 2004</h4>
		</div>
		<div align="left">
			<p>My Lords, providing security was a strong theme&nbsp; of the gracious speech. Her Majesty's Government will have much to do in the defence field. Our armed services have continued to operate impressively in all that they have been asked to do. Sadly, a number have suffered death or severe injuries particularly in the continuing Iraq operation. We are fortunate to have such dedicated and professional servicemen and women to call upon for the extraordinary range of tasks. It is often said that when it comes to the battle for resources, the armed services are their own worst enemy. Despite successive cutting, problems over equipment, and under strength units, they manage to complete each and every operation with distinction. In the hard world of public sector funding, there is no reward for success. The reverse is the case: failed enterprises are top of the list for extra resources. However, I would caution Her Majesty's Government to think hard about the long term health of Britain's Armed Forces. In that respect, I would like briefly to address three linked issues: Commitments; Personnel; and future policy.&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>Commitments&nbsp;</h3>
			<p>The Defence Select Committee in its June report said: &quot;Since the SDR of 1998, it has been apparent that the Armed Forces have been over-stretched and not simply in a few specialisms as claimed by MoD.&quot; Overstretch is an often misused concept. The military can react to surge demands and deliver 110% effort &#150; indeed that is what the military ethos is all about. The difficulty comes when such efforts are called on repeatedly, with little time for broader training between demanding operational tours. It is cumulative and insidious. There are few signs that Her Majesty's Government is facing up to this problem. On our commitments, we have Iraq as a central priority for some time to come. We need to manage that commitment wisely. It is not being &quot;a good ally&quot; to answer each and every request from the US to fill in for their shortages. We need to consolidate the excellent work done by our forces in their area of responsibility, and not put that progress at risk.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>In Afghanistan, we again have a responsibility. Our contribution to the NATO force is relatively modest, and as the Minister explained to me in his letter of 23 September we were unable to provide the support helicopters that had been requested and were sending Harriers instead. But looking forward to when the ACE Rapid Reaction Force HQ deploys to Afghanistan next year, we will, as the framework nation, presumably find ourselves with a larger commitment. In the Balkans, we appear to expect to take a lead role as NATO hands over to the EU at the end of the year, and Kosovo continues to cause concern. Presumably, we would also wish to be involved in any international security arrangement that flows from progress over Israel and Palestine. In Africa the tasks continue for our military. The excellent news that the EU is to develop a number of Battle Groups for rapid deployment, also comes with extra commitments for our troops. There are of course many other tasks and contingencies which we expect our armed forces to deal with. I look for reassurance from the Minister, that we have a strategic long term approach to keeping our global commitments more in balance with our force size.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>Personnel</h3>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Your lordships have much debated the changes inherent in the Government's latest defence white paper. The move to network enabled capabilities and effects based warfare is to be at the cost of numbers of combat units.&nbsp; As the Defence Select Committee have said:</p>
			<p>We do not believe that effects-based operations and network-enabled capability justify a reduction in the current scale of the UK's Armed Forces.</p>
			<p>But it is going to happen and will exacerbate the over-commitment problem for sustained stabilisation operations. Bizarrely, it means that at a time of overstretch, we are looking yet again at redundancy in the Services. This will be third major downsizing since the end of the Cold War. I am sure the Prime Minister has now been briefed that there are to be real reductions in the numbers of people in each of the 3 Services. It appears that compulsory redundancies will only be needed in the Royal Air Force, and that natural wastage will be used in the other two Services. I would ask the Minister to take a personal interest in how the process is handled.&nbsp; It is not only a question of sensitive management for those who are asked to leave, or are not re-engaged,&nbsp; often after many years of loyal service, but the effect on those who remain. We have in the past had redundancy schemes which, because of poor handling, have had a long term adverse effect on morale. A second aspect of the drawdown is ensuring that the phasing does not exacerbate the shortfalls in units, and compound the overstretch problem.&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>Policy</h3>
			<p>Finally, I would like to address the question of future Defence Policy. We are still equipping to meet the framework set out by the Strategic Defence Review of 1998, but have rebalanced the emphasis as described in the government's Delivering Security in a Changing World. Getting the balance right is extraordinarily difficult for any government, and no defence white paper that I am aware of in the last 25 years has ever stood the test of time. The Government is making long term plans for an uncertain future. Past experience suggests that we will always have to be flexible with our armed forces and use them with whatever capabilities they have to hand on the day. For this reason, it is vital not to be too prescriptive but look for general purpose capabilities. I am concerned that we may find ourselves in a futile chase to keep up with US approaches to warfare. The gracious speech looked for continued effectiveness of NATO: this will come from working with our EU partners to develop capabilities to contribute more effectively to global security needs.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>On this occasion, I have refrained from picking over the bones of the NAO concerns on Procurement cost overruns. Such rises in costs are endemic to the system. My real concern is that successive governments bail themselves out by cutting back on personnel. As the latest NAO report on urgent operational requirements for Iraq 2003 shows, we can get the equipment we need at relatively short notice. And I congratulate the MOD on how well it did. What we cannot do is whistle up new servicemen and women, whether they are helicopter pilots, sappers, sailors, or military doctors, in the short timescales available. If the armed services are provided for emergencies, they must have some slack in their establishments.</p>
			<p>Finally, My Lords, the gracious speech was strong on the threat to the UK from international terrorism. The Defence Select Committee drew attention in its 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp; Report in June to the MOD presumption that homeland security will be undertaken by whatever is not being used for other tasks.&nbsp; I tried, and failed, to get a specific duty in this respect to be put on the MOD in the Civil Contingencies Bill. The Defence Secretary has said that it would not be sensible to have &quot;highly trained extremely expert armed forces waiting for the threat to arrive in the United Kingdom&quot;. My Lords I believe that is exactly what we need. If there were to be a large scale terror attack in the UK, which perhaps involved CBRN agents, we would see a very marked reappraisal of where Defence priorities lay. Will the Government undertake to review the contribution that it requires of the armed forces in the&nbsp; direct defence of the UK?</p>
			<p>Providing security is about more than just defence policy. The balance between foreign policy, international development and defence is key, and I look forward to listening to other noble Lords views in these areas.</p>
