		<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The new year sees the UK Defence budget down
at some 2.4% of GDP, the lowest proportion since before World War 2.
The achievement of Geoff Hoon in fighting for a slight increase in
resources in real terms for the next three years only confirms that
the long term decline in share of GDP is set to continue. In parallel
with this decline in budgetary share goes a decline in overall
capability. Manpower costs rise broadly in line with general national
economic growth and military equipment costs rise much faster. From
time to time, successive governments reset the baseline for
commitments and capabilities through a defence review. The last one
undertaken by George Robertson in 1997/98 requires a defence
programme which is now no longer affordable. There will however be no
new review in an election year. The programme will be massaged by the
usual mix of measures which will exacerbate the frustration felt at
the frontline.</FONT></P>
		<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Against this depressing background, there
will be a number of problems for the staffs at the Ministry of
Defence in the coming twelve months. Bill Kincaid has dealt
separately in his article for The Source with the problems in the
defence procurement area. These will increase the funding pressures
in the rest of the defence area. The study into Defence Training and
Education, which Vice Admiral Jonathan Band has been leading for the
past year, is due to report soon. There are great hopes that
rationalising training will produce a few windfall savings, as well
as improving the effectiveness of military training.  Doubtless,
there will be some valuable real estate to be freed up, but this will
probably require some money up front for new facilities in new
locations. "Spend to Save" is a familiar cry around Whitehall, but is
not always received with sympathy by the Treasury. There may also be
some internal and external political difficulties with selling yet
more changes to armed forces, who see many parallels with the Grad
Old Duke of York. Nor does there seem any eagerness to finish off the
work on the privatisation of the majority of the Defence Evaluation
and Research Agency.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Keeping service personnel reasonably content
with their lot becomes ever more difficult. General Sir Charles
Guthrie, Chief of the Defence Staff, fired a few warning shots in his
Christmas lecture to the Royal United Services Institute. There are
shortages across the board in the Army, and empty cockpits in both
the RAF and the Royal Navy. Ministers will have to tackle the
difficult question of retention bonuses for key personnel. Yet the
award of bonuses to some may cause much heartache among those who are
excluded. The Royal Navy in particular prides itself on an all of one
company approach; yet an aircraft carrier without pilots will be
largely a waste of money.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The change in the US Administration will
affect British defence policy as well as foreign policy. Those in the
MOD, who are reluctant about the new ventures on European defence,
will find an opportunity to stir up concerns in the US. They will
also worry about the future of the US equipment programme. It may be
that investment in National Missile Defence and B2 bombers leaves the
Bush Pentagon unable and unwilling to continue with the Joint Strike
Fighter (JSF) programme. The difficulties over the British aircraft
carrier programme would be multiplied by a cancellation, or delaying,
of the JSF programme. There will also be concerns in the MOD over the
A400M strategic air transport programme. The RAF will be less worried
than others: it will hope to be able to build on its leased C17
capability which starts in May 2001. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">On  the operational side, the demands of
Northern Ireland, Bosnia, Kosovo, Sierra Leone, Iraq and the
Falklands do not seem likely to abate. The desire to see an EU
capability fielded as soon as possible will increase pressure for
more deployments. The worsening worldwide weather from climate change
will give rise to unpredictable humanitarian relief requirements. The
new arrangements for these with DFID in the lead will put more
pressure on MOD to act quickly. A worsening situation in and around
Israel may put demands on British forces in a number of different
roles.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">After a general election, even with a Labour
victory, the Defence Secretary and some of the junior Ministers can
expect to be shuffled. Already John Spellar is the only Minister left
from the Strategic Defence Review and from the Kosovo operation. The
political institutional memory in MOD is pretty short. It will be
unfortunate if the architects of the advances on European Defence
move on before the project is properly underway. A new ministerial
team will be looking for new initiatives, and the troops will find
themselves in turmoil again. Nor are the other political parties
promising extra resources for defence. Indeed the Conservative line
of balancing commitments with resources gets the hollow laugh around
the Services that it deserves. Graceful decline in military
capability is the best that can be expected in 2001. We must all hope
that events do not conspire to make it worse than that.</FONT></P>
