<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">Perspectives on Air Power - Air Power
in its Wider Context</FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">Edited by Stuart Peach, (The
Stationery Office, 1998), 365pp.</FONT></ADDRESS>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Group Captain Peach has produced an
excellent collection of essays on different aspects of air power. The
dozen authors are drawn almost equally from academia and the
military, but the quality and tone of the writing is remarkably
consistent across a very wide range of topics. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The first part of the book  deals with the
political context in which air power must operate today. Professor
Michael Clarke opens with a cogent analysis of the problems for UK
air power in the post Cold War world. He highlights the difficult
question of the relationship between European and American
capabilities. Few would argue with his belief that European air power
performs collectively less well than its inventory would suggest: "a
force that, even if operating as an alliance, would punch some way
below its weight". He begins to explore the implications of the
widening gap in technology across the Atlantic, but does not provide
a solution.  The other authors in this first section focus on the
political aspects of civil/military relations, coalition operations
and international law.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The second part of the book is about the
technological context. The four authors are either serving or retired
military officers who pack a great deal of information into their
chapters. The exciting examples of weapon systems, information
warfare and space are almost exclusively drawn from the United
States, and serve to reinforce  worries for the future of European
air power. Professor Tony Mason concludes that technological
superiority will continue to be needed by the Atlantic Community, but
gives little assurance to suggest that the European contribution will
be significant. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The final third of the book covers the
military context  with a look at joint operations, coercion and the
validity of strategic bombing.  Dr Philip Sabin develops  a useful
analysis into the factors which determine the optimum balance between
aerospace and surface assets in a particular joint campaign. Synergy
is not automatic, and forces need to be intelligently tailored if
they are to provide more than the sum of their parts. His warnings
need to be heeded by those that believe joint operations mean that
all three Services must always get a piece of the action.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In summary, this is a serious book which
presents its arguments in a very readable manner. Some of the charts
serve more to confuse than to enlighten, but  were doubtless more
useful as visual aids at the workshops which forged this volume. It
is essential reading for the military of any Service and for the
academic strategic analyst. It is realistic and so left this reviewer
uneasy about the continuing relative decline of European air
power.</FONT></P>
