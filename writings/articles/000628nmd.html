<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">We can all understand the immediate appeal
to both military and civilian of the thought that it might be
possible to provide defences against such an awful prospect as a
nuclear or other WMD attack. The US has a long and expensive history
of attempting to provide itself with defences against incoming
ballistic missile attack. The first attempts of the 60's were
abandoned when it became clear that such defences were technically
infeasible, and did no more than stimulate the Soviet Union to
increase the numbers of its nuclear tipped missiles. The possibility
of multiple warhead missiles made defences even less reliable and
reduced the stability of deterrence. In a wonderful moment of
rationality, the US and the Soviet Union agreed to the Anti-Ballistic
Missile (ABM) Treaty of 1972 which severely limited the defensive
system that each side could deploy. It was a treaty in which both
sides benefited from increased security and the world applauded the
reduced impetus for a nuclear arms race. As technology improved,
industry again offered a vision of providing leakproof missile
defences, and President Reagan held out the prospect in a speech in
1983. The Strategic Defence Initiative (SDI) spent billions of
dollars, but came no closer to providing a reliable defence against a
nuclear strikes.  When I was asked to join Hugh Beach on the recent
trip to Beijing, I went back to some articles I had written about SDI
in 1983 and '84 to see whether things had changed since then, and so
perhaps I could support the new proposals. My arguments against in
the early 80s had been on technical , strategic, military
effectiveness, financial and stability grounds.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The new proposals for NMD draw on the SDI 
technologies but look to a much more limited requirement. The threat
to the continental United States is assumed to come from a "rogue
state" (sorry now called states of concern). These are normally
thought to include North Korea, Iran or Iraq. Each is expected to
have very few missiles capable of carrying weapons of mass
destruction over intercontinental distances. The technical problems
of interception are therefore expected to be much less. There is a
strong political consensus among Democrats and Republicans that NMD
should go ahead if it is technically possible. The system testing so
far has been ambiguous, and the third key interception test has been
delayed. Nevertheless, President Clinton is expected to be in a
position to make a decision by July. He may decide that more tests
are needed and put off the final go ahead for NMD until his successor
is in post. So technical capability may be better than it was, but is
still uncertain. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The strategic implications are still much
the same as they were for SDI, despite the end of the Cold War and
the more limited declaratory aims. Many fear that undermining the ABM
treaty will unpick all the hard won achievements of arms control over
the past 30 years. It can be argued that if the US manages to
renegotiate the treaty with the Russians, there would be no such
problem. Unfortunately, the elements of the NMD system are not just
minor changes to the treaty. The thrust of the ABM treaty is to
prohibit a nation-wide defensive system. NMD also requires
treaty-banned space-based sensors and radars outside of the United
States. The obvious response for declared nuclear powers is to
increase the number of nuclear systems they field. For emerging
powers they may decide it is better to go less traditional routes
with their WMD delivery systems. None of this is helpful in promotion
confidence and safety. There are also worries about what the
deployment of such a system would mean for NATO. If the US had
provided for itself a shield which was not available to the rest of
NATO, would this affect the internal alliance relationships
adversely? Europeans do not share the US view of how to handle the
threat of proliferation in difficult states. Nor do they believe that
a missile defensive system protects against the many different types
of threat that are now emerging. In some respects the long range
missile threat is the least likely and nuclear deterrence remains a
sufficient strategy. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The costs of NMD remain very high, and will
undoubtedly drain defence resources from other more urgent needs. On
military effectiveness, it is difficult to imagine a level of
defensive assurance that will change the approach the US takes in its
dealing with difficult nations. From a military perspective, the loss
of money for other capabilities is likely to be the more important
aspect.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Finally a word about the particular policy
problem for the UK. Geoff Hoon has been recently reported as being
supportive of the US position. Fylingdales radar station and Menwith
Hill will both be integral parts of any US NMD system. The necessary
upgrades are likely to breach the ABM treaty unless it is
renegotiated. The UK has therefore some leverage with the US
government. However, it will not be enough to change the push towards
deploying an NMD capability. The UK may therefore feel that it can
help to broker the best modified ABM treaty that it can. This is not
a role which will make many friends in the rest of Europe. It will be
seen as another example of the UK being more with the US than with
Europe. From a domestic point of view, it may prove difficult to
explain why the UK is hosting two key parts of an American defensive
system, which provides no extra security to Britain. Indeed in any
future war, we might expect these facilities to be high priority for
attack.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">What should the rest of the world do? After
all, every American you talk with says that NMD is a done deal. No
politician would speak against it - any more than they would speak
against the death penalty. A move which is likely to result in a less
safe world in genral, and a less safe Britain in particular, for no
advantage is one in which Britain and Europe have a legitimate
interest. Perhaps there is now a Common Foreign and Security Policy
interest for Europe which is not shared by the United States, and
Europe needs to stand up for itself.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The best UK policy option may be to continue
arguing in public that there is no need to take a position until the
US makes a request about Fylingdales. In private, the UK government
should make it clear that it would not welcome such a request, and
that an affirmative answer could not be assumed.</FONT></P>
