<P>Five days into the air campaign, and the reality of war is with
us. However miraculous the technology, men and machines are at risk.
The loss of the stealth F117A over Serbia reminds us that once combat
is joined, we cannot be sure how it will run its course. The contrast
between the mediaeval slash and burn tactics of Serbian forces in
Kosovo and the high tech NATO air campaign could hardly be greater.
Yet, the measure of NATO's military success will be how effective air
strikes are in reducing the Serb violence against ethnic Albanians on
the ground. All military operations seek in the end to achieve a
political solution, but the current conflict requires great subtlety
in the application of air power if the aim is to be achieved. As NATO
announces its move into Phase Two, the destruction of the army and
police units in Kosovo, can air power deliver a solution?</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>We have grown used since the Gulf War to the extraordinary change
that precision weaponry has brought to the effectiveness of bombing.
A bombing aircraft will be travelling at 500 mph, flying 3 miles
above the ground, releasing its 1000 lb of high explosive into an
unpredictable air flow, while at the same time having to take
measures to avoid enemy air defences. Until the advent of smart
weapons, the accuracy of such tactics meant that repeated attacks
were needed to ensure the destruction of key targets. Now, the
planner can be assured that most weapons will be delivered to the
required point of impact. Fewer aircraft have to be risked to achieve
a desired level of destruction. But there are new factors in the
modern world which make the air planners' work more difficult. The
Kosovo operation was launched with the agreement of all 19 NATO
nations. Each member country is a democracy, with the need to carry
its public. In such a humanitarian relief operation, there will be
great sensitivity to losses of allied aircraft, as well as to
unintended civilian casualties on the ground. To these complications
the planner must ensure that each of the participating 13 different
air forces, with different aircraft and capabilities, has a role to
play.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Classical air doctrine always looks to gain control of the skies
as soon as possible. If enemy air defences can be neutralised, the
attacking aircraft have much more freedom to carry out their missions
in greater safety. The military need coincides with the political
requirement to prevent allied aircraft losses. On Wednesday, when
Operation Allied Force began, the now routine opening salvo of cruise
missiles was launched. These came from elderly American B52 bombers
that had taken off from England earlier in the day; from warships in
the Adriatic and from a submerged Royal Navy submarine. The missiles
are small jet aircraft that fly at low level using satellite
navigation, ground contour matching and optical image data to arrive
at their targets. They can be used to attack the key heavily defended
air defence elements of fixed radars, airfields, headquarters and
control centres. However, they are expensive and, unlike aircraft,
cannot be tasked for multiple missions.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The Yugoslav air defences are rightly taken seriously by planners.
In the jargon, they have an integrated air defence system: civil and
military radars are linked by fibre optic cables to control centres,
missile sites, fighter bases and aircraft. They will have ensured
that the system is connected so that they can sustain the loss of
some parts. They had a dozen of the Mig 29 Fulcrum modern Russian
fighters, but may have lost more than a third of these already. More
numerous are the 70 much less capable Mig 21 Fishbeds, which can be
systematically attacked on the ground. The real worry for the
planners is the mix of surface-to-air missiles. Some like the SA-2
are a very old design - this was the missile that brought down Gary
Powers in 1960. Others, like the SA-6, are mobile and effective at
the heights at which NATO aircraft are operating. Enormous effort is
devoted to electronic counter-measures, and each attacking aircraft
will be fitted with radar and infrared decoy systems. Yet there
remains the risk that a missile may get through to its target.
Anti-aircraft guns are limited in range and height, but can bring
down cruise missiles with a lucky shot. They become more important as
we move into Phase Two, when NATO aircraft will have to fly lower to
attack their targets.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>As the initial assault on all parts of the air defences nears
completion, the planners are giving greater priority to targets for
this next phase of the campaign. The Yugoslav army and the Ministry
of Interior police are the forces of repression in Kosovo. To curb
them from the air requires a number of different approaches. Coercion
may be achieved by systematic destruction of all the military
capability, but there is also a need to put the troops on the ground
in Kosovo on the defensive. If they need to disperse and protect
themselves, they may have less capacity to continue the ethnic
cleansing. The chain of command reaches from Belgrade through 3rd
Army HQ in Nis to the 52 (Pristina) Corps HQ, and then on down to the
units throughout Kosovo. The interior police are largely co-located
with the military. The army have relatively few infantry on the
ground, preferring to use tanks and artillery for their work. This
makes the work of NATO air power slightly easier. The headquarters,
the fuel and ammunition dumps, the communication centres and the tank
and vehicle parks will be high on the target list. Damaging the
logistic supply chain can bring a rapid degradation in capability.
Dispersal of important equipment will become a priority for units
under attack, and that will compound their communication problems.
Nevertheless, if these smaller targets are to be found and destroyed,
without risking civilian casualties, aircraft like the Harrier, the
A10 and perhaps even attack helicopters will need to fly at lower
levels than we have seen so far. This puts them at higher risk from
air defence guns, portable missiles and small arms fire.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The timing of the individual phases and the length of the air
campaign are subject to many factors, some political and some
military. For long term stability in Kosovo, an armed international
peacekeeping force will be needed. The phasing and intensity of the
attacks can be adjusted to encourage President Milosevic back to the
negotiating table. As we are seeing, an increase in atrocities in
Kosovo can be punished by an increase in the intensity of strikes,
while a reduction in Serbian forces in the region could be rewarded
by longer pauses between attacks. The military factors include, as in
all operations, the effects of weather. Some operations, particularly
if civilian casualties are to be minimised, require a clear view of
the target. Assessment of results can take some time, and may not
always be conclusive without a ground inspection. This means that
some targets may need to be attacked more than once to ensure that
they are destroyed. Balancing the military needs against the many
political imperatives, particularly when trying to keep all 19 NATO
nations aboard, will be hard as the campaign goes on. If Milosevic
remains intransigent, there will be no lack of targets for an air
campaign that runs into many weeks. But the political pressure to
ensure early results will also drive the timetable. While air
planners might have wanted to spend longer destroying the air defence
system, the quickening pace of events in Kosovo is perhaps pushing
them into an earlier move to Phase Two with added risks to aircraft
and aircrew.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Can this strategy work? Only time will tell. Nor should it be
forgotten that war is a two sided affair. The Yugoslavs may yet
decide to fight back against NATO forces in Macedonia, Bosnia, Italy
or even further afield. The small and ragged forces of the KLA in
Kosovo may try to capitalise on the cover that the NATO air campaign
will give them. They are however few in number, and are unlikely to
be a match for the mass of Serb forces on the ground. While NATO's
military can conduct an air campaign for as long as necessary, in the
end it is the political will which counts. The final stabilising of
the region will need an armed international ground force to be
present for a very long time. If it has to be put in place against
the wishes of the Serbs, NATO leaders will have some difficult
choices in the coming weeks.</P>
