<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">More reports criticising the poor
performance of the defence procurement process filled the Sunday
papers. The catalyst was two leaked post-Kosovo commanders' reports
on their problems in the field. The most publicised issues were those
of problems with communications and personal weapons. The media
quickly focused on the delays and cost rises that have been
associated with the introduction into service of the new
communications system for the army known as Bowman. The replacement
of the army's radios was first proposed in 1980, and yet the system
is unlikely to be in Service before 2003 and costs have escalated
considerably. If the current policy of Smart Procurement had been in
place would it have been a different story?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Let us assume that the new radios were given
priority in the 1981 defence programme, that there were no
technological glitches and that the procurement process was perfect.
Under such impossible circumstances, new radios should have been in
service within 4 years of the start date. That would mean that the
troops in Kosovo would have been operating with 1985 analogue radio
sets, which would already be 15 years old and likely to be suffering
as many problems as Clansman. The shaping assumptions for army
communications have been changing faster than any procurement process
can track. When the specifications were being formulated, the British
Army needed radios to operate within its 65km of the Inner German
Border over the flat German plain. In the post-Cold War era the
distances, the terrain and the nations involved have all changed. In
1985, perspex and chinagraph were used for plotting the battlespace.
In 2000, we need to transmit broadband digital data. The changes that
we have seen over this period in civilian mobile  and fixed
telecommunications give some idea of what would have been lost by a
design freeze in the 1980's.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">What then is the answer? Is the army to be
stuck with obsolete equipment because the procurement process can
never catch up? The only sensible answer is to move as far as
possible into the use of civilian equipment and devote fast track
procurement to the minimum necessary military add-ons. This will
probably be in the area of cryptography, although even that is
available commercially. Civilian equipment may not be as robust, but
perhaps the disposable mobile phone is a more appropriate piece of
kit than the everlasting, super-robust, military-spec, comms
centre.</FONT></P>
