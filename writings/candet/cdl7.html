<H2><CENTER>Indian Nuclear Strategy </CENTER></H2>

<P><CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER></P>

<P>India has a tradition of atomic energy research, which can rival
that of the other nuclear powers. Homi J. Bhabha, the father of the
Indian bomb, set up an institute of nuclear physics research in 1945.
Three years later, the Indian Atomic Energy Commission was set up;
but little was done until the formation of the Department of Atomic
Energy in 1954. The first research reactor, APSARA, went critical in
August 1956, and at the inauguration of the Atomic Energy
Establishment the following January, Nehru said: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>... No man can prophesy the future. But
I should like to say on behalf of my Government - and I think I can
say with some assurance on behalf of any future Government of India -
that whatever might happen, whatever the circumstances, we shall
never use this atomic energy for evil purposes. 1</I></P>

<P>Under Nehru a joint Canada-India reactor, CIRUS, was set up and
became operational in 1960. With a second research reactor in 1961
and a plutonium plant completed in 1964, the Indians had a sound base
for nuclear weapon production. Nehru's commitment for future
governments was somewhat modified by his successor, Shastri. In
November 1964, he told the Indian parliament that the policy was not
rigid, but 'I have no doubt that we cannot at the moment think in
terms of making atom bombs'.2 The reasons were more likely to be
economic than technical. Some observers 3 maintain that India could
have produced an atom bomb before China, had it wished so to do.

<P><CENTER>INDIA AND PROLIFERATION </CENTER></P>

<P>Indian public opinion was becoming more concerned about the
dangers of a world divided into the nuclear 'haves' and 'have-nots'.
The Sino-Indian conflict of 1962, the Chinese nuclear test in 1964,
and the war with Pakistan in 1965 produced a strong body of opinion
favouring nuclear weapons for India.4 Just a week after the first
Chinese test, the revered Bhabha broadcast on the subject of
disarmament. He maintained that the United Nations would need a
security force, armed with nuclear weapons, to police a disarmed
world. He made the point that 'One must remember that it is not any
object which is intrinsically good or bad, but the use which is made
of it'.S He went on to explain that the attraction of atomic
explosions for peaceful engineering purposes meant that the rapid
spread of nuclear weapons was likely. </P>

<P>India was a leading opponent of the Non-Proliferation Treaty
(NPT), which was viewed as a discriminatory arrangement, set up by
the nuclear weapon states for their own benefit. They identified
three major areas of unfairness. Firstly, the 'haves' would be free
to improve their nuclear arsenals, both in quantity and quality. The
'have-nots' would be prohibited from military research. Secondly, the
nuclear weapon states did not have to submit to safeguards, while the
others would have to submit even when engaging in peaceful nuclear
activities. Thirdly, all transfers of any nuclear technology were
subject to safeguards for the non-nuclear weapon states, while no
transfers of the nuclear weapon states were affected.6 The Indian
representative at the NPT talks in 1967 remarked that the institution
of such international controls was 'like an attempt to maintain law
and order in a society by placing all its law-abiding citizens in
custody, while leaving its law-breaking elements free to roam the
streets'.7</P>

<P><CENTER> THE PEACEFUL NUCLEAR EXPLOSION </CENTER></P>

<P>Even after India finally rejected the NPT in 1967, there was no
apparent urgency to complete the work on the atomic bomb. Indira
Gandhi maintained that the option for Peaceful Nuclear Explosions
(PNEs) was being retained. On 18 May 1974, an underground test
explosion of a Hiroshima-sized device was successfully carried out.
It was seen as a great boost to India's prestige. The stated purpose
of the test was to continue research into PNEs, and the Indian
literature of the time abounds with schemes for using PNEs in
engineering projects, such as making harbours, hollowing out gas
storage cavities, and extracting minerals and oil. All this despite
the declining interest in America and Russia, and the emerging world
scientific view that the disadvantages of nuclear explosives
outweighed the advantages.8 </P>

<P>There were other views as to the use of nuclear explosions.
Writing just before the test, the Director of the Indian Institute of
Defence Studies drew attention to the difference in treatment which
Washington gave to India and China. Quoting one of President Nixon's
aides as saying that 800 million Chinese armed with nuclear weapons
could not be ignored, he speculated that 600 million Indians
similarly armed might prompt a visit from a future American President
to New Delhi.9 Another commentator writing at the time of the test
was rather more specific about the role of the PNE: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>It cannot be denied that India's PNE
has military implications as well. It demonstrates India's
capabilities in the nuclear field and is a step in the direction of
establishing India as a centre of independent decision- making in the
world.10</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The reason that the Gandhi government decided to carry out the
test should give some indication of the Indian nuclear strategy. One
commentator 11 cites three different reasons for the decision: to
divert attention from the growing domestic problems; to force China
to become more accommodating; and as a signal to the superpowers that
India could not be taken for granted. The decision to conduct the
test must have been taken in late 1970 or early 1971.12 It is
difficult to point to any one of the three suggested reasons as being
of overwhelming significance at that time. Perhaps the decision was
more an acquiescence to the requests of the scientists, given a
feeling that there might be a measure of political kudos from a
successful test. </P>

<P>Canada suspended all nuclear aid following the test explosion, and
the United States took some mildly punitive action. Nevertheless, the
Gandhi government kept the option of further tests open. No further
tests were undertaken, and Prime Minister Desai has assumed a
Nehru-like view of nuclear weapons while in office. The Indian
External Affairs Minister stated at the United Nations on 30
September 1977 that, 'It is our solemn resolve that whatever the rest
of the world may do, we will never use atomic energy for military
purposes'.13 The following year, Desai went further and said, 'We do
not want to have any atomic weapons under any conditions, and do not
want even to have explosions of any kind'.l~ Even if these statements
were true, the return of Mrs Gandhi to power on 14 January 1980 made
them of little relevance. Since taking office, she has accelerated
India's military modernisation programme and a successful satellite
launch has been carried out.15 It would appear that the Gandhi
government intends to keep open its nuclear option. </P>

<P><CENTER>FUTURE TRENDS </CENTER></P>

<P>If India had been stockpiling nuclear weapons, it could have
produced some tens of weapons from the available plutonium. It has a
limited delivery capability with its Canberra bomber force, and
perhaps the recently acquired Jaguar aircraft. It is developing its
satellite and missile technology, but would require a considerable
investment of time and money to develop a force with the range and
numbers necessary to pose a deterrent threat to China. While it could
use its current potential nuclear force against Pakistan, it has no
need to. Nevertheless, the consensus view is that India is continuing
to keep the nuclear option open.16 This suggests that it has opted
for the 'insurance policy' approach to nuclear strategy. While
denouncing nuclear weapons, India is prepared to devote hard-pressed
resources to ensuring that it does not leave itself open to nuclear
blackmail in the future. </P>
