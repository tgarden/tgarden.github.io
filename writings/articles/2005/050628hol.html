			<p><i>Debate: Lord Judd-To ask HMG what progress they are making, together with other governments in the G8 and the EU, in the cause of defeating global terrorism</i></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>On a simplistic risk analysis, it would be possible to make the case that global terrorism is fairly low down the pecking order of international security threats. The numbers of deaths peaked&nbsp;&nbsp; in 2001. The risk of death to any individual from disease, natural disaster, or even road traffic accidents is much greater. Yet our government, and those of the US, the remainder of the EU, and the G8 are spending billions to counter this threat. In this priority of government spending, they have the broad support of their electorates. This is partially because of the particular fears stimulated by the random deaths from terrorism, but also because the growth of the suicide bomber has opened up the possibility of large scale murder with much greater difficulty in providing defensive measures, particularly if nuclear or biological weapons were involved. The threat does however remain much lower than that which we had through the Cold War from state owned wmd.</p>
			<p>My Lords, in contributing to this debate,&nbsp; I should start by saying that &quot;the cause of defeating global terrorism&quot; is likely to be a lost cause in this century. What we can do is look at ways to reduce risks from existing terrorists, reduce their number, and aim to eliminate the growth of&nbsp; recruits to extremist movements. This is not a defeatist approach, but a realistic one. It should shape our thinking in terms of where we put our effort&nbsp; nationally or through the G8, EU or UN between short term defences and long term cures.</p>
			<p>The Foreign Affairs Select Committee in the other place produced on 22 March 2005 a report entitled &quot;Foreign Policy Aspects of the War against Terrorism&quot;.&nbsp; I commend it to your Lordships as an excellent piece of analysis. They concluded that al Qaeda and associated groups continue to pose a serious threat to the UK and its interests.&nbsp; Other analysts are less alarmist. Paul R. Pillar former deputy chief of the CIA's Counter terrorist center, and now at the US National Intelligence Council has said:</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The disciplined, centralized organization that carried out the September 11 attacks is no more. Al Qaeda still has the capacity to inflict lethal&nbsp; damage, but the key challenges for current counterterrorism efforts are not as much Al Qaeda as what will follow Al Qaeda.&rdquo; In this respect a report by Professor Coolsaet of Ghent University is interesting when he says: &quot;Jihadi terrorism now basically</p>
			<p>is a cloak patched from different sources of local discontent, real and perceived, stitched together by a puritanical and radical interpretation of Islam, and thriving on an enabling global momentum. The root causes underlying this particular brand of terrorism are composed of</p>
			<p>one major global root cause and a multitude of local root causes.&quot; He sees the major global root cause as:&quot;an astonishing degree of solidarity amongst Muslim communities worldwide, build upon shared feelings of humiliation, bitterness and besiegement. &quot;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The Select committee highlighted the role that Iraq is playing as a training ground for the new generation of terrorists, just as Afghanistan has previously. It is therefore in those two countries that I think we need to examine our policies most carefully. Many of us warned of the possible destabilising consequences of an unnecessary intervention into Iraq, but it was done and we must now live with the consequences. However, we do need to ensure that our actions in post-intervention Iraq do not stoke up further the fires of extremism. Heavy handed peacekeeping may give short term military successes, but the families of the dead will be fertile grounds for new terrorist recruits. In this respect, I was sorry to see that UK aircraft appear to be operating with US aircraft in Fallujah style offensive operations near the Syrian border. Even if the intelligence were reliable, which one might doubt, there will be innocent deaths, and growing resentment. This is not the way to reduce the long term threat from terrorism.</p>
			<p>If Iraq is now the centre of our problems, we must look for a grand strategy &#150; not operate only at the military tactical level. This means a realistic approach to the political process, which is the key to stabilising the country. The drift and worsening insurgency since the elections of 30 January must be reversed. We must work with the UN, G8 and EU to have a coherent plan. The current strategy - to stay as long as the Iraqi government want - is not a plan. It looks as though they will need a 6 month delay in delivering the constitution, holding the referendum on it, and then finally the proper elections. By adopting such a timetable, we could also set milestones for a multinational force drawdown in parallel with Iraqis taking on their national responsibilities. We need an agreed plan or else we will eventually have to leave, and we will have a nest of terrorism to strike at all our interests for decades to come. As the Select Committee concludes: &quot;the counter-insurgency strategy has not succeeded. This may reflect an overriding focus on a military approach to the detriment of political engagement.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Nor have we made Afghanistan safe. While the work of the small NATO deployments in the reconstruction teams has been a good model, we need to be careful as we build up the military presence over the next year, that we do not repeat the mistakes of Iraq. Using air power to garner support from local populations is more about Chinooks and Hercules providing food and economic development than about Apaches and Harriers destroying suspect areas on the basis of unreliable intelligence.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>There are of course other regional priorities for political action to reduce the longer term threat from terrorism. The Middle East peace process is key. Pakistan, particularly with nuclear weapons, is a concern.&nbsp; Syria and Iran need careful engagement rather than isolation if we are not to generate new sources of extremism. The Select Committee looked closely at problems of the Maghreb, and the significance particularly of Algeria, Morocco and Libya to countering terrorism. I agree strongly with their conclusion that this emphasises the need for reform in the EU's policy towards the region, an overhaul of the Barcelona Process and full engagement with the Region.</p>
			<p>There were three other aspects of the Select Committee report which were important: the multilateral framework, the importance of human rights and the role of non-proliferation work. Lord Judd's motion rightly speaks of the G8 and EU, but the importance of the UN to the multilateral framework should not be forgotten. The lack of a secretariat for the UN Counter-Terrorism Committee has been a poor indication of commitment.</p>
			<p>Similarly, despite the EU action plan on Terrorism, under Mr de Vries, progress has been remarkably slow. EU members agreed in December last year:</p>
			<p>&ldquo; that in order to be effective in the long run the Union's response to terrorism must address the root causes of terrorism. Radicalisation and terrorist recruitment can be closely connected.&quot;</p>
			<p>The analysis&nbsp; is right; the strategy is right; but we must use our Presidency to put some urgency into this area.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Promotion of Human Rights has a key role in preventing support for terrorism increasing. Injustice, lack of dignity, abuse and torture by repressive regimes have always led to extremes of violence. In promoting democracy, the members of the G8 and EU must never sink to the moral norms of their terrorist enemy. Guantanamo Bay, Abu Graib, Bagram, and the many other interrogation and internment facilities, some outsourced to repressive governments, are not just a moral outrage, they are against all our interests in combating terrorism. Information gained by undue pressure and outright torture is unreliable, and&nbsp; recruits many more to the terror banner. We must stop it and bring back due process for suspects.</p>
			<p>Non-proliferation approaches have assumed much greater importance in the age of the suicide bomber. It is now more likely that a non-state actor will use a CBRN weapon to achieve their aim. The Cold War has left us with unwanted mountains of fissile material, and also biological and chemical weapon expertise.&nbsp; All the responsible nations of the world should be working together to deny access to these materials and manufacturing processes. In this respect the debacle of the NPT Review conference was also a failure in the counter terrorist strategy. I trust that the Government will be making this an important aspect of its G8 work.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>My Lords, I would like to draw my remarks to an end by questioning whether we nationally have the balance of our efforts correctly drawn. The MOD sees its role as tackling the threats at a distance. We and our allies can take a robust military approach when the action is thousands of miles away. I do not recall us contemplating the use of aircraft launched missiles on the Irish border for terrorist problems closer to home. Yet if we generate 5 new radical recruits for every mis-targeted bomb, then we will be storing yet more trouble for the future. The need for engagement and respect for all peoples is in our interests as well as theirs. Yet if this true in&nbsp; Iraq and Afghanistan, it is also true in Bradford and Bethnal. Each of the EU nations needs to be working hard to prevent its own minorities from becoming isolated and radicalised. Fallujah and Guantanamo radicalise young people in Iraq and Afghanistan. Discrimination and racism can do the same at home. We must take care, My Lords, that in legislating to protect against terrorism, we do not spawn more recruits to the cause by alienating and isolating our citizens.</p>
