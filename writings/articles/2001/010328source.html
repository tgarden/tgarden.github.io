			<h3>Defence Policy 2001</h3>
			<p><i>by Sir Timothy Garden</i></p>
		</div>
		<p>The Government has taken a new approach to the public presentation of its defence policy. &#147;Defence Policy 2001&#148; is a nine page overview of current MOD thinking on policy priorities. Strangely, it gives more information in its short text than was available in the last Defence White Paper of December 1999. The move to an annual performance report has allowed the quantitative achievements of the armed forces to be considered separately. The new document confines itself to policy developments given changes to the strategic context since the last White Paper, and begins with a summary of the recent strategic context discussion paper which the MOD published in February.<br>
			<br>
			They assume that operational tasks are likely to remain as demanding as present. Environmental, demographic, economic and social changes will increase the pressures. The lack of a direct external threat to the UK for the foreseeable future remains a basic planning assumption. Interestingly,this is somewhat in contrast to the view that the United States is now taking of the world. NATO and the UK nuclear deterrent  are seen as remaining important to deter the emergence of such threats. Warfighting capabilities are also seen as vital given the possibility for high intensity conflicts arising in more distant theatres or through peace support operations.<br>
			<br>
			Europe now takes a much higher place in the thinking of the policymakers of MOD. The Strategic defence review (SDR) of 1998 pre-dated St Malo and all the work on developing European capabilities which has followed. The published SDR in retrospect looks remarkably light on the European dimension. Although the 1999 White Paper dedicated a chapter to &#147;NATO and European Defence&#148;, this did little more than report the Helsinki summit conclusions. Now we have national and European security as the policy priorities. Wisely the Government looks to NATO and the defence dimension of the EU to be mutually reinforcing. Despite much of the media and transatlantic comment about EU defence proposals undermining NATO, the UK Government approach seems both sensible and necessary. <br>
			<br>
			However, the Defence Policy 2001 paper does not take us much further forward in terms of European capabilities and contributions. The aim of meeting the Helsinki Headline Goal by 2003 is repeated, and with it the need to get the EU institutions functioning and working with NATO. However 2003 is hardly a long term perspective. The strategic context looks out over 30 years: the policy implementation seems to end in 2 years&#146; time. <br>
			<br>
			The key element that is missing from the document is any discussion about resources for funding defence policy. The authors identify not just European security needs, but UK priorities in North Africa, the Middle East and the Gulf. They conclude that the SDR conclusions on the shape of British forces is broadly confirmed, but that some aspects need to be refined as a result of operational experience. We also need to  strengthen a number of enabling capabilities such as command&amp; control and logistics. <br>
			<br>
			We have therefore a defence policy that sees the operational tempo as continuing at its high level, and also expects new requirements for Europe and in the light of Kosovo. Yet the MOD is in significant difficulty with both manpower and financial resources at present. The &#147;generous&#148; public spending settlement which has kept funding virtually level in real terms will not pay for the missing manpower, the rising equipment costs and the remedial action needed. None of this is addressed in an otherwise very sensible document. It is of course always difficult to publish an official document that says its policy is unaffordable. If the Government is serious about providing these sorts of capability as part of a contribution to European security, it is going to have to do much more with our European partners. The policy for beyond 2003 needs some urgent thought.<br>
