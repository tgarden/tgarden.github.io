<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Introduction</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"> Our security throughout Europe in the
traditional sense is now greater than at any time this century.We
should feel this particularly in the UK Of course security is a much
wider issue than just assessment of threats to territory,we may feel
increasing concerns about environmental problems or crime or disease,
but my focus will be on the traditional foreign policy security
concerns. We continue to provide money, people and equipment for our
armed forces, and we do that for a number of reasons.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">I do not need to explore fictional scenarios
of future threats to Europe to justify our military provisions. The
evidence of need in the post Cold War world is already with us. I
will talk about what we have learned of our security needs over the
last ten years, how constrained we are in what we can do, and then
argue that Europe could and should do much better in future.</FONT>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Lessons of the 90's</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"> 	The end of the Cold War  left  Europe 
with a vast and expensive set of military forces, which had been
practising to fight a single campaign for over 40 years. For Western
Europe, the planning assumptions for an all out war in Europe were
relatively simple. The enemy was well defined and consisted of the
aggregate forces of the  Warsaw Pact. The exact locations, strengths
of forces, tactics to be used and phases of the war were studied by
generations of soldiers. The fall of the Berlin Wall, the unification
of Germany, the demise of the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union, all
changed the strategic landscape in Europe in little more than a 3
year period.  NATO's purpose was suddenly in question as nations
scrambled to cash in on the peace dividend. Yet in the event, the
decade of the 90's has seen more diverse military action by the
Western nations, under various banners, than at any time previously. 
Kuwait, Iraq, Somalia, Rwanda, Bosnia, Haiti, Albania, Kosovo and now
East Timor have seen western military force deployed to less than
benign environments. A new doctrine for peace support operations has
replaced the manuals on flexible response in the military staff
colleges of the Alliance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	This series of military and diplomatic
adventures is sufficient now to have established a strong consensus
on the new rationale for NATO, which was articulated in the Strategic
Concept launched at the NATO summit in Washington in April 1999. The
ever increasing data from real operations, rather than deterrence
postures, has also highlighted the major shortcomings in the security
capabilities available to the Alliance for these new tasks. The Gulf
War, while not a NATO operation, was conducted by an ad hoc coalition
drawn for the most part from NATO members. It was conducted using
NATO procedures with forces drawn from NATO formations.  It was a
relatively clear cut case for the international community to react to
aggression, and thus an almost ideal trial for the concept of
enforcing international law. Iraq had clearly broken international
law by invading Kuwait, and the UN could authorise military action to
expel the invaders. Iraq had few friends among its neighbours; had an
oppressive regime with potentially dissident  groups; and  was 
remote to US and European publics. The US led coalition was able to
take its time in building up military presence in the surrounding
area. The then novel doctrine of a prolonged air campaign was tested
successfully.  Lack of casualties to the allies made the 6 weeks of
offensive air action acceptable to politicians and public. The early
losses of UK Tornados had caused great concern, and it became clear
to the military commanders that safety was to take priority over
short term effectiveness.  The much greater availability of precision
guidance for bombs had also set a precedent in terms of what was
acceptable collateral damage in this type of operation. The 4 days of
ground war reinforced this new vision of  war: ground forces sent in
only when it was safe to secure the victory that had been won 
relatively bloodlessly from the air. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The key lesson from the Gulf  War was that
the US was both quantitatively and qualitatively in a different 
capability league from all the other nations involved. As the French
discovered to their annoyance, if you could not operate to US/NATO
procedures, then you were kept out of the action. In the air, it was
a war of offensive air operations, and these had to be conducted from
medium to high altitudes. Air defence fighters had little work to do.
The European nations had invested heavily in  fighters to protect
themselves from the long range Russian bombers of the Cold War. They
had depended on low flying tactics to improve their survivability
against Warsaw Pact air defence systems, while accepting that there
would be a significant attrition rate. In a war that was expected to
last only 5 days before going nuclear, training and equipment were
posited on achieving rapid results. Somalia reinforced the perception
internationally that the US was only prepared to remain engaged if
their troops were kept safe. The predominance of airpower solutions
to international crises was underlined by the continuing air
operations over both Northern and Southern Iraq. Operation Provide
Comfort had successfully, through air operations, rescued the
displaced Kurds who had fled from their homes in Northern Iraq. It
was less clear that the results for the Marsh Arabs in the South were
as positive. While there was a need for some fighter capability to
police the air exclusion zones, it could be carried out as the
secondary role of either bomber or reconnaissance aircraft. </FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The sequence of events in Bosnia
reinforced within the US the view that offensive airpower could
provide the necessary coercion to bring recalcitrant leaders to the
negotiating table. That the history of the region up to the Dayton
accord is considerably more complex is unimportant. There is a
widespread perception among  American decision makers that the threat
and application of air strikes was critical to obtaining Milosevic's
agreement to the Dayton proposals. Again, in this short air campaign,
the world expected precision attacks with no collateral damage and no
losses to our own side. When an airman was lost over hostile
territory, combat search and rescue effort became the over-riding
priority. There were less intense military adventures. Operation
Alba, the response to the breakdown of law and order in Albania,
showed that there were crises which required a European coalition of
the willing response. In this case, it was clear that the mechanisms
for putting together such a coalition were imperfect, and that it was
only possible because of  the relatively benign environment.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The 1999 Kosovo air campaign brought
together all the political and military lessons that had been learned
in the post Cold War operations. The US had expended a good deal of
research on improving its precision weapons. Nevertheless, the use of
laser designation remained a significant constraint if the target was
obscured by weather. The two other precision systems (GPS navigation
and TERCOM ground mapping) were available both in bombs and cruise
missiles, but were significantly more expensive and limited to fixed
targets. Nevertheless, this mix of weaponry allowed the campaign to
be planned on a requirement for no casualties to NATO forces, and
minimal collateral damage. These constraints undoubtedly prolonged
the air campaign, but given that the required outcome was ultimately
achieved, we can expect future operations to have similar assumptions
about casualties.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	 The contributions from the European  NATO
nations which took part were varied, but all were overshadowed by the
US. For example, the UK carried out only 4.3% of the total sorties
flown. Some of these were the Sea Harriers doing little more than
defending the small  anti-submarine warfare carrier that they are
deployed on. Others were air-to-air refuelling aircraft aircraft 
supporting the Tornados that operated from their bases in Germany. 
The sorties which mattered were those carrying out offensive attacks,
and here the total UK effort is  nearer 10%, and we know that in many
of these cases it was not possible to release weapons, so that the UK
effort in terms of munitions released was only 4.2%. The story is
similar for the other non-US NATO air forces including Germany.
Europe was shown to be good at providing political support for the
operation, but incompetent at contributing to the air campaign in a
significant way. The difficulties in raising ground force numbers,
even for an operation in a relatively  benign environment, suggested
that the armies of  Europe were as badly structured as those of the
air forces. On the naval side, the last ten years has shown that,
with the exception of US major aircraft carriers and cruise missile
platforms, there is also a limited need for Cold War maritime
military assets. </FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Europe as a Strategic Power		</FONT>
</H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Does any of this matter? It is sometimes
argued that there is no need to change the current arrangements for
security within Europe. NATO served the continent well throughout the
Cold War, and has reinvented itself to adapt to the security needs of
the post Cold War era. Indeed the enlargement of NATO, the new
strategic concept and the recognition of the needs of a European
Defence and Security Identity within NATO are all a part of a new
security structure for Europe. The question is whether this process
of development within the NATO structure is sufficient for the
future. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Europe is an economic power, but it is a
long way from being a strategic power. To be a strategic power
requires two key elements: a clear and coherent foreign policy, and
the diplomatic and military means to implement that foreign policy.
Europe currently has neither. For the 21st Century, it seems
inconceivable that a region which is as rich and populous as the
United States can expect to continue its foreign and security policy
on either an exclusively  national basis or only through NATO. As we
have seen from Bosnia and Kosovo, Europe must shape its security
strategy  always mindful of how it will play in the US Congress.
Looking to the longer term, NATO remains important (and more secure
after Kosovo), but there is no guarantee that it will remain in
existence for ever. Had the Kosovo operation ended in failure, the
future utility of NATO would have been very much in doubt. There will
doubtless be other tests of Alliance cohesion in the years
ahead.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Improving  European Capability</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The question  is how  to develop a
European Foreign and Security Policy which is underpinned by the
necessary diplomatic and military capability to implement it. We need
a design which maintains and supports NATO but gives us a European
capability to protect and promote European vital interests. The
arguments too often revolve around the institutional debates. The
linkages between NATO, WEU, and the EU, coupled with debates over
second and fourth pillars, do little to advance the military
capability available to Europe. The institutional framework is
important but it is nothing without the military and diplomatic
capability to underpin it. Too often the institutional debate
revolves around how to give Europe a greater voice in the deployment
of US assets. What needs to be addressed is how to provide more
European useful capability, and then how it should be organised in
both a NATO and an EU context.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">		The EU and the US have GDPs of almost
exactly the same size. Yet EU nations spend only just over half as
much on defence, and then share these smaller resources over twice as
many troops.   Hopes for fixing the problems of European defence
capability currently centre on each nation modernising their military
on a national basis. Each nation is expected to transform its forces
into rapidly deployable smaller more flexible units tailored to peace
enforcement. While this would certainly offer some extra resources
for the types of operation which are currently being undertaken, it
would not greatly improve the total defence capability that Europe
obtains for its vast expenditure of defence.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Ideally the development of the common
defence policy for the European Union, like the United Kingdom's
recent strategic defence review, should be foreign policy led. The
scale and the scope of the armed forces would be determined by the
objectives of foreign policy developed within the CFSP, while
ensuring that  members of the North Atlantic Alliance could meet
their NATO obligations.  The arrival of former Secretary General of
NATO, Javier Solana, as the High Representative for Foreign and
Security Policy in the EU  will make this easier.This would not lead
to any decoupling of European countries from their NATO undertakings.
 Nor should there be any duplication of the critical contribution to
military co-operation provided by NATO, namely its command structures
and headquarters, although certain developments of double-hatting
could take place.  The most effective way for the members of the
European Union to get more deployable forces for a euro is by
systematically developing economies of scales in the support,
training and operational management of their armed forces. </FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">On the political side progress has been
made, particularly through the changes in the UK stance since St Malo
in December 1998 and the work done subsequently culminating in
Helsinki in December 1999. Unfortunately, the politicians have gone
for the big publicity item of a deployable European force of 60,000
which can be sustained for 12 months with air and naval support. This
is unlikely to make any hgreat improvement to the total of European
military effectiveness, and will certainly give many nations an
excuse to reduce their capability yet further.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Current Examples of Integration</FONT>
</H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	There are two approaches whereby
duplication between European armed forces could be eliminated  and
additional resources  made available for increased force
effectiveness.  One would be in the development of new common
capabilities, and the other is the development of pooled support and
logistic services.  An existing Alliance example of the first
approach is the common procurement and operation by fourteen allies
of the AWACS (airborne early warning and control) aircraft.  An
example of the second approach is the way that four Nordic countries
providing troops to IFOR/SFOR are supported by a common logistic
battalion.  The agreement by the Netherlands and Belgian navies to
develop common headquarters and support services for their fleets is
a hopeful sign that some European states have made a start to the
elimination of expensive duplication. Already this approach is
allowing greater military capability to be deployed. While the Dutch
and the Belgian planners would individually be reluctant to offer an
unlimited deployment of a frigate for operations, they can now
arrange to share a task with a roulement of forces between
themselves. The management of the force from a shared headquarters
results in a greater military capability at no extra cost.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The inefficiencies of the national
approach to defence within European states is widely recognised. Some
argue that the most effective way to tackle it is through common
procurement and perhaps greater integration of European defence
industries. Attempts at both elements have not always been successful
in the past. Recent experience in procurement of an Anglo-French
frigate shows how difficult it is to see such projects through
successfully. Moreover, the defence industries are reluctant to be
integrated by European fiat. They look to partnerships which improve
their shareholder value. This may in any case be a better approach as
it is likely to improve competition and hence value for money.
Nevertheless, there will be opportunities for sensible common
procurement where there is a widely shared common requirement, and it
makes sense to try to exploit these where it can reduce procurement
costs.  These opportunities will arise more often if nations move
towards a pooling of  military resources.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Early Opportunities for Initiatives</FONT>
</H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	An immediate opportunity to explore common
procurement is the Medium Scale Transport Aircraft, for which common
tenders are being sought by seven European countries. There is also a
need for large strategic air lift capability which could be
approached jointly. These are two examples where after common
procurement, common operation could be considered. If operated as a
European force, a reduction in the number of operating bases required
would lead to much greater cost effectiveness.  These could become
early examples of European Force Elements.  The development of a
common European flight refuelling service could also be examined.  In
the longer term the common support and servicing of helicopters could
make sense. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Eurofighter, already ordered by five
countries, could provide a trial for a number of these concepts.  If
Europe moved towards the American large airbase concept, we might
perhaps  imagine an operationally ready force of some 400
Eurofighters made up of 20 multinational squadrons distributed over
as few as five airbases.  In addition an operational training base on
a sixth airfield would be required.  The training base could also
provide a home for the European Union Eurofighter HQ. The operating
costs would be much less than the planned national arrangements, even
if the traditionally smaller European airbases were retained.   The
key to success would be the application of common training,
procedures and aircraft modification programmes.  By making each unit
truly multinational and by developing the overall common operational
policy through the EU HQ, the problems of  national divergence could
be eliminated.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	In the marine environment, one can
cumulate existing capacities and provide common supply services,
possibly leading to a rationalisation of the number of European naval
bases.  Fleet auxiliaries can be envisaged as developing a common
European service.  An early candidate as one of the European Force
Elements, would be a European mine counter measure service. The
principle could be applied to larger ships.  France, Italy, Spain and
the United Kingdom all wish to have some aircraft carrier capability;
could it be provided by a common squadron thereby providing savings
in support and logistic chains, while also ensuring that a viable
force was available at all times?  A European led Combined Joint Task
Force in the maritime environment at present lacks a satisfactory
headquarters ship; one, or more, of these could be acquired on a
common basis.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	It would make sense to begin the approach
to land forces by looking at engineers, communications, transport and
medical services, which could provide the first common programmes. 
The wider field of logistic support could follow and an early
candidate would be the development of common IT systems for
logistics.  The question of outsourcing logistic and support services
is now under active consideration in a number of European countries. 
There would be economies through the  working out of common
specifications and the use of a limited number of common suppliers. 
Success in these areas would enable a subsequent application of the
approach of European Force Elements to artillery, armour and infantry
units.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	There are some force elements which are
provided jointly to&nbsp;all armed services.  Some of these, like
protection against nuclear, biological and chemical warfare, are
obvious candidates for common provision.  Others, such as
intelligence and mapping, are more difficult because of traditional
transatlantic patterns of co-operation, but it would be a mistake for
the development of a separable NATO for any capability to depend on a
single ally, even the United States.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Finally, the deployable headquarters of
the ARRC has proved its worth many times over in Bosnia and Kosovo.
We need more such rapidly deployable HQ, and there would be sense in
making the next one an EU project. The EuroCorps would be a suitable
formation to base this upon.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Need for a European Defence
Budget</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	These examples suggest some practical
areas where the development of European Force Elements and common
support and logistic services could provide building blocks for the
strengthening of European defence capabilities. They would make more
effective use of European defence budgets through the removal of the
cost overhang of separate support systems. Valuable as such
individual initiatives would be, they would not by themselves
represent a coherent new security structure for  Europe. They would
however illustrate how significant improvements in effectiveness
could be achieved through merging particular national capabilities
and sharing common services.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	For this approach to become coherent, it
would be necessary to develop a planning and budgetary system at the
European level. The ultimate requirement would be for a European
Defence Budget. Under such a system EU members would provide either
defence capability or money as their contribution. This would have a
number of beneficial effects: not only would the free ride be
stopped, but nations would probably prefer to improve their military
capabilities rather than to contribute money to the employment and
industries of other nations. A virtuous circle of improved military
capability and effective European defence could be established. There
would be many problems in assessing the true worth of each
contribution, but the process would also make the planning and audit
at the European level more effective.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Long Term European Goal</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	These suggestions do not move into the
much more sensitive area of national allegiances.  Servicemen and
women would still be recruited, given basic training, and paid by
national governments to whom their basic loyalty would remain.  In
any event those nations with defence commitments beyond NATO, such as
France and the United Kingdom, would continue to maintain the
necessary independent capability in some areas despite the additional
costs.  For others the opportunity costs of continuing a policy of
conscription will need to be addressed.  The issues in these areas,
which would take a common defence policy even further, may have to be
addressed at some stage but are not on the immediate agenda.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The long term goal might be a true
European Defence Capability which would make for an equal partnership
with the United States within NATO. Even if such a regional approach
proves too difficult politically, the implementation of some sensible
measures of closer integration of particular capabilities could
provide more effective forces at no greater cost. The institutional
structures to support such an approach would develop in parallel
through the EU High Representative for Common Foreign and Security
Policy. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Europe needs to grow up and accept the
international security obligations that go with its stature as an
regional economic power with global interests. It has the necessary
structures, it has the necessary resources, but it is still less than
clear that it has the political will.</FONT></P>
