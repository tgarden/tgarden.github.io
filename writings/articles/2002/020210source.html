			<h3>Axis of Evil</h3>
			<p>by Sir Timothy Garden</p>
		</div>
		<div align="left">
			<p>Just as Ronald Reagan is remembered for  his rhetoric over the Soviet Union as an &quot;Evil Empire&quot;, so George W.Bush is likely to claim the  phrase &quot;Axis of Evil&quot; in the history books.  When Reagan was rallying the West to spend more on defence, and trying to sell missile defences (Star Wars) to his electorate, the rhetoric caused only a few ripples. NATO was generally pointing in the same direction, and the common enemy was the Soviet Union. <br>
				<br>
				Times have changed. There is no single foe for NATO to fear. The terrorist attacks on the USA last September have generated a reasonably coherent international response, but most of the world does not view terrorism as the same single problem that the USSR was. <br>
				<br>
				The phrase &quot;Axis of Evil&quot; is a curious one, particularly when it is defined as North Korea, Iran and Iraq. It cannot mean axis in the geometrical sense, and so it must be more in the sense of an unholy alliance of states. Yet the differences between the three states far exceed any commonality. They have of course headed the list of  US designated rogue states for several years, and each has been the scene of unresolved conflict with America in the past.  Each is known to have been trying to develop weapons of mass destruction, and it is feared that they help international proliferation and terrorism. However if these were the critical criteria then Pakistan, Libya, China, India, Saudi Arabia, Israel and Egypt might find themselves as potential candidates for pariah status.<br>
				<br>
				Do the three states have some new qualification in the light of the 11 September attacks? It seems unlikely that any of them have close links with al-Qaeda. North Korea is an atheistic Communist state. Iraq is a secular state which has little love for the Saudi brand of fundamental Islam which appears to be the basis for al-Qaeda. Iran has interests in Afghanistan, but was strongly anti-Taleban. If the axis were drawn from the states which spawned al-Qaeda then Saudi Arabia and Pakistan would appear to be stronger candidates.<br>
				<br>
				Have these three countries been chosen because they represent an urgent threat to the West in general and the USA in particular? If this were so, they might replace the Soviet Union of the 1980s as the feared enemy. None of them has the ability now to strike beyond their immediate neighbourhood. Each is developing longer range missiles, and the munitions to cause mass destruction. But the threat is some time away.<br>
				<br>
				 For North Korea, the economy is near collapse and it is internationally isolated. It might , in a move of desperation, deliver a nuclear weapon to South Korea or Japan. It knows that this would lead to devastating retaliation. Reunification of the two Koreas is the most likely future for the peninsular, and the discussions of a year ago seemed to be moving that agenda forward.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				Iraq continues to be a danger to its neighbours. The UN inspection teams discovered ample evidence of an enormous programme to produce a usable nuclear, biological and chemical weapon capability. Since the teams have been thrown out, Saddam Hussein has presumably been continuing the weapons program. He has had rather less co-operation from the rest of the world, and he has also been subject to continual aerial harassment by US and UK air forces. Nevertheless, there is a real possibility of Iraq gaining a serious capability for delivery of weapons of mass destruction to its neighbours in a relatively short timescale.<br>
				<br>
				The position of Iran is much less clear. Given the threats that they face from their neighbours including Iraq, Israel, and Saudi Arabia, it would be surprising if they were not seeking their own deterrent capability. They have also given direct support to the anti-Israeli terrorist organisations.<br>
				<br>
				The real question is whether Bush's declaration of a new category for these three states means that he intends to launch a military campaign against them, and what would the consequences be? In each case, there is no way of predicting what would happen. North Korea might be expected to take the national suicide route by launching an attack on South Korea. Years of painstaking work would disappear with unknown consequences. Iran under threat might manage to come to an accommodation with Iraq and be prepared to launch a joint attack on Israel. If this were not possible, it would certainly seek to undermine the stability of the fragile Afghanistan. It would also feel free to launch international terror attacks in retaliation. Finally, a major attack by the US on Iraq would prompt attacks on Jordan and Israel. Even if the Saddam Hussein government were displaced, the country would probably split into 3 parts, and this would exacerbate the Kurdish nationalist problem in the region.</p>
			<p><br>
				It is difficult to see how military action in any of these three states will help reduce the threat from terrorism. Indeed the resulting conflicts in the region will make the problem many times worse. If the rise in US defence spending were used in a more targeted way for regional development, it might be possible to reduce the threats.<br>
				<br>
				 For Tony Blair there is a real policy problem. Can he continue to give uncritical support to the USA as it moves into the next phase? To many in Europe, the axis of evil seems more about settling old scores and placating the American defence industry and pro-Israeli lobbies than sensisble strategic thinking.<br>
