<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Mining and the environment</H1>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>Mining is mainly conducted by open pit or underground
methods. The nature (shape, size, depth and grade) of the orebody
determines the appropriate method but environmental factors are also
considered. The impact is minimised by mine planning, dust and noise
control, safe solid waste disposal, water capture and treatment,
progressive rehabilitation and post mining land use planning.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>RTZ-CRA requires all operations and activities to be
managed with proper concern and regard for the environment, the
health and safety of employees and the local community.</P>

<H1>Mining</H1>

<H3>Transport and storage of materials</H3>

<P>Ore is moved from mine to crusher and stockpiles, then processing
plant, by haul truck or conveyor. Concentrate is often transported by
road or rail for smelting elsewhere. The impact from dust, noise and
vibration arising is minimised on private or public property, and
fuel and energy efficiency optimised. Explosives and process
chemicals are securely stored and their use audited. Emergency
response and clean up facilities are maintained at all times. <TABLE

<H3>Ore processing and metal recovery</H3>

<P>The ore is crushed and finely ground in mills, then treated to
separate the valuable minerals from associated waste material. Noise
and dust are minimised by appropriate techniques of dust capture and
suppression. Final separation to produce the metal in concentrate
form is achieved by flotation, gravitational or magnetic methods, or
chemical leaching.</P>

<P>Liquid and solid effluent (tailings) from the process are treated
to remove residual process chemicals and then contained in a storage
pond (tailings dam) to settle out the solids. Wherever possible,
water is recycled back to the plant. Any discharge to surface water
is licensed, and monitored, as is groundwater quality.</P>

<P>If smelting is undertaken on site, in-plant health and safet)i and
external emissions are carefully controlled and monitored. Special
precautions are taken if the ore and products are radioactive.</P>

<H3>Waste disposal</H3>

<P>All waste is minimised at every stage by efficient mine planning
and processing, and its safe disposal designed to maintain
environmental appearance and quality. The solids are waste rock, sub
economic ore, which may have future value, and tailings. Stable waste
rock dumps are designed to minimise landscape impact and to
facilitate revegetation. Sub economic ore is stored with facilities
for capturing, treating and recycling water run off and leachate to
prevent contamination. Soil and overburden (cover material), is
stored for use in rehabilitation and to minimise leaching. Tailings
dams are designed to provide safe long term storage and, once
stabilised, are often revegetated.</P>

<H3>Environmental management</H3>

<P>RTZ-CRA's policy is to strive for excellence in managing its
environmental responsibilities. Through effective management
practices, the Group aims to minimise adverse impacts its activities
may have on the physical environment and to make a positive
contribution to local community life.</P>

<P>RTZ-CRA has a Health, Safety and Environment Policy which applies
to all subsidiary companies throughout the world. This policy
requires operations to:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>use regulatory compliance standards as a foundation for
   environmental management;
   
   <LI>seek ongoing improvement in environmental practices and
   procedures to meet future environmental requirements and
   expectations;
   
   <LI>ensure efficient use of energy, water and other materials and
   effective pollution prevention programmes;
   
   <LI>undertake environmental audits and report regularly to their
   boards of directors on environmental performance; and
   
   <LI>plan for eventual closure which includes management of
   environmental impacts.
</UL>

<H3>Environmental monitoring</H3>

<P>Commitment to high standards of environmental management involves
impact assessment, monitoring and auditing. Impact assessments are
carried out for any major proposed capital development, closure or
acquisition. Monitoring ensures continuous assessment of performance,
identifies potential problems and assures communities that an
operation is safe. Auditing gives a periodic review of the
environmental, health and safety status of an operation.</P>

<P>Air and water samplers and dust deposition gauges measure
discharge to atmosphere and water. The health of neighbouring plant
and animal communities (including livestock) is also monitored.
Performance is measured by comparing results with the conditions
prior to mining and impact assessment predictions. This shows where
changes could be made and enables investment decisions to be taken to
maintain standards of environmental control and meet changing
legislation.</P>

<H3>Rehabilitation</H3>

<P><IMG SRC="envrbm.gif" WIDTH=113 HEIGHT=93 X-SAS-UseImageWidth
X-SAS-UseImageHeight BORDER=3 ALIGN=bottom>Rehabilitation stabilises
land against erosion and makes it available for re-use. The nature
and timing of rehabilitation depends on the type of operation but
requires a planned programme covering all stages of a mine's life.
High standards of environmental control during mine life makes
eventual shut down easier and more cost effective. With most large
scale open pits infilling is impractical, so when mining stops they
are stabilised, revegetated and made safe. However, inactive tailings
and waste rock dumps may be revegetated during operations. Other
surface methods such as strip mining enable the land to be restored
as mining progresses.</P>

<P>Revegetation involves the reconstruction of an original or
replacement ecosystem. Where topsoil and overburden has been
stockpiled rehabilitation to high standards is possible but otherwise
revegetation is carried out directly onto contoured waste rock or
tailings using special planting and management techniques.
Revegetation programmes are based on trials which examine suitable
local plant species and substrate.</P>

<P>Mines have finite lives and all RTZ-CRA companies maintain and
update closure plans, which describe measures for closure, and make
financial provision for estimated closure costs. Plans are site
specific but have common features: equipment and infrastructure are
re-used or remove; all shafts and access points are sealed and made
safe; open pits are stabilised and fenced as necessary; materials and
chemicals are carefullv disposed of; civil engineering works
undertaken and rehabilitation of waste material completed.</P>

<P>Research and practical engineering have produced successfull
rehabilitation programmes to rebuild landscapes and ecosystems on
mine waste and tailings.</P>

<P>By careful planning mine-closure can be achieved with reduced
landscape disfigurement making the land available for re-use.<HR>
