<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Since man discovered how to harden steel, the modification of the
molecular structure of materials has had an impact on military
effectiveness. Today, the nature of materials affects the lethality
of weapons, the survivability of troops, the performance of aircraft,
the costs of production of new systems and every aspect of every
component of defence equipment. The scandal of the aircraft
coffee-maker which was designed to withstand much greater 'g' forces
than the aircraft which carried it is an indication of the
pervasiveness of materials technology in every aspect of military
hardware.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In the search for ever greater effectiveness from weapons, the
designer can look for new materials which offer benefits over the old
in capability, ease of manufacture, or lower cost. New materials may
offer weapon designs that were previously impossible. The use of
carbon-fibre in aircraft to provide greater strength for less weight
than conventional materials is now widely used. However, there are
penalties. The increased strength-to-weight ratio is bought at the
price of greater manufacturing difficulties, and thus increased
costs. The trade-off in capability against cost is relatively easy to
make in the case of aircraft and missiles, where extra mass requires
extra power and restricts manoeuvre. In slower surface vehicles, the
pay-off may not be so clear. In this field, the more productive area
for research may be in making manufacturing processes easier and
cheaper, and in using materials which are more readily repairable
under combat conditions. In this chapter, we examine those aspects of
materials science which may help military effectiveness.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Materials are everywhere. Without them, armies would fight naked
with bare knuckles. In the past, trial and error sorted out the
militarily useful materials from those of less merit. Some processes,
such as the refining of metals, hardening, the making of alloys and
the manufacturing developments of the industrial revolution brought
great improvements to weapons. Indeed the mechanisation of the
battlefield was a product of the new material processes of the
nineteenth century. However, it is only in this century that the
nature of matter has become understood in sufficient detail to tailor
materials to specific requirements. Glass and ceramics, once
synonymous with fragility, can today be stronger than steel.
Strength, weight, electrical properties, melting points, and all
other characteristics are now designed, and this technological
facility has great implications for future military equipment.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Every company depends on a range of materials for its economic and
security well-being. The oil crisis of 1973 was seen at the time as
showing the dependence of the industrialised nations on oil supplies.
The resolve shown in countering the Iraq invasion of Kuwait suggests
that States continue to take a keen interest in the availability of
their oil supplies. There are other less obvious key substances:
chromium, manganese, cobalt and platinum. In some areas fresh water
takes on the characteristics of a strategic material. While other
commodities may be vital, sources of supply are either so numerous or
so secure that they do not worry governments. A time may come when
quite common materials become scarce either through natural
exhaustion of supplies or political changes in supplier countries. In
any event, population increases and growth in economies will lead to
greater demand for key minerals. For the crucial commodities, nations
may form strategic stockpiles to help them weather particular
difficulties. After the 1973 oil embargo, the United States
established a strategic petroleum reserve of some 590 million
barrels. The reserve costs $200 million per year to maintain.(1)</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>A safer solution to the dependence on others for strategic
commodities is to develop alternative materials. The impetus for such
research is economic and commercial as much as a security issue.
Civil manufacturers do not wish their products to depend on
unreliable sources of raw materials, especially if finite resources
lead to increasing costs. In some cases, it is possible to develop
processes which use smaller quantities of the key material per unit
of production. Indeed the total material required may also be
reduced. The weight of the modern motor car has been reduced
significantly by the production of high-strength low-alloy steels.
Certain parts are now formed from polymer materials which have high
strength: plastic bumpers for example. The commercial factors at work
will be a financial assessment of performance, material costs and
manufacturing costs. The relative importance of these factors may be
different for the military. Nevertheless, commercial interests will
lead the development of new materials which can have military uses.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>A good example of the application of materials science is in the
manufacture of combat aircraft. A modern high performance aircraft is
subject to extreme stresses. Airframe temperatures may vary from -55C
at altitude to supersonic skin temperatures of 500C. Engine
components will operate at temperatures over 1000C. Ambient pressures
vary from atmospheric to near vacuum, while hydraulic pipes and
engine casings will operate at much higher pressures. Manoeuvring may
increase component weight by a factor of 10, and such 'g' forces may
be applied in very short periods. Engine components also suffer from
extreme mechanical loadings, corrosive hot gases and high vibration
levels. Modern and future combat aircraft design is crucially
dependent on new materials. (2)</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>While research must produce materials which can operate under such
extreme conditions, the most crucial consideration for aircraft is
the question of weight. For a commercial airliner, a reduction in
weight reduces operating costs and increase carrying capacity for a
given distance. For military aircraft, a reduction in weight also
brings great benefits. For a given design, a lighter aircraft can
carry more weapons, go further and carry more fuel. With the same
engine performance and payload, a lighter aircraft can accelerate
faster, climb to operating altitude more quickly, and be better at
evading or pursuing. Lighter materials may allow a different design
to give a smaller aircraft for a given capability. This can reduce
the radar cross-section and improve survivability. It could use
surplus carrying capability for self protection systems; it could be
more manoeuvrable. All these options improve survivability.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The aerospace industry has been at the forefront of the new
materials research and development. Advances have been made in the
synthesising of new materials and also in the development of
composite materials. The products can be designed not just to have
great strength but also to grow stronger a temperature increases. (3)
Nickel-based superalloys are strongest at about 850C, and retain
strength to around 1000C. This means that they can be used in jet
engine turbine blade manufacture. Cobalt-based alloys have higher
temperature characteristics, but lower overall strength. Where weight
is the most critical factor, titanium alloys offer an answer.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Strength can be provided not only by the composition of these
alloys, but also by adjusting the crystalline structure of the
substance to tailor strength to the role of the particular component.
A turbine blade can be given greater strength along its axis of
greatest strain through the process of directional solidification. In
this process, the crystals in the alloy are grown in columns by
selective heating and cooling. The metal is constructed with unique
characteristics for the component. Another advance has been in the
process of rapid-solidification technology. Just as the blacksmith
would temper his red hot metal by plunging it into cold water,
today's materials engineer adjusts an alloy's characteristics by
rapid cooling. At cooling rates in excess of one million degrees per
second, it is possible to produce predictable microstructure in
alloys. Such techniques are able to produce aluminium alloys with
strength/weight ratios better than titanium. One of the rapid cooling
processes uses high powered lasers passing over the metal's surface.
Using pre-alloyed powder, this laser-glazing process can construct
complex shapes with great strength and temperature resistance.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>While advanced metals are produced by adjusting alloy mixes and
tailoring processing to obtain the required characteristics,
composite materials are artificial constructions designed to produce
materials with the desired qualities. An early composite was
fibreglass-reinforced plastic. This now familiar car body repair
material uses the very high tensile strength of spun glass fibres
reinforced in a matrix of plastic bonding substance. The composite
material has properties of strength and flexibility unknown in its
components. The strength and stiffness of the composite is determined
by the reinforcing material. Single fibres or whiskers of substances
such as glass, silicon carbide and aluminium oxide show greater
strength than large pieces because, at the size of single crystals,
they have fewer flaws. By bundling the fibres together, like bamboo
canes, they add their strength together. If one strand breaks, the
others take the load. The matrix material holds the bundles of fibres
in the desired configuration. While fibreglass consisted of short
fibres embedded in polyester, the advanced composites are arranged in
a rigid polymer structure which gives much greater strength. Resins
which can survive temperatures in excess of 300C have now been
developed. At the highest temperatures, ceramic matrix materials
offer great promise. Borosilicate glass reinforced with silicon
carbide fibres retains its strength at 1000C, with more exotic mixes
operating up to 1700C.(4) Manufacture is difficult because the
ceramic materials are themselves heat resistant. For even higher
temperatures, the use of carbon-carbon composite material is
possible. Here graphite crystals form the fibres, with amorphous
carbon as the matrix. The advanced composites allow considerable
reduction in weight, better stiffness, improved fatigue
characteristics, greater fracture resistance and good thermal shock
tolerance.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>These new materials have applications in many fields outside of
aerospace. However the demands of the aircraft and space system
manufacturers will drive the research. New materials are not just
offering better replacements of traditional substances. In some areas
the new materials offer the prospect of new capabilities. The
transmission and processing of information has depended on electrical
transmission through conductors such as copper. New materials are
changing this dependence on the electrical conductivity of copper.
Superconducting materials allow electrical transmission without loss.
Information may be transmitted by photons rather than electrons using
fibre optics.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Superconductivity is the absence of all electrical resistance in a
substance. Over 80 years ago, it was demonstrated to occur in mercury
when it was cooled to temperatures close to absolute zero. As such,
it was an interesting laboratory phenomenon. The energy required to
cool the material exceeded any energy savings gained from lossless
transmission. Gradually researchers have developed materials which
exhibit superconductivity at ever higher temperatures. In 1987,
researchers at the University of Houston developed a compound of
yttrium, barium and copper oxide (YBCO) that superconducts at 90C
above absolute zero. This is a temperature that can be achieved at
very low cost, as liquid nitrogen is industrially produced and boils
at 77 C above absolute zero. There were two problems with YBCO: it
was a difficult material to work with as it was ceramic rather
metallic; and it was unable to cope with external magnetic fields.
Moving from wires to thin films has overcome these problems. Thin
films of YBCO can conduct five million amperes of current per square
centimetre at the temperature of liquid nitrogen. High-power
permanent electro-magnets, new forms of computer memory, lossless
power transmission and low level magnetic detection all become
possible. The research into relatively high temperature
superconductivity will continue because of the potential commercial
benefits, but there are also possible military applications.
Superconducting computer components will offer increases in speed and
power. Superconducting electric motors may offer both transport and
weapon projectile applications. Sensors for magnetic anomalies and
for electromagnetic radiation can be orders of magnitude more
sensitive, with implications for reconnaissance systems. Devices
using superconducting materials are now arriving in the military
signal processing field. A new sonar device covering a previously
inaccessible frequency range was developed in 1993 using
superconducting coils. Research continues on higher temperature
superconducting materials in the hope that a room temperature
material will prove possible. At the time of writing, the record is
held by a mercury, barium, calcium, copper oxide substance which
superconducts at a temperature of -109C, which is a temperature
obtainable with current air conditioning technology.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>For the processing of information, the advent of glass fibre has
made the use of photons feasible. Lasers can produce discrete pulses
of light which are conducted in an analogous manner to electrical
signals. The very high frequencies associated with light make the
information-carrying capacity of a fibre optic system between ten and
one hundred times greater than that of copper wire. From a military
aspect, fibre optic not only offers greater data bandwidth but also
greater security from jamming and interception. The widespread
replacement of copper wire based communication lines in the developed
world by fibre optic cable is only the first stage of the upgrading
of world communications. Above a transmission speed of about 50
gigabits per second, problems arise from the interface between the
optical and the electronic parts of any network. Research is now
focused on replacing the electronic amplifiers with optronic methods.
Optronic amplifiers with optical multiplexing systems offer the
prospect of 25 terabit per second per fibre bandwidth. Commercial
pressures will ensure that development work in this important area
continues, and bandwidth in communication should not be a problem in
the future.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In the field of electronics, considered in more detail in chapter
12, materials technology also has much to offer. Semiconductors have
led from the transistor to the integrated circuit with ever higher
component density. Today. chips containing tens of millions of
transistors are manufactured. Using silicon, the limit of component
density is fast being reached. To achieve faster processing, it will
be necessary to move to new materials, such as gallium arsenide, and
new material structures of a three-dimensional arrangement. At this
stage the work on optronic systems may come together with the
integrated circuit development to produce photonic integrated
circuits, which use photonic switches instead of transistor elements.
Prototypes are already available. The increasing use of glass fibre
based networks will ensure that research in this area has a
commercial incentive. It is likely that the development of photonic
switches controlled by photonic signals will lead to the development
of very high speed, high capacity information-processing systems.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>All the materials considered so far have been produced by
processes which have been evolutionary from the blacksmith tempering
the steel for a sword. Manufacturing processes have been discovered
which can reliably reproduce desired material characteristics in
large scale production. We are now on the verge of a revolutionary
change in our approach to materials. It was suggested by the
physicist Richard Feynman in 1959 that there were no laws of physics
which precluded the moving of material atom by atom. The idea that
materials can be assembled atom by atom offers a virtually infinite
prospect of novel substances. The term Nanotechnology has been used
to cover the technologies associated with manufacturing processes at
the sub-micron level. However, the revolutionary materials will be
produced from nanotechnology at the molecular level. The positioning
of individual Xenon atoms in a single crystal nickel surface, using a
Scanning Tunnelling Microscope (STM),has already been demonstrated..
The STM is a needle shaped probe which has a tip of a single atom. A
current tunnels from the tip to a conductive surface to move small
groups of atoms. Research is directed in a number of areas. Smaller
and smaller machines are being designed. Just as the integrated
circuit has led to a doubling of transistor density each 18 months,
there is a parallel trend in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).
These MEMS are produced by similar photolithographic processes to
integrated circuits. In 1995, it was reported that this technology
had been used to produce four micromotors to move an STM. These tiny
engines can push or pull the atomic tip of the STM at speeds as high
as a million times per second. (7). If such a system, with an array
of STMs, were used as a form of data storage, then the contents of
500 Encyclopaedia Britannica's would fit on a one square centimetre
chip.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>If it proves possible to produce materials which contain
microscopic machines, which can manipulate the structure at the
molecular level, the world will become a very different place. Self
assembling machines become possible; materials will repair
themselves; they will adapt their properties intelligently to the
requirements of their environment; they could be self replicating.
Since the properties of the material could be designed in at the
research stage, and the manufacturing cost would be much reduced, and
the product would not wear out in the normal sense; these new
materials would revolutionise the economy. It is likely therefore
that commercial interest will continue to sponsor research in the
field of nanotechnology. There will also be very significant military
implications for the use of such materials, and it is an area of
study which may repay investment in the medium term.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Looking to the military implications of the many new areas for
materials technology, it is clear that developments will profoundly
affect operational capabilities. In the construction of weapon
platforms, new materials will allow aircraft to fly further and
faster, tanks to survive better, warships to stay at sea longer and
submarines to range further while hidden. Reducing size for a given
performance will reduce detectability, and materials which absorb
rather than reflect radar can be built into the design. Jet engines
will be able to operate at higher internal temperatures for greater
efficiency. Communications will be more assured, and information
density greater. Greater computing power will be available in smaller
weapons. New sensors will make detection of the enemy easier by day
and by night.</P>

<P>At the same time, some of these materials are more difficult to
manufacture, and may require individual design for each component&gt;
This can make them difficult to repair and expensive to replace. In
any new design , it will be necessary to consider the costs as well
as the benefits. Battle damage repair may be much simpler in
traditional materials. Indeed, new materials are designed for the
forecasts stresses; but unpredictable battle conditions may test
beyond specification. The tale is told of the corrosion proof
fibreglass car which turns to powder on crash impact. Weapons must be
robust as well as efficient.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In space, the new materials will assume yet greater importance,
given the need to reduce weight wherever possible. The reductions in
weight, increase in strength and increase in engine performance may
begin to blur the distinction between operations in air and in space.
