			<h3><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Uncertain aims</font></h3>
			<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Iraq has become the issue of the moment after more than a decade of being largely ignored by the world. Only the US and the UK have been left policing the no-fly zones for the past four years, and the sanctions regime has been looking more and more porous. Now the Bush Administration gives daily warnings of the urgent need to tackle the dangers that Saddam Hussein poses. While many would  argue that the situation in Iraq was being held at an acceptable risk level by the previous strategy of containment, it is clear that this no longer an option for the leadership in America. They talk of the requirement for regime change if the world is to be made safe.<br>
					<br>
					Yet achieving regime change by military action is not a well tried practice. In recent times, rulers have gone in Argentina, Serbia and Afghanistan following conflict, but their removal was not the primary aim of the operation. While few doubt that the United States has the military power necessary to conquer Iraq, there have been few ideas as to how the country might be successfully governed subsequently. <br>
					<br>
					The situation changes by the day. However, there is a growing understanding both within the USA and more widely, that any long term solution to Iraq has the greatest chance of success if it is backed by the United Nations. The chances of disarming Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction are much enhanced by a rigorous international inspection regime. The threat of force makes Iraqi compliance more likely. Only when the diplomatic options are exhausted should military action become an option.</font></p>
			<h3><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The Diplomatic Strategy</font></h3>
			<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The route to a satisfactory outcome is still a difficult one. There are many potential problems. The US may intend military action whatever the UN does. Saddam Hussein may not give UN inspectors access. The UN may not be able to forge a common position.<br>
					<br>
					The French, at the time of writing, have suggested a two stage approach, and this seems very sensible. An initial new UN Resolution would contain the specific requirements for inspection in terms of start time, freedom of access and requirement for full co-operation. When the intitial inspection was complete, there would then be a second resolution in the light of the inspectors' report. This might extend their remit, or withdraw them and move to the military option.</font></p>
			<h4><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The military strategy</font></h4>
			<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">If this diplomatic strategy or a similar one is adopted, then a military strategy to complement it with the threat of military action must also be developed. There is little sign that this has yet been done by the US or the UK. The problems remain as to the endgame of any war with Iraq. The shape of the operation needs to take account of the management of post-conflict Iraq. <br>
					<br>
					If you want to remove Saddam Hussein by military force, you need to know what is to replace him. If a local faction is acceptable, then any campaign needs to promote the power of that group. If a government in exile is to be brought in, then the chosen leadership must not be made to appear as new oppressors. If there is no clear government in waiting, then the intervention plan must take into account the need to keep the peace over a large, well armed, fractious community for years to come.<br>
					<br>
					The length of any war with Iraq would depend on the strength of US political will, and a willingness to accept casualties to their own side. How the war would run is, as always, unpredictable. Saddam Hussein would be unlikely to give US ground troops, assembling for an invasion of Iraq, a free ride. Allied troops would need to protect themselves against possible use of biological and chemical agents. This has implications for sustained operations. It would be unwise to attempt a military operation without overwhelming forces available. They might not be needed in the event, but their presence would shape the thinking of Iraq.<br>
					<br>
					As the noose tightened around Saddam Hussein, he would have to think about his own exit strategy. He could surrender to save his country from yet more destruction. This seems unlikely on past performance. He could flee with his dedicated followers like Osama bin Laden, and continue the war against the West by other means. Or he might take a death or glory route from his final bunker. In this case, he might decide that igniting a regional conflict would leave him personally no worse off.<br>
					<br>
					The three possible ends for Saddam all give problems for the world in general, and America in particular. If he resigns (or is killed), the levers of power would transfer to his equally unpleasant colleagues. The problem of the future of Iraq would not have been solved. If he flees, then we have created a new international terrorist threat to add to al-Qaeda. His followers could certainly bring biological and chemical terror weapons into play, and we could expect wholesale destruction of oil facilities in the region. If he decides to go down with the sinking ship, then he may choose to use his small number of  longer range missiles against Israel. A chemical attack, on Tel Aviv , whether real or wrongly identified, might draw a nuclear retaliation on Baghdad. </font></p>
			<h4><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Conclusion</font></h4>
			<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">This analysis, which is as uncertain as any predictions about war, strongly suggests that we need to work very hard to ensure that the diplomatic route succeeds if at all possible. In order to do that we must face up to the need to make a credible military threat. The consequences of not following through with the UN route are that war is likely to happen anyway. We would then have all the negative consequences of a war in the region, and in addition an end to any effectiveness of the United Nations. This would be the worst of all worlds.<br>
					<br>
					The UK therefore should continue to use its special influence with the US Administration to urge continued engagement with the UN process. If diplomacy fails, force must remain an option under UN auspices.</font></p>
