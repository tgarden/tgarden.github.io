<H3><CENTER>The Time for European Defence is Now</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER> by Tim Garden and John Roper    </CENTER></P>

<P>	After a long period when the effective development of European
defence capabilities has  been a matter of speeches rather than
action, 1999 has seen significant progress.  The Kosovo operation
proved that European nations lack the offensive airpower capability
for NATO's new role, and that they were no better prepared to mount a
potentially hostile ground campaign. The NATO Summit in Washington in
April, the Western European Union ministerial in Bremen in May and
the European Council at K&ouml;ln in June provided progressive moves
towards developing the defence dimension of a Common Foreign and
Security Policy for the European Union. It was recognised that the
bureaucratic morass of NATO, WEU and EU relationships on security
could be significantly eased by the simple expedient of letting the
EU take on the WEU tasks.</P>

<P>	This was all very largely the result of the startling change in
the position of the United Kingdom over the past year.  Experience
over Iraq and the Balkans had moved Tony Blair towards a wish for
active co-operation on European defence. From the Anglo-French summit
in December 1998 through to the Anglo-Italian summit in July 1999, we
have seen a strengthening of British resolve to make Europe more
effective in its defence capabilities.</P>

<P>	The Kosovo air campaign showed that even the United Kingdom,
which prided itself on being a serious military power, could only
contribute 4% of the effort. Tony Blair found his influence on policy
for the war strategy in Washington  reflected the relative
contributions between the United States and Europe.  Kosovo was
fought with American capability using American doctrine. Unless the 2
million troops and 3000 combat aircraft in Europe could be turned
into an effective military force, Europeans would have to continue to
wait for the United States to decide tactics for security operations
in Europe and beyond.  So the time is unlikely ever to be better for
a serious attempt to rebalance the NATO partnership between the US
and Europe. EU members are open to suggestions for ways to make their
military forces more appropriate and cost effective.  Tony Blair is
enthusiastic, more so than many in his Ministry of Defence, for real
progress on European Defence. Many initiatives will take years to
implement, but there are some useful concrete proposal which could
provide more capability very quickly.   </P>

<P>	The long term vision for Europe should foresee the possibility
of a distant future when an enlarged EU, without internal borders, is
so interdependent that it will be natural to pool and fund all its
military capability at the European level. Europe will have vital
interests as a global economic power; and it will need a foreign and
security policy to protect those interests. While such a vision may
never come to pass, there are still  policies which can be proposed
in the short to medium term which could improve capabilities whatever
the long term outcome. In the next few months, the EU could agree a
number of areas where much needed military capability could be
operated at the European level without danger to national
sovereignty, but at much greater effectiveness. To retain
sovereignty, nations would need to be able to withhold or withdraw
their contributions to meet national requirements. Capabilities where
this would be possible  might include a common air transport and
air-to-air refuelling force operated on a similar basis to the long
standing and successful NATO AWACs force. Navies might build on the
example of the Belgian/Netherlands joint Headquarters for the
operations of their frigates. Land forces could look to expanding the
example of the joint Nordic logistic support arrangements in Bosnia.
In every case more effective capability would be provided at less
cost.  </P>

<P>	 In the medium term the focus should turn to ways to produce
more effective combat capabilities. Five EU nations are ordering the
Eurofighter for delivery from 2002 onwards. Each nation will set up
its headquarters for planning and support, a training base, and a
myriad of support organisations. Over a period of years, each nation
will change its version of Eurofighter in different ways (just as we
have seen with the Tornado). Interoperability will get worse as times
goes on, unless there is common management and doctrine. This is a
role for a single EU military headquarters, which would operate an EU
mixed nationality Eurofighter force of perhaps 400 aircraft. If any
nation still felt the need to retain some independent national
capability, it could rotate crews and aircraft through the EU force
on a regular basis. Beyond Eurofighter, France, Italy, Spain and the
UK want to keep in the aircraft carrier game. The UK  can only afford
an inadequate force of two carriers. Between them, the maritime
minded nations of the EU could field a serious  capability of 4 or 5
carriers supported by the frigates, submarines, helicopters and mine
counter-measure vessels provided by other EU nations. For the armies
of Europe, the need is for rapidly deployable forces with a range of
capabilities. The EU could set the guidelines to produce a well
balanced force structure.    </P>

<P>	As the EU moved along these paths, it would be important to
ensure that there was no free ride for less enthusiastic members. The
establishment of a European Defence Budget would be an early priority
and would force member nations to take a serious interest in agreeing
what capability Europe needs. Nations could then either contribute
capability  or funds. This would undoubtedly lead to a virtuous
circle of  each nation volunteering force capability, and  a
realisation that they get more capability when their defence budget
supports European rather than national forces. 	</P>

<P>	Finally, as forces were increasingly operated at the European
level, the common doctrine and operational planning would lead to
common equipment requirements. Role specialisation might happen, but
it would be in a planned manner rather than the random system of
today. The inefficiencies of duplicated support that we see in
today's multinational forces would be eliminated. Europe would be a
more equal partner with the United States within NATO, and would be
able to field its own diplomatic and military capability if
necessary. Nor, after restructuring costs,  would it need to spend
any more than it does in total now on defence.     </P>
