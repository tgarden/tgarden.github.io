			<h3>Tanker Aircraft and European Defence</h3>
			<p><i>by Sir Timothy Garden</i></p>
		</div>
		<p>One of the more exciting Public Private Partnership proposals has been the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft (FSTA). There seem to be some new straws in the wind as to how this may be taken forward, and they could be good news for the great European defence adventure.</p>
		<p>Tanker aircraft are just airliners that are fitted with vast fuel tanks instead of passenger seats. They loiter in the sky acting as mobile gas stations for fighters and bombers, which would otherwise have to land and refuel to continue their missions. In the jargon of the strategic planner, air-to-air refuelling is a force multiplier. Without it, some tasks would not be possible, and most would need many more combat aircraft. Europe is very short of tanker capability: most of it is either British or French. The UK tanker force of some 35 VC10 and Tristar aircraft is getting very elderly. </p>
		<p>In looking at ways to update and enlarge this essential capability, the question was asked as to whether it has to be operated by the Services. After all this is a fluctuating requirement: a lot of fuel is offloaded during a campaign like Kosovo, whereas in quieter times the training requirement may be quite small. For other such variable requirements, outsourcing has been used to even the load. The critics of the proposal to look at PPP for this contract pointed out that refuelling combat aircraft near hostile airspace might be a little different from contracting out the Whitehall car pool. Yet one by one the various concerns are being met. It is likely that the aircrew will need to have a form of military Reserve commitment (to be known as sponsored reserves). Arrangements for returning surplus capacity to the civil air cargo market will be difficult, but not insuperable. </p>
		<p>The contract will be lucrative with perhaps more  than &pound;2bn up front and &pound;9bn through the life of the force. The RAF seem content that this will provide them an essential capability enhancement at an affordable price. Just before Christmas the MOD announced that it had reduced the possible bids down to four contenders: Air Reach (Rolls Royce), BAE Systems, Eurotanker and the Serco-led SSM.</p>
		<p>The Defence Select Committee in their report on Kosovo noted the disproportionately large contribution which the RAF made to European air to air refuelling. They expressed surprise that despite doing so much of Europe's work in this area, we were about to spend even more to improve our capability. We can hope that someone in Government has seen the merits of asking EU colleagues to join in this Tanker aircraft project. After all there are no great sovereignty issues if we are prepared to contract out the task to a commercial company. Perhaps Geoff Hoon might offer EU colleagues a piece of the action. If the UK put half its pot of gold into the pool, and others matched according to the usual EU budget shares, a very significant capability would be affordable. Some of the spare change could be used towards the EU military needs such as intelligence or command and control systems. With the decision on FSTA not due until 2002, there might just be the time  to turn this into the first real EU defence improved capability project - and it would be one that freed up money for other key needs.</p>
		<p>The aircraft to be used are at the discretion of the companies making the bid. There would be some obvious political attractions to an EU wide concept which used an Airbus derivative.</p>
