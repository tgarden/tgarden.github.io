			<p><font size="-1">With war seemingly inevitable within hours, weapon designers will be looking forward to another opportunity for field testing new products. The US Air Force has just demonstrated its ten ton guided bomb for the first time at a range in Florida. The Mass Ordnance Air Burst munition is known by its faintly biblical acronym of MOAB. The hype declares it to be the world's largest non-nuclear explosive device: it packs a punch well above the renowned Daisycutter BLU-52 that came to fame in the hunt for al Qaeda in the caves of Tora Bora.  MOAB may not  be ready for action in the coming weeks, but it is obviously being trialled as part of the psychological warfare against Iraq. <br>
					<br>
					How would the MOAB and its smaller cousin BLU-52 help conquer Iraq? Despite the addition of precision satellite guidance through the global positioning system, the MOAB remains an area weapon. Air burst was something that we used to think of for nuclear weapon delivery. While a conventional bomb has no radiation problem to worry about &#150; despite the mushroom cloud that it generates &#150; the greater extent of the explosive effect is important. The targets have to be clearly military, as this weapon cannot discriminate between civilian and soldier. It therefore has no legitimate role in the urban warfare that is expected to be key. Armour concentrations in the desert will be vulnerable to its effects, just as they were to the B52 carpet bombing in the last Gulf War. <br>
					<br>
					Area effect weapons do not have to be so big, or so heavy. The cluster bomb remains in US and UK inventories. Here a shower of small munitions  are  released over the target area. They can be effective against dispersed groups of military vehicles. The problem is that some of the munitions remain unexploded and act much like landmines for a long time afterwards. Perhaps, we shall see manufacturers  argue that the new air burst bombs are more humane as they leave no long term hazard after they have killed everyone within their impact area.<br>
					<br>
					Technology in the precision weapon area has allowed the production of accurate guidance for old fashioned bombs at very marginal extra cost. It is expected that as many as 80% of the bombs used in the coming war will be guided. A simple GPS system can fly the bomb to its target as it falls from the aircraft. Of course, as the 1999 inhabitants of the Belgrade Chinese embassy found,  precision also requires the right target co-ordinates to be fed into the system.<br>
					<br>
					In the Kosovo campaign a new graphite dispensing weapon was used to short out power stations. There remains debate over the legitimacy of such targets, which have significant effects on civilian survival. Nevertheless, we may see more of these type of novel weapons in use as the US tries to cut off the regime from all support. High power microwave generators may be fielded for the first time. The aim would be to disable electronic devices and thus separate Saddam Hussein from his forces. If these weapons are used, we shall have to hope that friendly forces are able to protect their own equipment from the effects. Laser weapons that can blind are now internationally prohibited: the high energy microwave may find itself in the same category if it causes unnecessary suffering to people in its path.<br>
					<br>
					Defence research establishments have also been working on a range of imaginative &quot;non-lethal weapons&quot;. They would more properly be described as not always lethal incapacitating agents. They range from sticky foam to diarrhoea inducing weapons. Some have had their genesis in crowd control agents like CS gas. Oddly what may be legal for the police to use at home may be banned as a chemical weapon when at war.<br>
					<br>
					In the end, the new toys will make little difference to the outcome. Few believe that Iraq can defeat the military  power of the US in a classic battle. War is to a considerable extent about the will to fight. US technology is being shaped to break the Iraqi military will. At the same time, Saddam Hussein will be planning his campaign to make America pay an unbearable price. He may believe that America will find it difficult to sustain its will if casualties mount rapidly in an apparently endless attrition war.</font></p>
