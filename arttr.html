<P>FUTURE TERRORISM</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Plutonium smuggled out of Russia is the latest horror story to
keep the nervous awake at night. Such stories are inevitably followed
by a gripping scenario of a terrorist organisation using an atomic
device to force governments into acceding to their demands. Reading
these three books, we should be better able to judge what risks there
of such a happening, and what might be done  to reduce the curse of
the modern terrorist.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The cover of  Paul Wilkinson'sTechnology and Terrorism claims that
it fills a huge gap in the literature by addressing the question of
the part that technology  has played in terrorist and
counter-terrorist capabilities. This is an ambitious undertaking for
a short collection of nine individual papers of which four focus
exclusively on aviation security issues. While aviation security is
an important subject, an earlier chapter in the book cites airlines
as accounting for 38% of terrorist operations in the late 60's, 21%
in the 70's and only 12% in the 80's.  Indeed, this piece on trends
in international terrorism is a useful review of the last twenty
years, which helps to put the threat into perspective. Bombing
continues to be the preferred terrorist action, representing about
half of the 8000 incidents examined since 1968. Technology has been
applied by terrorists to make their fairly crude devices more
controllable and predictable, rather than to move to new more exotic
weapons. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>These experts discuss the potential use of technology to provide 
chemical, biological or nuclear weapons for terrorist operations.
Although the threat is not discounted - and a detailed analysis of
possible methods is given - the analysis concludes on a relatively
optimistic note. It is argued that casualties from a nuclear incident
would be disproportionate and would risk alienating the terrorists' 
perceived constituents. Chemical agents offer few advantages over the
more traditional methods of terror killings, and require a more
complex logistical infrastructure. The book gives less clear guidance
on future roles that biological terror weapons might have.  In a
chilling quote, we are told: "the resources required to mount a
credible mass destruction threat with a biological weapon are trivial
compared to those required for a credible explosive nuclear threat".
None of this gives a satisfactory explanation for the current flurry
of plutonium smuggling out of Russia.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Richard Clutterbuck, who provides a chapter for Paul Wilkinson's
book, develops his arguments inTerrorism in an Unstable World. He
begins with a look at the implications of the new post-Communist
world order. A brief tour of the world reminds the reader of the many
areas of potential and actual conflict. He identifies an increasing
threat from destabilization of the international order and a growing
menace from communal strife. It is clear that he is looking at a very
broad definition of terrorism, which extends into all possible areas
of military involvement. The examples are up to date with Bosnia and
Somalia, but the publishing deadline misses Rwanda. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Next we learn how technological development affects this security
problem. Interestingly, his first concern is over where technology is
making society more vulnerable. The increasing dependence of modern
society on electronic data systems for every aspect of life has
introduced new dangers. The hacker can cripple businesses; the
electronic eavesdropper can gain intelligence; electronic cash eases
money laundering by illegal groups; and the bomber has new critical
computer centre targets. The effect of technology on the more
traditional weapons is then reviewed. Developments in personal
weapons, missiles and bombs are covered in considerable detail.
Reflecting the author's views on the importance to the terrorist of
low tech weapons, little space is given to the possible use of
weapons of mass destruction. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Technology also helps the defender. Much work has been done on
detecting concealed guns, explosive material and bombs. The
techniques are named, but the interested reader would need to refer
to the Wilkinson book for a detailed description of how each works.
This quick survey of the many methods of detection concludes that
none is foolproof, and that multiple approaches are necessary. This
is expensive and is likely only to be justified where many lives are
at stake, as in the airline security case. The knowledge that
effective detection is available deters the terrorist, who then moves
on to softer targets. This explains the remarkable drop in aviation
terrorist incidents.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>As important as detecting the presence of weapons is the
identification of the terrorist. Here Intelligence, in its military
sense, is the key. The benefits of technology to this process are
ascribed to the increasing power of computers and the development of
artificial intelligence techniques. The author anticipates these
techniques benefiting from the power available through parallel
processor based computers. He describes how a German terrorist was
caught by running a cross check on who in the city of Frankfurt had
paid electricity bills and hire-purchase bills in cash. The first run
produced 18,000 names which were refined down by approaching more
companies for their payment records, until their were just two names.
One was a terrorist and the other a drug dealer. While the hardware
for such work can be described in detail and reliable extrapolations
of capability forecast, the software and data access are two more
intractable problems which are not addressed in this book.
Programming large parallel processing computers to carry out logical
inference tasks has a more uncertain future. But more importantly,
access to the vast quantities of multi-source data in a democracy
raises some difficult questions, which are only fully addressed in
the third book under review. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Clutterbuck then briefly turns his attention to drugs. He reviews
where the drugs come from, what the drugs do, what they earn and the
downstream effects. This  short section concludes with a very
personal view on measures needed to counter drugs in the West. He
recommends a "life-meaning-life" prison sentence for drug dealers.
There would be a harsh regime available as a punishment for those who
stepped out of line once in prison. The addicts would be subject to
compulsory treatment at home or in custody as necessary. He cites the
approaches of Turkey and Japan as successful ways to counter the drug
problem. Again, some will feel that the implications for a western
liberal democracy may need deeper consideration, as may the evidence
of the effectiveness of repressive measures on the drug economy.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>After a review of rural guerrilla warfare, the author considers
urban terrorism and brings together the techniques and capabilities
discussed in the opening chapters. He makes a forceful case for the
introduction of modern identity cards with machine readable data.
Developing this idea in the context of airport security, he advocates
a system which would allow fast  boarding by reliable passengers
using smart identity cards. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The conclusion to this fascinating tour of every aspect of modern
conflict introduces yet more new ideas. The future of NATO (as an
executive arm of the UN) is sorted out in three paragraphs. The
author even solves the funding of UN peacekeeping forces in a few
lines. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Finally, the question of civil liberties and the rule of law is
addressed. Unsurprisingly, Richard Clutterbuck advocates a robust
approach in every area. Starting from the thesis that "Most people
accept the interference with their freedom when they are searched at
airports, as preferable to being blown up or hijacked", it is all too
easy to justify much greater intrusion into an individual's privacy.
He suggests that fears about misuse of  computer  data could be
allayed by automatic monitoring of all access to the computer
records. This seems a doubtful safeguard.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The balance between centralised control and individual freedom in
the war against terrorism and criminal behaviour is a difficult one
for any liberal democracy. Lustgarten and Leigh, both academic
lawyers, have produced a substantial volume on the topic. In from the
Cold  is not an exciting spy thriller or a dubious expos&eacute; of
the undercover world of Intelligence. It is a heavyweight academic
analysis of the democratic concept of national security; the
government powers, agencies and measures which support that security;
and the mechanisms for authorising, controlling, monitoring,
criticising and investigating the national security institutions.
Although the focus is on the United Kingdom, comparisons in each area
with the practices of two other Westminster democracies (Canada and
Australia) are made.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The authors raise many issues without necessarily offering
solutions. In looking at the legal framework, they have concentrated
on the national laws. However, as they acknowledge, the
post-Maastricht concept of Community citizenship may have significant
implications for the way national security operations are authorised.
Their material is up to date, with a section written at the end of
1993 on the new legislation covering the Secret Intelligence Service,
GCHQ and the Security Service. It is a book which should be part of
the initial training course for any prospective member of those three
organisations. It is also valuable reading for anyone in government
whose work may touch on the inevitable tension between national
security and democratic freedoms. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The three books leave the reader with a sense of great sympathy
for those who are tasked with countering terrorism. Unlike
conventional warfare, the enemy can be anywhere and can choose the
time, the place and the method of his terror action. Countering
terrorism can exploit new technologies, but remains a mixture of
defensive measures, intelligence, and ordinary police work. The
apparently easy solutions may have their own dangers for democracy.
If the optimists are wrong, and nuclear terrorism is in prospect,
then the national security approach may well move away from those
which a liberal democracy expects. Let us hope the optimists are
right.</P>
