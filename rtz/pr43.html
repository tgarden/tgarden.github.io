<P><BR>

The RTZ-CRA Group and Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold (FCX) today
signed definitive documentation of previously announced agreements in
principle for exploration and expansion joint ventures. As a result,
RTZ-CRA has acquired from FCX's Indonesian mining subsidiary, PT
Freeport Indonesia Company (PTFI), a 40% interest in all future
production expansions above 118,000 tonnes of ore per day under
PTFI's contract of work.<BR>

<BR>

RTZ-CRA and FCX and its Indonesian subsidiaries agreed in principle
in May 1995 to establish joint venture programmes. Pursuant to the
definitive documentation signed today, RTZ-CRA has fulfilled its
commitment to fund $100 million of exploration expenses. Once this
amount has been fully expended subsequent exploration expenditure
will be shared 60 per cent by FCX's subsidiaries and 40 per cent by
RTZ-CRA. RTZ-CRA has also contributed $84m of expansion costs. This
comprises both its own 40% share of costs to date and an advance to
PTFI under a $450 million non-recourse loan towards PTFI's share of
costs for expansion activities above 118,000 tonnes of ore per day in
PTFI's Block A area, where current mining and milling operations are
underway.<BR>

<BR>

Once the expansion is completed, RTZ-CRA will receive 100 per cent of
incremental cash flows from the expanded operations above 118,000
tonnes of ore per day until RTZ-CRA recoups the amount loaned to
PTFI. Subsequently, cash flows from the expanded operations will be
shared 60 per cent by PTFI and 40 per cent by RTZ-CRA. FCX will
retain 100 per cent of the production and cash flows associated with
the mill throughput up to 118,000 tonnes per day.<BR>

<BR>

As previously announced, RTZ-CRA and FCX have established the
economic justification for an expansion of PTFI's facilities, subject
to approval of the relevant Indonesian authorities. Engineering
activities have begun on the expansion of PTFI's Indonesian
operations which are currently producing at a throughput rate of
125,000 tonnes of ore per day. The optimum rate of this "fourth
concentrator mill expansion" is expected to be at least 190,000 to
200,000 tonnes of ore per day and completion is expected in the
second half of 1998. Costs for this expansion to achieve optimum
throughput rates are expected to approximate $960 million, including
$300 million to construct a coal fired power plant and related
facilities. <STRONG><BR>
