			<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Why would Saddam Hussein let the world believe he still had a hidden arsenal of weapons of mass destruction if they were all long gone? This is the question repeated by those in the British and American governments who are finding the absence of any evidence of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons in Iraq increasingly embarrassing. It is a question that deserves an answer. Getting inside the mind of a despotic, ruthless, survivor like Saddam is not easy. Yet there are a number of possible explanations for such deception.<br>
					<br>
					Back in the early 90's Iraq had a formidable battlefield chemical weapon capability. Saddam had authorised the use of such weapons both in Northern Iraq and against the Iranian army.  That he did not use them against the Allies in the Gulf War is usually put down to his fear of nuclear retaliation by US forces. He may well have taken another lesson: that the Allies did not continue from freeing Kuwait onwards to Baghdad because of their fear of his WMD. Certainly the difficulties that he made for the UN inspectors in the years which followed showed that he wanted to maintain his WMD capabilities. Now it appears that he was unsuccessful in this quest. A combination of persistence by the inspection teams and the years of sanctions appear to have left him with little or no usable capability. <br>
					<br>
					Why then would he not welcome the opportunity to show the world that he was clean? He believed, probably rightly, that the US would continue to oppose any rewards for good behaviour. So he had little to gain. Perhaps more importantly, the sanctions regime helped him stay in power. He could blame the West for all the suffering of ordinary Iraqis. As long as sanctions continued, he could manage the UN Food for Oil programme as a way of maintaining his control of the country. Sanctions breaking was also a way of earning plenty of hard currency for family and friends.<br>
					<br>
					Since 2001, the pressure from the US increased yet further. Iraq was top of George Bush's Axis of Evil. Saddam may have hoped that WMD, whether real or illusory, could once again deter attack. In any event, widespread belief in them would make an attack more difficult. Western forces would be hampered by having to fight in protective suits. But he must have hoped that he could play it both ways. Co-operation, like the 12,000 page dossier he gave to the UN, might indefinitely delay the war. <br>
					<br>
					As Saddam watched the media last year, he must have enjoyed the added twist  given to his fairy tale deterrence by the 45 minute to launch claim. In some great British Intelligence whispering game, an unremarkable military fact turned into a threat to frighten the world. No doubt with filled chemical weapon shells close to the guns, the Iraqi artillery forces were capable of targeting and firing in well under 45 minutes. An Iraqi informer relayed that he had heard this from a military source.  The Defence Intelligence Service analysts in London would agree that it was practical for battlefield use. As we now know the caveats fell away in the process of distilling intelligence into the public dossier.<br>
					<br>
					Perhaps we should all have taken more notice of page 36 of the WMD dossier. There is a short essay on &quot;Iraq's policy of deception&quot;. Deception can be done in many ways. In Kosovo, much of the British and American bombing was later found to be against decoys rather than tanks. In Iraq, it looks as though we may also have been tilting at windmills.<br>
