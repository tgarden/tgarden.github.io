<H3>Lessons of the 90's</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P> 	The end of the Cold War left  NATO with a vast and expensive
set of military forces, which had been practising to fight a single
campaign for over 40 years. The planning assumptions for an all out
war in Europe were relatively simple. The enemy was well defined and
consisted of the aggregate forces of the  Warsaw Pact. The exact
locations, strengths of forces, tactics to be used and phases of the
war were studied by generations of soldiers. The fall of the Berlin
Wall, the unification of Germany, the demise of the Warsaw Pact and
the Soviet Union, all changed the strategic landscape in Europe in
little more than a 3 year period.  NATO's purpose was suddenly in
question as nations scrambled to cash in on the peace dividend. Yet
in the event, the decade of the 90's has had more diverse military
action by the Western nations, under various banners, than at any
time previously.  Kuwait, Iraq, Somalia, Rwanda, Bosnia, Haiti,
Albania, Kosovo and East Timor have seen western military force
deployed to less than benign environments. A new doctrine for peace
support operations  has replaced the manuals on flexible response in
the military staff colleges of the Alliance.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	This series of military experiences is sufficient now to have
established a strong consensus on the new rationale for NATO, which
was articulated in the Strategic Concept  launched at the NATO summit
in Washington in April 1999. The ever increasing data from real
operations, rather than deterrence postures, has also highlighted the
major shortcomings in the security capabilities available to the
Alliance for these new tasks. The Gulf War, while not a NATO
operation, was conducted by an ad hoc coalition drawn for the most
part from NATO members. It was conducted using NATO procedures with
forces drawn from NATO formations.  It was a relatively clear cut
case for the international community to react to aggression, and thus
an almost ideal trial for the concept of enforcing international law.
Iraq had clearly broken international law by invading Kuwait, and the
UN could authorise military action to expel the invaders. Iraq had
few friends among its neighbours; had an oppressive regime with
potentially dissident  groups; and  was  remote to US and European
publics. The US led coalition was able to take its time in building
up military presence in the surrounding area. The then novel doctrine
of a prolonged air campaign  was tested successfully.  Lack of
casualties to the allies made the 6 weeks of offensive air action
acceptable to politicians and public. The early losses of UK Tornados
had caused great concern, and it became clear to the military
commanders that safety was to take priority over short term
effectiveness.  The much greater availability of precision guidance
for bombs had also set a precedent in terms of what was acceptable
collateral damage in this type of operation. The 4 days of ground war
reinforced this new vision of  war: ground forces sent in only when
it was safe to secure the victory that had been won  relatively
bloodlessly from the air. </P>

<P>	The key lesson from the Gulf  War was that the US was both
quantitatively and qualitatively in a different  capability league
from all the other nations involved. As the French discovered to
their annoyance, if you could not operate to US/NATO procedures, then
you were kept out of the action. In the air, it was a war of
offensive air operations, and these had to be conducted from medium
to high altitudes. Air defence fighters had little work to do. The
European nations had invested heavily in  fighters to protect
themselves from the long range Russian bombers of the Cold War. For
their offensive operations, they had depended on low flying tactics
to improve their survivability against Warsaw Pact air defence
systems, while accepting that there would be a significant attrition
rate. In a war that was expected to last only  days before going
nuclear, training and equipment were posited on achieving rapid
results. Somalia reinforced the perception internationally that the
US was only prepared to remain engaged if their troops were kept
safe. The pre-dominance of airpower solutions to international crises
was underlined by the continuing air operations over both Northern
and Southern Iraq. Operation Provide Comfort had successfully,
through air operations, rescued the displaced Kurds who had fled from
their homes in Northern Iraq. It was less clear that the results for
the Marsh Arabs in the South were as positive. While there was a need
for some fighter capability to police the air exclusion zones, it
could be carried out as the secondary role of either bomber or
reconnaissance aircraft. </P>

<P>	The sequence of events in Bosnia reinforced the US view that
offensive airpower could provide the necessary coercion to bring
recalcitrant leaders to the negotiating table. That the history of
the region up to the Dayton accord is considerably more complex is
unimportant. There is a widespread perception among  American
decision makers that the threat and application of air strikes was
critical to obtaining Milosevic's agreement to the Dayton proposals.
Again, in this short air campaign, the world expected precision
attacks with no collateral damage and no losses to our own side. When
an airman was lost over hostile territory, combat search and rescue
effort became the over-riding priority. Operation Alba, the response
to the breakdown of law and order in Albania, showed that there were
crises which required a European coalition of the willing response.
In this case, it was clear that the mechanisms for putting together
such a coalition were imperfect, and that a successful outcome was
only possible because of  the relatively benign environment.</P>

<P>	The 1999 Kosovo air campaign brought together all the political
and military lessons that had been learned in the post Cold War
operations. The US had expended a good deal of research on improving
its precision weapons. Nevertheless, the use of laser designation
remained a significant constraint if the target was obscured by
weather. The two other precision systems (GPS navigation and TERCOM
ground mapping) were available both in bombs and cruise missiles, but
were significantly more expensive and limited to fixed targets. They
required access to US national data. Nevertheless, this mix of
weaponry allowed the campaign to be planned on a requirement for no
casualties to NATO forces, and minimal collateral damage. These
constraints undoubtedly prolonged the air campaign, but given that
the required outcome was ultimately achieved, we can expect future
operations to have similar assumptions about the requirement for very
low numbers of casualties.</P>

<P>	 The contributions from the 14  NATO nations which took part
were varied, but all were overshadowed by the US. For example, the UK
 carried out 1618 of the total of 38,004 NATO sorties flown, or just 
over 4%4 . 102 of these sorties were the Sea Harriers doing little
more than defending the small  anti-submarine warfare carrier that
they are deployed on. 324 were air-to-air refuelling aircraft
aircraft  mainly supporting the Tornados that operated from their
bases in Germany. The UK E3-D airborne early warning aircraft clocked
up 184 sorties. The sorties which mattered were those carrying out
offensive attacks, and here the total UK effort was in the range 4%
to 10% depending on the method of calculation (the lower figure
reflects munition numbers and the higher missions flown)5 , and we
know that in many of these cases it was not possible to release
weapons. From 1008 RAF bombing sorties just 1011 weapons were
released.   Of these three quarters were non-precision weapons. The
story is similar for the other non-US NATO air forces. The US
provided 70% of the total aircraft and 80% of the total weapons
delivered.  Europe was shown to be good at providing political
support for the operation, but poorly equipped to contribute to an
offensive air campaign in an effective way. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>What Air Assets are available or Planned</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	The United States Defence budget for 1998 was $270 bn  from a
GDP of  $8.1 tr. Out of almost exactly the same total GDP,  the EU
nations together spent some $173 bn on defence or 64% of the US
total.   The US fields some 1.4 million professional forces and
almost as many ready reserves. The EU runs 1.8 million troops of
which 700,000 are conscripts and retains 3.6 million reservists at
various stages of readiness. These raw budget and personnel
statistics show clearly why Europe is so far behind the US in its
military hardware development. Europe fields more full time troops,
and very many more reservists, than the United States, yet spends
only half as much on defence. It is often claimed that the major
factor in differences in US and EU capabilities stems from an all
regular force in America being compared with a largely conscript
force in Europe. As can be seen from the figures, this is not the
main issue. If all conscription were eliminated, and two thirds  of
the reservists were released, the EU could field over one million
professional soldiers,sailors and airmen.  </P>

<P>	If Europe, however defined, wishes to be a more equal partner
with the United States in its ability to intervene internationally,
it  needs to spend its defence money differently. It is currently
trying to support far too large a number of regular forces,
conscripts and reserves on too little funds. This means that little
is available for funding research, development and the procurement of
equipment and weapon stocks. While the United States is hardly a
perfect example for tight control of defence spending, it is
nevertheless achieving a different order of military capability for
its expenditure. This suggests that Europe needs either to raise its
defence spending, or reduce and restructure its forces to match the
current spending more effectively. It is unlikely that there will be
much political enthusiasm among nations for raising defence
expenditure, and it is therefore more sensible to look at how
European nations might work together at restructuring their military
forces to provide more appropriate capabilities to the likely demands
of the future.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Finding a Defence Role for Europe</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Before making any assessment of the appropriate size and shape
of future European armed forces, we need to examine the nature of the
current and future security need. NATO remains firmly committed to
its collective defence requirement. Individual national governments
have a responsibility for the territorial defence of their lands,
which they  exercise  through NATO membership. Yet the current threat
to territorial integrity is very remote, and the planning assumption
is that there would be a long warning time of any newly emerging
threat. It is important that European governments analyse the degree
of risk that they are prepared to take in this area if there is to be
a sensible allocation of defence resources.</P>

<P>	Much of the force structure in Europe is still drawn from the
Cold War days, when the priority was to deter the threat of a short
warning time invasion by Warsaw Pact forces across the Inner German
Border. The nature of such a threat determined the need for forward
defensive positions on the ground supported by heavy armour with
limited need for range. In the air, the need was for very good early
warning detection to direct large numbers of air defence fighters and
ground-based surface-to-air missiles. Those countries, such as the
United Kingdom, which were further distant from the border, could
develop air defences on the basis of long range engagement of
incoming bombers. At sea,  anti-submarine warfare was a high
priority. Overlaying the force planning process for this set piece
campaign was the assumption that if the conventional battle were
lost, then nuclear weapons would be used. For some European nations,
this meant that there was little investment in conventional long
range interdiction capability. Air to ground capability was designed
more to assist the ground battle and halt the advance of Warsaw Pact 
armour. In sum, the long period of the Cold War produced a force
structure in Europe that was designed for a short, high intensity
conflict, where air power assets, with the exception of nuclear
forces, were primarily defensive or in a support role. Air
strategists might articulate the arguments for interdiction and
offensive counter air campaigns, but in practice their best bombers
needed to be reserved against the potential need for early nuclear
options. </P>

<P>	While the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 could change the
security context in less than five years,  it is not  easy to
restructure the armed forces of Europe as quickly. Some changes in
balance were possible through the cuts that took place throughout
NATO nations in the early 90's. However, some of the reductions were
made  soon after the end of the Warsaw Pact, when it was still
thought possible for Russia to pose a threat in a relatively short
time. Thinking, as the 1991 NATO Strategic Concept  showed, still
looked primarily at maintaining a defensive posture, although with
significantly lower readiness for most forces. By the end of the
decade, three members of the Warsaw Pact (Hungary, Poland and the
Czech Republic) had become full members of NATO, while the rest,
including Russia, had become formal partners with the Alliance.
Russia was so weak that it was finding great difficulty in winning a
conventional war in Chechnya. Only her decaying nuclear weapon
arsenal remained as a potential residual threat to the security of
the rest of Europe. </P>

<P>	The UK Strategic Defence Review (SDR)  which was started in
1997 and was published in mid 1998 is a thoughtful analysis of the
security concerns of one European nation. It identified the positive
results from the collapse of Communism and the emergence of
democratic states throughout Europe. It stated that there was no
direct threat to Western Europe, and that none was foreseen, provided
that efforts were made to continue to promote and develop the
constructive relationships between all nations of Europe. On the
negative side, the SDR identified a number of new security risks. In
particular, it pointed to instability inside Europe, citing Bosnia
and Kosovo, as a threat to the UK's security. The SDR went on to say:
"Instability elsewhere - for example in Africa - may not always
appear to threaten us directly. But it can do indirectly, and we
cannot stand aside when it leads to massive human suffering." This
was the first statement of humanitarian intervention as a national
security driver. The Review also identified the growing threat from
proliferation of nuclear, biological and chemical technologies,
particularly from a number of hostile regimes. Finally, it reminded
the reader of the new risks to security from drugs, organised crime,
environmental degradation, terrorism and new information technology
vulnerabilities.</P>

<P>	The security threats as perceived by the UK were in line with
the general thrust of, and indeed helped to shape, European and NATO
thinking.  The successive crises in the Gulf, Bosnia, Kosovo and East
Timor have also had an effect on  political perceptions of the
utility of military force.  NATO decided to formulate a new Strategic
Concept, which would be launched at its 50th anniversary summit
meeting in April 1999 in Washington. As officials from member states
began drafting they drew on the recent experience in Bosnia, and were
already contemplating what might happen in Kosovo. The United States
was seeking to extend the NATO mandate  beyond its collective defence
remit. The concerns felt by some European nations changed as the
Kosovo crisis showed what this meant in practice. When the Washington
Summit took place, NATO found itself fighting a major air campaign
against Serbia and showing that it was prepared to intervene beyond
its national boundaries.</P>

<P>	The development of a coherent defence policy for the EU had
been an area of great difficulty for most of the 90's. The UK had
been particularly unhelpful, fearing that any enhancing of the EU's
role would be at the expense of NATO cohesion. The logjam was broken
by the Anglo-French summit at St Malo in December 1998. Despite
having predicated the just completed UK defence review on a
continuing NATO centred Atlanticist foreign policy, within six months
of its publication, Prime Minister Tony Blair was advocating a much
more significant  role for Europe. The St Malo Declaration made it
clear that: "the Union must have the capacity for autonomous action,
backed up by credible military forces, the means to decide to use
them, and a readiness to do so, in order to respond to international
crises" . The declaration went on to say:"In order for the European
Union to take decisions and approve military action where the
Alliance as a whole is not engaged, the Union must be given
appropriate structures and a capacity for analysis of situations,
sources of intelligence, and a capability for relevant strategic
planning, without unnecessary duplication, taking account of the
existing assets  of the WEU and the evolution of its relations with
the EU. In this regard, the European Union will also need to have
recourse to suitable military means (European capabilities
pre-designated within NATO's European pillar or national or
multinational European means outside the NATO framework).  This was a
radical change of position for the British and opened the way to the
further developments in 1999 in European defence. </P>

<P>	 The WEU summit in Bremen at the end of May 1999 took forward
the thinking that had started at St Malo and had been confirmed in
Washington. The apparently insurmountable difficulties of the
differences in membership between NATO, WEU and EU appeared to be no
longer a sticking point. They agreed that there was a "need for WEU
to be operationally effective with the involvement and participation
of all WEU nations in accordance with their status and to continue
its cooperation with the EU and NATO, in preparation for any new
arrangements which may be agreed in light of ongoing developments".
The Cologne European Council Declaration put it into a wider context,
but picked up the same points, when they  committed themselves in
paragraph 2 "to further develop more effective European military
capabilities from the basis of existing national, bi-national and
multinational capabilities and to strengthen our own capabilities for
that purpose. This requires the maintenance of a sustained defence
effort, the implementation of the necessary adaptations and notably
the reinforcement of our capabilities in the field of intelligence,
strategic transport, command and control."  It it is quite
significant that this was a declaration by all 15 members including
four 'neutral' countries.The Anglo-Italian declaration of 20 July has
 produced some concrete proposals on what needs to be done.  It has
rightly widened the requirement from a need for an EU  capacity for
doing its own humanitarian, crisis management and peace support
operations (the Petersberg tasks).  The need for a more effective
European role in NATO is promoted as a clear lesson from Kosovo. The
declaration seeks  to develop a timetable to achieve European-wide
goals for enhanced military capabilities, and a set of national
capability objectives to achieve this European requirement. Finally
last week's anglo-french summit pushed forward the idea of a European
rapid reaction force with full air capabilities.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	We have now, in theory, an outline plan for progress in
improving European defence capabilities in a way which works with the
grain of NATO. That is a remarkable step forward given the reluctance
of the US and the UK in past years to address these issues. But there
are many difficulties ahead. NATO would claim to have a planning
process, and to have expended much effort over the years on coercing
nations into setting more challenging force goals for themselves</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>How is European air power configured to meet it?</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	In order to look at the air power capabilities that the
European Union nations should field, we need to make some assumptions
about the scale of effort that it would be appropriate for the EU to
seek to provide. The EU and the US are just about equal in terms of
absolute wealth. The EU is more populous and has more potential
conflicts in its backyard than the US. However, the US has formal
security obligations in Japan and Korea as well as in Europe. Taking
all these factors into account, it might seem a reasonable initial
benchmark for European nations to contribute a usable military
capability to NATO of the same order of magnitude as the United
States does  today. The United States plans to generated ten air
expeditionary wings, each with about 15,000 personnel and 200
aircraft. Certainly Europe would not need to aim for any greater
capability than this. This would not be a recipe for duplication, but
a significant challenge for Europe. It would make the Europeans equal
partners when operating within NATO, and would ensure a capability
for operations on a European basis when necessary. In theory is
should be easily affordable given that the EU nations spend 64% of
the amount that the USA does on defence. In practice, it would
require massive restructuring of the way military forces are provided
within Europe.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	The UK Government has taken this as a strong lesson of the
Kosovo operation:</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>...... in co-operation with our Allies,
we need to examine ways in which member states can increase their
qualitative and quantitative military contribution to NATO's overall
capabilities. The   priority lies in such areas as precision attack
weapons, secure communications and strategic  movement assets.
Interoperability of systems will, of course, be a key component of
this.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	The key elements for early work in improving European
capability are contained in this analysis. Readiness, deployability
and sustainability are identified as prime drivers for force
structures. Precision attack weapons, secure communications and
strategic  movement assets are highlighted as areas for priority
work. There are significant implications for air power in all of
these six issues.  Europe needs to completely restructure its
expensive, but unusable, military capability to meet these
challenges. While the focus of this volume is on air power issues, it
is impossible to look at air power in isolation. The funds provided
for defence purposes throughout Europe are unlikely to increase
without a significant change in threat perception. This means that
restructuring of capabilities will need to be achieved within broadly
the same resource assumptions as today. Thus, a balance will need to
be struck between the different elements of the joint force
structure. Nevertheless, it is possible to start by making an initial
unconstrained assessment of what air power assets Europe should be
able to deploy, and then assess how they might fit into the resource
priorities.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>A Theoretical European Air Power Capability</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Using the Kosovo  campaign as a benchmark for a modern military
operation which should be within the capability of European nations,
we can break out the scale of effort that might be needed in future.
The campaign needed to be able to call upon the traditional mix of
air defence fighters, bombers, close air support,  reconnaissance,
airborne early warning, air-to-air refuelling, strategic airlift,
tactical fixed wing and rotary transport capabilities. Although the
maritime aspects of the operation were limited, it must be assumed
that future campaigns might need the appropriate mix of maritime
reconnaissance, air defence, attack and anti-submarine warfare air
assets.  </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	The EU nations together have elements of all of these air power
capabilities. They field some 3235 combat aircraft with a total air
force manpower of 380,000. If the NATO non-EU members are added
(Czech Republic, Hungary, Iceland, Norway, Poland and Turkey) the
numbers rise to 4281 combat aircraft and 530,000 men. These large air
power assets  are however balanced to provide the defensive posture
that was appropriate to the static defence requirements of the Cold
War. All  forces have a strong air defence element reflecting the
requirement to defend their own territory. While many of the fighters
can be used in a bombing role, they are not all weather capable and
aircrew will not have undertaken primary training in this role. For
offensive air operations, the only EU nations with  a significant
capability  are France, Germany, Italy and the UK, who can field
around 500 aircraft in an all weather bombing mode. Looking at the
scale of offensive air capability needed for the Gulf and Kosovo,
Europe needs to work at providing perhaps 50% more all weather
bombers than it can at present. This is an achievable aim if the
excess of air defence fighters is given up.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	However, the platform is only part of the question in modern
air campaigns. It has become very clear that in future operations,
precision weapons will be the norm. Figures for weapons stocks are
not readily available, but inferences can be drawn from the data of
weapon usage in the Kosovo air campaign. If the US is to be matched,
it seems that the only way to do it is by pooling and operating air
power at the European level. We have a model in NATO AWACs which
could be extended into various elements of our activities. The
supporting activities are probably the easiest ones.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Air Support</H3>

<P>What capability does Europe need which it could operate on a
similar basis to NATO AWACS? Airlift is an obvious example. If forces
are to be deployed rapidly, they need to be able to call on a
significant airlift capability. Pooling of some of the widely used
C130 Hercules could provide an immediate European tactical fixed wing
transport  capability. Provided that nations structured their
contributions sensibly, they could make operating cost savings at the
national level through closure of bases, training units, and
headquarters. The level of saving would depend on the degree to which
each nation felt able to rely on the supporting infrastructure being
provided by a European facility. Some ten EU nations operate  C130
aircraft. It would be possible to imagine a pooled fleet of 60
aircraft, which would look after all the national  C130 needs of 
Belgium (who operate 11), Denmark (4), Italy (10), Netherlands (2),
Spain (12)  and Portugal (6). France with 14  C130s and the UK with
55 have larger  transport aircraft fleets; and they could provide a
partial contribution  of perhaps 4 and 10 aircraft respectively to
the pooled arrangement. Greece (15  C130s) and Sweden  (8) would
probably choose not to depend on pooled aircraft. For those nations
that were prepared to put their whole C130 fleets into a common pool,
there would be significant savings in operating costs, and they would
also have a much better assurance of availability on a day to day
basis. For Europe there would be a usable airlift capability for
humanitarian operations as well as for use within NATO. Over time,
the management and operation of this common fleet would lead to a
common perception among participating nations of the characteristics
of the next generation transport aircraft. The extra costs of
operating on a national basis rather than a pooled basis would also
become clear, and it is likely that nations would begin to see the
advantages of contributing to such a force element.  </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In a similar way, the requirement for a large strategic airlift
capability could be tackled. The operation of such a fleet could
easily be managed by the same organisation that would look after the
tactical C130 pooled capability. It would be possible to procure a
new capability of C17s or Antonov strategic transport aircraft that
could either be operated by the military or on a leased basis from a
cmmercila company. In either case the costs would be lower than each
nation trying to operate a very small fleet of large and expensive
aircraft.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Air to air refuelling capability is also needed by all European
air forces, and would be a natural candidate for a European fleet
operation. There is consideration being given to procuring the Uk air
to air refuelling capability through a public private partnership
arrangement. This would be particularly easy to enlarge to encompass
those nations in Europe which sought such a facility. The economics
of the operation would improve for the larger fleet and there would
be no sovreignty issues to worry about given the service is being
provided by the private sector.It is possible to draw up similar
proposals for transport helicopters, although care must be taken to
ensure that sufficient assets are based within easy flying range of
their normal tasking. This will tend to require dispersed deployments
and the efficiencies from pooling short range assets will therefore
be less.  None of the air transport or air tanker proposals would
undermine national capability. Indeed for the smaller nations it
would both increase available capability and reduce costs. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Combat Power </H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The concept can be extended to front-line combat aircraft,
although sensitivities about national capability will be greater. The
introduction into service of Eurofighter from 2002 to five European
nations (UK, Germany, Italy, Spain and Greece) offers a  good
opportunity to enhance capabilities and reduce costs through pooling
of  assets. Sharing training, engineering, logistic, and operational
planning facilities would throw up significant operating cost
savings. These would be greatly increased if the number of operating
bases could be reduced as a result. Most importantly common fleet
management would play a vital role in retaining system configuration
control so that all Eurofighters remain fully interoperable. From a
political viewpoint, if as a result Europe were able to offer a force
of 500  of the most modern combat aircraft for future NATO
operations, it would be a capability contributor more equal to the
United States. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Conclusion</H3>

<P>The last decade has shown that the United States is now operating
a quite different level of capability from anyone else in the world.
If we wish to operate in alliance, we must follow the US air power
doctrine. It appears that Europe in general, and the UK government in
particular, is not happy about this state of affairs. To become a
more equal partner with the US in NATO, nations are going to have to
restructure their air forces significantly. Money is not the problem,
but small air forces with all the support overhead are a problem.
Either Europe starts merging its airpower, or it must leave it all to
the United States.</P>
