			<h3>Britain and Son of Star Wars </h3>

			<p>As far as the Bush plans for missile defence are concerned, Tony Blair would have preferred to keep the issue off the agenda until after the election. The focus of the new US administration on a re-run of the Reagan Star Wars project was no surprise. While the discussion last year was of a scheme to protect the United States from the threat of nuclear blackmail by North Korea, Iran and Iraq, President Bush&#146;s speech may have hinted at a larger long term aim. Ultimately, he seemed to seek to protect the US and its allies from the rest of the world. <br>
				<br>
				The British government finds itself in a difficult position. First the scientific advice from the defence research officials makes it clear that the project is technically very suspect. The offensive in the nuclear missile business continues to have a significant advantage over any proposed defence. It could therefore be argued that since it will probably not work, why get so excited? Unfortunately, even the plans for developing such a system have some real security consequences. For Britain this will mean deciding whether to allow a physical and software upgrade to Fylingdales, and probably just a software change at Menwith Hill. Both of these changes would be in contravention of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty as currently agreed. They would involve extra-territorial detection systems in an area defensive arrangement for United States national territory. Given the UK&#146;s attachment to international law, it would seem unlikely that we could agree to an installation which contravened an agreed treaty. However, the ABM treaty also allows for the withdrawal by either party from the treaty at six months notice. While the Blair government would prefer the US to negotiate an appropriate change to the treaty provisions, it will have a more difficult judgement to make if the US announces that it intends to withdraw unilaterally. <br>
				<br>
				The next problem is with European allies. Both France and Germany are unenthusiastic about the security and arms control implications of missile defences. There seems little hope of trying to establish a EU common position on the issue. However, the EU has shown itself willing to take a different line on North Korea from the USA. The EU delegation with President Perrson and Commissioner Patten was in North Korea as George W.Bush was making his Star Wars speech to the nation. European nations are also much more concerned with engagement in Iran, where they see the emergence of more democratic institutions. Even over Iraq, there are transatlantic differences about the best approach. So fulsome endorsement of missile defence by Tony Blair would be characterised in Europe as yet another example of the UK being more interested in its relationship with the US than with the EU. <br>
				<br>
				The third difficulty for the British government is a financial one. There is no doubt that one of the major driving forces for missile defences is the US defence industry. The technologies are exciting and the budget is virtually limitless. No other nation will be a competitor in this market, and any price tag can be attached. If Tony Blair signs up to the threat from rogue states and the need to be included in the US missile defence arrangement, he will also be signing up to contributing to the costs. Although it could be argued that the protection of Fylingdales would be a necessary component of the defence of North America, it is clear that Britain will be expected to pay for any extension of the defensive umbrella. At a time when funding of the UK Strategic Defence Review capability (which has no provision for long-range ballistic missile defences) is looking unsustainable, this is an extra worry. <br>
				<br>
				So what is the best strategy for Blair and Hoon? Play it long and hope something helpful turns up. It seems clear that the Prime Minister has assured President Bush privately that the UK will be on side when needed; and hence Alistair Campbell&#146;s unfortunate briefing of the press. Officials will make it clear to their US counterparts that the negotiations with the Russians need to be undertaken seriously. At the same time the intelligence community will be reminding Robin Cook of the importance of not upsetting their very special relationship with the US. <br>
				<br>
				In ten year&#146;s time, there will be a different President in the White House. He will be able to explain why missile defences came to nothing yet again. The US defence industries will have done better than they deserved, and the European industries will wring their hands. There will still be more nuclear weapons around the world than anyone needs. Korea may be unified. Iran may be the exemplar for democracy in Islamic states. Iraq may still be being contained roughly be an uneasy alliance of its neighbours and the West. The real question is whether China will have changed its priority from economic to military regeneration because of fear of the USA. All of this is an example of how sometimes policy options are pretty limited, and how none of them may very attractive.<br>
