					Indiana University 19 February 2004</font></address>
		</div>
		<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">It is a great pleasure to return to Indiana University and here to Bloomington. I have felt linked through the regular video conference lectures that I have done. However,  it is almost three years to the day, when I was last giving a public lecture here. Then I took as my theme,  International Security in the New Century. None of us I think could have seen what a step change there would be later that year of 2001 in the way we thought about our security. In my introduction then I said: </font></p>
		<address><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Forecasting what the world is going to be like in this new century is an uncertain art. Unfortunately, crises, both natural and manmade, emerge so rapidly that predictions are upset almost as soon as they are made.</font></address>
		<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Since then, we have all come to know what fanatical terrorists, who care nothing for either their own lives or those of their victims, can do to damage us and our interests. We have fought two wars, first in Afghanistan and next in Iraq. We have seen greater strains in the relationships between the old friends across the Atlantic than for nearly half a century. And we continue to see our troops injured and dying as they try to rebuild nations in the Middle East, Asia, Africa and still in Europe.<br>
				<br>
				I do not intend to repeat my analysis of three years ago &#150; you can listen to it on the IU website if you wish &#150; but I was pleased when I re-read it to feel there is nothing that I would wish to change now with the benefit of hindsight. There is of course much to add, given the extraordinary events of these last 3 years. As I look at the implications of these new security challenges for our national and international approaches on both sides of the Atlantic, I would echo my cautionary words of last time: <i>&quot;Predicting the future is always a somewhat hazardous affair.&quot;</i></font></p>
		<h3><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Events of the past 3 years </font></h3>
		<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">I returned to the UK from Indiana in Spring 2001 to the range of security concerns that keep commentators and academics in the strategic studies field in business. The Israel-Palestine situation was spiralling down,  Macedonia in the Balkans was looking flaky, worries about proliferation associated with North Korea, Iraq and Iran continued. India - Pakistan was concerning.  Nor were transatlantic relationships in very good shape. Disputes over Kyoto, the International Criminal Court, trade,  and arms control were all causing friction. The new Bush team had a style of diplomacy that was taking a while to get used to in Europe. <br>
				<br>
				And then on 11 September, all our worlds changed. The suicide bomber was not new &#150; but the fanatical terrorist conducting a long planned complex co-ordinated attack against a major western country &#150; the major western power &#150; that was outside all experience.  Western societies are extremely vulnerable to such tactics. We depend on a technological infrastructure to support our way of life. A box cutter becomes a weapon of mass destruction when it enables a terrorist to use a fuel-laden jumbo jet as a cruise missile to attack a building which houses thousands of people. <br>
				<br>
				The universal  European reaction to those attacks was one of sympathy for America, and horror at the outrage. Indeed many countries around the world lost citizens in the World Trade Center destruction. In France, Le Monde led with the headline that  &quot;we are all Americans now&quot;. The bickering across the Atlantic was quieted. NATO invoked Article V (an attack on one is an attack on all) for the first time in its history on 12 September 2001. The world waited to see how the US would respond. Al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden achieved worldwide coverage. Not always negative in some parts of the world, it should be said. The academic debate on how a nation dealt with a non-state actor able to threaten a massively destructive attack became all too real. </font></p>
		<h3><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Afghanistan</font></h3>
		<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The US response was thoughtful, constrained and appropriate as seen from Europe. Al-Qaeda had trained thousands of its followers in camps in Afghanistan, and the Taliban rulers of that country had supported and been supported by bin Laden. It was understandable perhaps that President Bush wanted  the retribution in Afghanistan to be a US rather than NATO operation. However,  there has been a price to pay for not using the Alliance when it was ready and willing. Of course allies did help in Afghanistan. The UK provide a great deal of air effort in the tanking, reconnaissance and signals intelligence field. But that was provided on a bilateral arrangement, that seems now to have become the norm for US-led military action. This has implications for the future of NATO to which I shall return. NATO's only significant role was to provide its AWACs early warning aircraft to protect US skies against further 9/11 style attacks. <br>
				<br>
				And after al-Qaeda had been largely routed and the Taliban displaced, there was the challenge of rebuilding Afghanistan into a modern functioning democracy.  The approach was sound and had universal support. A UN authorised constitutional process gave a clear path to producing a representative democracy. There was a charismatic widely accepted leadership figure in Hamad Karzai who could oversee the process. Early on he asked for assistance from the world to provide security in his war torn country, full of different ethnic groups, warlords and criminals. He said he needed an international force of 50,000 to provide the rule of law throughout the country. We, the non US members of NATO, provided only 5000 in Kabul, and as the months passed it became even more difficult to get countries to take on the leadership of this small force. <br>
				<br>
				Subsequently NATO has come to the rescue, but not with many more troops. The US continued, with some allies, warfighting &#150; as it does to this day in Afghanistan; while the Europeans picked up the peacekeeping side of the equation. So in Afghanistan, we had the right response to the 9/11 terror attacks, but have lacked the will to support the political process that could have made Afghanistan a more stable region. Instead, the opium crop is flourishing, the Taliban are reasserting themselves, and al-Qaeda operates more freely across the border with Pakistan.</font></p>
		<h3><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Counter-terrorism</font></h3>
		<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">With the Taliban gone, the US and Europe diverged in their approach to the new terror threat. The extraordinary energy and resources that went into all aspects  of Homeland Security is understood in Europe, but has not been followed. It may be that Europe is more complacent or stoic. Most European countries have had their own terrorist problems in recent years, and all (except Switzerland)  have suffered devastation in conventional wars in the last century. Guantanamo Bay has been a source of great disquiet to all of Europe including the UK. It could be argued that Europe has been overly complacent in the protective measures that nations have taken. However,  the European Union has done some really effective co-operation in border control, sharing of intelligence, and co-operation in bringing terrorists to justice. Where the big difference has come is in the perceptions on how to deal with the new security challenges.<br>
				<br>
				The &quot;war on terror&quot; has not been a phrase with much resonance in Europe. All our previous experience in counter-terrorism has made us wary of adopting simple offensive strategies. President Bush's axis of evil speech, naming Iraq, Iran and North Korea, followed later in 2002 by the new US national security strategy left many in Europe worried by the new direction that the world's only superpower was taking. Pre-emption of emerging threats, as postulated in the new US strategy, seemed to be calling into question the whole international system. </font></p>
		<h3><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Iraq</font></h3>
		<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">And then Iraq. I will not rehearse all the arguments over the military operation in Iraq in March 2003. Whatever the merits or otherwise,  it was a period of incompetent diplomacy and dirty politics on all sides which led to divisions across the Atlantic and within Europe. Even within nations, opinions were divided and not necessarily along political lines. I should make it clear that I argued strongly and publicly against the rush to war. Yet as far as I was concerned when the UK Parliament voted to authorise military action, and our Attorney General ruled it a legal intervention,  I was able to support the actual operation as it was carried out. And the way it was carried out brings great credit on the professionalism of the US, UK and Australian forces involved. <br>
				<br>
				The United States was impatient for decisive action; the United Kingdom wanted UN authority for military action; Germany and France led the call for more time for the inspection process. The attempt to achieve a further resolution to give authority for military action was unsuccessful. Hard bargaining by the US failed to achieve the necessary 9 votes, and in any event it was clear that France would exercise a veto if necessary. The US and UK opted to use UNSCR 1441, and previous resolutions on Iraq, as their authority for military action. <br>
				<br>
				This failure of diplomacy has had a series of unfortunate consequences. In the USA, antipathy towards the UN increased. Although unexpected countries like Canada and Mexico had taken a tough stand in the Security Council, the real anger was directed at France and Germany. Both American and British politicians chose to use anti-French feelings in the run up to the conflict as a way to deflect public interest from the issue of whether military action was legitimate. Russia also remained unconvinced by the rush to war. Of course, questions about the legitimacy of the intervention are now increasing as the weapons of mass destruction continue to prove elusive.</font></p>
		<h3><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The European Union</font></h3>
		<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">While leaders were falling out in New York, the European Union managed to have a more refined dispute. The Greek Presidency, Javier Solana and Chris Patten had all made clear the EU's support for a diplomatic rather than early military solution to Iraq. Yet the embryonic common foreign and security policy mechanism could do little to paper over the wide division between its members. Governments (if not their people) in UK, Spain, Italy, Denmark and Portugal were strongly supportive of the US push for military action. At the end of January 2003, their leaders, together with those of Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland, signed a joint note for the Wall Street Journal expressing their unity.  France, Germany, and Belgium were strongly against a rush to war. In a more complex set of divisions, the prospective new members of the EU were brought into the dispute. This gave rise to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's unfortunate characterisation of a division between &quot;Old Europe&quot;, represented by France and Germany, and &quot;New Europe&quot; drawn from  grateful eastern European states.  President Chirac added fuel to the flames by suggesting that pro-US candidate countries were &quot;badly brought up&quot;, and hinting that their EU membership applications might need reviewing.<br>
				<br>
				EU optimists hope that the crisis over Iraq policy will promote a greater push for developments towards coherent European foreign policy positions. Some small hopeful signs emerged even during this turbulent period. The EU took over the modest but important task in Macedonia from NATO on 1 April 2003. If this goes well, there is an expectation in the longer term that the EU will progressively take on the Balkans task. Despite the megaphone diplomacy between the UK and France over Iraq, some reinforcement of their joint push for a more serious European defence capability has been seen. Indeed Blair, Chirac and Schroder are meeting today in Berlin to look at how they might give some joint leadership.</font></p>
		<h3><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">NATO </font></h3>
		<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The diplomatic machinations over Iraq were also bruising for NATO. Afghanistan had shown the future: the US expects to lead coalitions of the willing. In any event, there would have been little chance of consensus among member states over mounting a NATO operation. Even with  a sidelined role, the divisions between the various national players managed to cause excitement. NATO found itself in difficulties over authorisation for planning for the defence of Turkey in the event of a conflict in Iraq. The diplomatic temperature rose as France, Germany and Belgium saw themselves being pressured into giving a stamp of approval for US early moves on Iraq. To general surprise, Turkey in the end did not allow ground operations to be launched against Iraq from its territory. There were no attacks by Iraq on Turkey. Nevertheless, the concern in NATO was real, and the public name calling between members was undoubtedly damaging.<br>
				<br>
				While injured feelings will doubtless heal with time, Iraq reinforced questions about the future relevance of NATO. The Alliance has had a remarkable success over the past decade in the way that it has stabilised the Balkans. It has also done great work in its programme of enlargement, which has brought greater stability to Europe.  At Prague in late 2002, the commitments by member states to a new NATO Response Force seemed to be accepting that the Alliance needed to be able to spearhead high intensity operations in distant parts at short notice. NATO is already working well beyond its traditional area of  interest.<br>
				<br>
				There remains a tension between the practice of deploying NATO on post-conflict tasks, and the rhetoric of successive Alliance summits, which look for the most modern warfighting capabilities. Some suspect that the US sees NATO as a useful forum to encourage individual members to update  capabilities. This then allows coalitions of the willing to be built through bi-lateral arrangements. The NATO role becomes little more than setting equipment standards and sharing military doctrine. The lessons from the Iraq conflict of 2003 will undoubtedly reinforce the importance of precision weaponry and network centric warfare. Yet investment in these capabilities may be at the expense of the troops that are proving so vital after the fighting is over.</font></p>
		<h3><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Post Conflict Iraq</font></h3>
		<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The mistakes that have been made in the post conflict period in Iraq have not helped. Whatever view one held about the war, getting Iraq functioning as a normal country is the most important current challenge. It effects stability in the region and also the wide worries about growing al-Qaeda support. However,  the UN must have a major role in legitimising whatever  form of government emerges in Iraq. Despite setbacks, particularly the tragic death of Sergo Vieira  de Mello, there are signs of progress in re-introducing the UN into the Iraq constitutional and political process. Yet none of us should underestimate the challenge that lies ahead in making Iraq a model democracy for the region.</font></p>
		<h3><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Future Paths </font></h3>
		<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">As tempers cool, political leaders will need to work at rebuilding the key international institutions. The UN has many tasks, and has survived previous spats. It will have to become re-engaged in Iraq. We cannot ignore Israel-Palestine, North Korea, and many other nascent problems particularly in Africa. The EU also has more to bind it together than just foreign and security policy. It has much work to do on its own programme of enlargement. Yet, it cannot put off for ever the development of a coherent approach to international action. It knows that it is only as a regional actor can it expect to be taken seriously by the United States. What the EU still has to decide is whether it wants to work at the hard power end of the spectrum. At the meeting of EU foreign ministers in Greece on 2 May 2003, there was encouraging support for the idea that Javier Solana should begin the development of a security doctrine. A new document was agreed in Brussels by all EU members at the end of last year. It started by saying about the enlarged Europe: <br>
				<br>
				As a union of 25 states with over 450 million people producing a quarter of the world&#146;s GNP, the European Union is inevitably a global player .. it should be ready to share in the responsibility for global security and in building a better world.<br>
				<br>
				Without new thinking on strategy, collective EU defence efforts will at best remain focused on the conflict prevention tasks. Some nations will continue to want to be able to  project military power independently or as contributors to transitory coalitions. NATO may then have greater difficulty with its own role. If it is not needed for intervention operations like Afghanistan or Iraq, then initiatives to generate modern warfighting capabilities will seem less urgent. After its success in the Balkans, its future may come to be seen as more concerned with post-conflict security work than in tasks appropriate to a NATO Response Force. <br>
				<br>
				I fear such a division of labour across the Atlantic, which would broadly find Europe cleaning up after US interventions. Without some serious strategic thinking by the EU and NATO, this may be the outcome. The US with a  few allies  would produce the hard warfighting capability when needed (and preferably when asked for by the UN); NATO  would provide a ready peace enforcement force for immediate post-conflict problems; and the EU would be left to police and rebuild civil society. A more balanced sharing of global security responsibilities must be a better route. If the EU develops its new strategic concept to include the use of hard power, then it can work with NATO to ensure that the US is not left to police the world on its own.</font></p>
		<h3><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Future of International Security</font></h3>
		<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">At the heart of our transatlantic debate, is the still unanswered question of how best to meet the new security challenges. There is a fair degree of agreement between the US and Europe on the most important ones in the wider sense of global security. Despite the tremendous successes of recent years in moving towards more democratic states, there remain parts of the world where either government is not functioning, or where totalitarian regimes still hold sway. At the same time, there is the growing threat from those who owe no allegiance to any state, but operate outside the rule of law, and can use terror as their weapon. <br>
				<br>
				We face problems of international crime; of corruption which undermines democracy; of poverty in much of the world; of declining natural resources be it fish, oil or water; of environmental damage of which global warming is the most acute; of population growths in poorly governed regions; and of disease returning and spreading through global travel. <br>
				<br>
				Some of these factors make conflict more likely, and all of them need concerted action by the global community. Europe remains less effective when trying to meet the challenges at the hard end of security. These challenges come from undemocratic states developing powerful new weapons, with which they hope to deter intervention by the international community. They also come from extremists who combine a willingness to die for their cause, with a wish to maximise the terror and destruction on their enemies. And, they come from the strife within weak countries, which can lead to mass refugees, who look for help from the rich nations of the world.  The US could do more at the softer end of security. Neither approach on its own can make us safer. <br>
				<br>
				The international system is imperfect, but it is important. We need to re-establish the trust between Europe and the US after a very bruising period so that we can work together &#150; old friends and new friends &#150; to make the world a better place.<br>
