			<p>The Fallujah operation was thankfully&nbsp; relatively quick. No army relishes the prospect of urban warfare, where every corner can hide a sniper, and every door may be booby-trapped. The overwhelming US power both in the air and on the ground swept through this ghost town, which was normally home to more than quarter of a million people. As usual, while every American deaths is reported, we have only guesses for Iraqi casualties. Reports range from 1000 to 2000 Iraqi dead, and a further 1000 captured and detained. Their injured are uncounted. Even if all those killed or captured were insurgents, they represent only half the number thought to be holed up in Fallujah, and a smaller fraction of the 12-16,000 &quot;core insurgents&quot; which the US intelligence reports. Certainly, the expected violent eruptions in other cities came, and Mosul was particularly badly affected.</p>
			<p>What happens now? The residents of Fallujah will emerge from their basements, or trickle back from their country cousins, to try to put their lives together again. The US military has made clear that its strategy is to rebuild the infrastructure and ensure security. This is certainly the right approach, but is not going to be easy. Despite some assistance from Iraqi security forces,&nbsp; the US forces remain thinly stretched and overtasked. The ruthless sweep through Fallujah has increased the widespread animosity to what are universally seen as occupation forces. Tensions in the Iraqi Interim Government have surfaced with the President disagreeing with the Prime Minister over the Fallujah operation. More mixed messages are emerging over whether the January elections will be either practical or sensible.</p>
			<p>As the media circus moves on, we begin to lose sight of the continuing levels of violence.&nbsp; The kidnapping, captivity and probable death of Margaret Hassan made the headlines in Britain. Yet it was much less covered by Iraqi media given that some 160 foreigners and thousands of Iraqis have been taken hostage. It also reflects the deepening suspicion of all foreigners and of aid agencies among the mass of the Iraqi population. This trend makes the reconstruction task yet more difficult, and in a vicious spiral increases the support for insurgency.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>As the election date for the transitional authority approaches, there are some difficult choices. Registration in the Kurdish north is going well. The Kurds realise that a united front during the development of the new constitution&nbsp; is key to their retaining the semi-autonomy that they have enjoyed for so long. In the rest of the country, security for voter registration remains largely inadequate. Those brave individuals who put themselves forward for election become targets. Ordinary Iraqis who queue outside government buildings are vulnerable to car bombs. Nor is it likely that the security situation will be sufficiently&nbsp; under control to allow international monitoring of the elections. Now that there is a formal State of Emergency, the normal political process becomes even more problematic.</p>
			<p>What does all this mean for Britain? There are signs that the UK Government has realised that deployment of the Black Watch was unwise, and has left us vulnerable to uncontrolled mission creep. As our courageous soldiers provide daily target practice for insurgent mortars into Camp Dogwood, they will be looking forward to their promised return home before Christmas. Future army deployments must only be within the British sector, and be designed to provide the necessary security for the electoral process to go ahead in the South. If the Shia majority come to believe that they are going to be cheated of their elections, then we may find that Ayatollah al Sistani's restraining influence will not hold. There is still a job for us to do, but we must focus on the aim of handing back Iraq to its people.<b></b></p>
