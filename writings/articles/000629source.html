<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Although the MOD was a leading department in
the move towards contracting out government business to private
industry, there are a number of difficult privatisation issues
bubbling away at the moment in the Defence area. The much delayed
proposals for privatisation of the Defence Evaluation and Research
Agency (DERA) received a drubbing from the Defence Select Committee
at the end of June. An exciting venture into providing air-to-air
refuelling for the RAF from a commercial company is taking longer
than expected to come to fruition. The cost of the PFI venture into
modernising the MOD headquarters in Whitehall has attracted some
surprise. Finally, the privatisation of the National Air Traffic
Service (NATS) has implications for defence aviation as well as the
civil operators. Is this just some politically difficult PFI/PPP
projects attracting attention, or is there a common thread?</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The announced proposal for DERA is that it
should be split into two unequal parts. The greater, more commercial,
part will become known as NewDERA and will become a separate private
sector  concern, perhaps by market flotation, with the Government
retaining a golden share. The core MOD business, such as Porton Down,
will be kept within a small organisation to be known as Retained
DERA. The Defence Select Committee report was unimpressed by the
value for money implications and concluded that: </FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">the potential
benefits of a partial privatisation remain to be convincingly
demonstrated by the MoD. In our judgement the current risks of
proceeding with the public-private partnership&emdash;even in its new
and improved format&emdash;continue to outweigh the still
hypothetical benefits.</FONT></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">They believe that the pressure to realise
the assumed money from the sale has outweighed a proper judgement.
Perhaps one of the biggest problems will be attracting any staff to
stay in the Retained DERA organisation given the likely pay
differentials. Certainly it is going to offer a somewhat limited
career for the scientists who currently work there and have highly
marketable skills. Some appear to be on the move already.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The proposal to look at a PFI private sector
approach to the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft (FSTA) for the RAF
is a bold step. Many in the military are anxious about the
implications of privatising such a front-line activity. The aircrew
and immediate supporting staff will need to be in uniform for
operations, and a new form of Reservist (the Sponsored Reserve) may
be necessary. From the private sector's view, the difficulties of
using spare capacity under civil rules have yet to be sorted out.
However, the major unspoken worry may be a similar one to the DERA
problem. If aircrew and groundcrew receive big rewards to operate as
civilians in a military environment, what will this mean for
retention in the RAF?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The refurbishment of the Ministry of Defence
Main Building is probably some 20 years overdue. PFI seemed to offer
an opportunity to reduce the political sensitivity of "them up there"
feathering their own nests while the troops had inadequate guns in
Kosovo. However the rising costs, and the global figure that attaches
to these long term arrangements can cause more harm than good. Again,
the political fall out may be in adverse morale to those who do not
benefit.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Finally, the MOD has an interest, which is
not much publicised, in how the privatisation of NATS is implemented.
Much of the airspace over the United Kingdom is military rather than
civil. The MOD makes a sizeable contribution to the costs and
management of the system. They have an interest in a well managed and
safe arrangement which allows military air training and exercises to
continue. The ownership of the system is probably not a key issue,
and better value for money would certainly be helpful. There will
however be a concern that the balance that has been struck between
the civil and military needs may be at risk in the longer term. If
commercial interests dominate, then the military voice may carry less
weight. Nevertheless, the poor management of the development of the
new air traffic system has been a long term cause for concern as 
Defence money has been wasted on a system which has little hope of
coming into service. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">These four (and there are others) examples
of current Defence privatisation issues show that there are many
concerns. Yet the evidence has been that the move to privatisation
has been good for defence capability. At the top in MOD, this is well
understood.  Elsewhere doubts remain. In the end, the move of tasks
away from MOD owned establishments are likely to reduce career
opportunities and continue the drift away from the Services and the
Civil Service. This trend is likely to require costly measures to
rectify in the longer term. However, the money saved from such moves
is now an essential and important part of the Defence budget.</FONT>
