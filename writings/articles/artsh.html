<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=5>1994: The Tide of World Events on the
Turn?</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>Air Marshal Sir Timothy Garden, Commandant RCDS</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Each year the senior military, civil servants, diplomats, police
and industrialists, who attend the Royal College of Defence Studies,
examine the trends in international security. Inevitably views of
future prospects are coloured by topical events. Last year was full
of mixed signals. Events in the Former Republic of Yugoslavia and
Rwanda gave little cause for optimism. Yet there were other
indicators of the triumph of rational behaviour: in South Africa, in
the Middle East and in Northern Ireland.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>As one part of the Course each of the Members writes a short
research paper on a topic of his or her choice. The collection which
follows is a small selection of the over 70 papers which were
produced. This selection is representative of the range of the areas
covered, and reflects the issues which surfaced during the year.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>The International Scene in 1994</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Much of the year was spent in examining the world as it has
developed in the aftermath of the Cold War. The mood of triumphalism
has virtually disappeared. One consequence of the end of this period
of statis has been the growth of local conflicts: old scores to be
settled, ethnic and racial disputes, economic tensions, and sheer
brigandry. The disintegration of the former Yugoslavia has been the
most visible, but within the former Soviet Union there has been, and
increasingly will be, potential flash points for conflict.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In his piece asking the question A Future for Democracy?, Ian
McEwen examines the state of health of modern liberal democracy in
this new world. In a compelling sequence of argument, he concludes
that "as we watch external events unfold and successive surveys tick
off the collapse of dictatorships around the world, we are in danger
of placing too much uncritical trust in the propaganda stemming from
our own perspective of democracy as a self-evident virtue".</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>Europe and America</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In studying each area of the world in detail, the Course looked at
the prospects for democracy, and the different models that were
developing. The future developments in Europe were a key concern, not
only to the European members, but to all the nations represented,
given the world-wide influence of European economic and security
structures. The question of enlargement in both a European Union and
a NATO context was never far from the surface. The role of NATO in
the future, and its relationship to the WEU, CSCE and a European
Defence Identity, was also a key issue.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The continuing conflict in the Former Republic of Yugoslavia was a
backdrop to discussion throughout 1994. The countries of the former
Soviet Union were also suffering difficulties in the transition, and
new conflicts were becoming evident. Austin Thorp in his Perspectives
of Europe brings all these issues together in a novel and telling
way. He describes the grand strategic view from Paris, Berlin,
Moscow, Kiev, Ankara and London. He adds in regional perspectives
from Northern, Central and Southern Europe, and distils the all
important view from Washington. He concludes that there are enough
risks and dangers abroad to warrant a greater collective investment
in the future of Europe.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>For future stability in Europe, as in so much of the rest of the
world, the part which the United States of America is willing to play
is a key factor. The United Nations had a mixed year with success in
the purely humanitarian or monitoring operations, but more criticism
in the highly visible higher intensity operations. At times, this was
characterised as a difference between the UN and NATO, or between the
UN and the USA. The experience in Somalia and the differences of
opinion over operations in Bosnia led to increased debate over the
willingness of the United States to act as the world's policeman.
Larry Miller examines whether his country is moving away from
involvement in world affairs in his Neo-Isolationism in Post Cold War
America. He concludes that the question is not whether the US will
retrench and become more isolationist, but rather will any good come
from this. Among a number of interesting consequences, he also
deduces that Europe will require a strong union for its future
security.</P>

<P><B>The Middle East</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Looking beyond Europe and the United States, stability in the
Middle East was a focus for continuing interest. The year saw Iraq
still prepared to risk a military response from the West. However,
the rapid development of the peace process between Israel and the
Palestinians was the key event of the year. The Course included
military men from Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman and the United
Arab Emirates, who all contributed to the debate. From this historic
development, there was great hope that a new era of peace and
economic development could flow. Yet, there was concern about the
continuing problems of Iran and Iraq, and the increasing signs of
trouble on the North African littoral.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>There remained many unresolved and difficult areas for potential
disputes. One of these, as in other parts of the world, revolves
around water. Itamar Ya'ar has written a perceptive analysis in Water
Disputes as Factors in Middle East Conflicts. He identifies and
quantifies the nature of the difficulties, which will become worse as
populations increase. He makes a strong case for co-operation between
states, and offers practical solutions. He concludes by observing
that despite all the investment in technology, including that for
weapons, water exploitation techniques have changed little in the
last 4000 years.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>Asia Prospects</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In looking further East, the Indian subcontinent was an area of
considerable interest. Internal and external disputes continued to
give cause for concern, and water disputes in this region were also
an issue. The future impact of Japan on the international scene was
examined. Expert opinions were divided over both its long term
economic prospects and its ability to become a more active player on
the international stage. There was however little doubt that the
countries of the ASEAN region in general were set to continue their
strong economic growth patterns for some time to come. Their success
was also reflected in a new debate over the comparative merits of the
Western liberal democratic model compared with these more centralised
- yet free market - government systems.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Korea continued to be an area of concern. North Korea has been
working hard to gain weapons of mass destruction, and 1994 saw a
period of seriously increased tension,before diplomacy was
successful. In the longer term the division of the peninsular both
geographically and economically seemed certain to give rise to new
tensions.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Inevitably, uppermost in our consideration of Asia was the
question of China. The extraordinary rate of economic growth, the
size of the population and the different nature of its communist
government, all made it the key determinant of the future of the
region. Zahid Anis, in his Progressive China: a historical
perspective and a likely future , has extrapolated historical trends
to analyse China's economic and strategic potential. He</P>

<P>predicts a continuing high rate of growth, leading to China a one
of the world's largest economies by 2010. He does not see the
emergence of a more democratic form of government until economic
prosperity can be more widespread. Nevertheless, he believes that
China can be an agent for stability and needs therefore to be kept in
the fold.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>Africa and South America</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Space in the Seaford House Papers prevents our publishing some of
the papers which looked at other regions. Sub-Saharan Africa was an
area of particular interest during 1994. At times it appeared that
the four horsemen of the apocalypse had decided to set up home there.
The Western response was primarily in the form of humanitarian
operations. The world was focused on Rwanda, but Angola continued to
generate refugee problems as well. At the same time, in the South
there were new portents, which could point the way to a more
optimistic future. The elections in South Africa and Mozambique were
triumphs for multiparty democracy. The transition in South Africa
started much better than most had dared to hope. Developments in
South America also provided useful examples of positive developments
in international relations. Some of the Course examined the factors
which have led to the move away from military dictatorships and to
the regaining of control of the economies.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>Other Topics</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Not all the research papers completed by the 1994 Course were
centred on International Relations topics. The last two in this
collection are included as an illustration of the breadth of topics
examined during the year. The need for probity in public life was a
recurring theme of the year. Paul Acres, in his Politics and Ethics
in Leadership - Machiavelli Revisited examines the tension between
politics and ethics today in the light of Machiavelli's writings. He
finds that The Prince still has much to offer to the modern leader.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The concluding paper is piece of historical research from primary
sources into a fascinating study of Command in war. Ady Wray has made
a comparative study into the circumstances which led to the dismissal
of General Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien in 1915, and that of Lord
Downing's removal from Fighter Command after the Battle of Britain.
It is possible that if they had both paid attention to the writings
of Machiavelli, they might have lasted longer.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>The Importance of RCDS</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>These six papers give a flavour of the range of the topics covered
by the 1994 RCDS Course. They are of course entirely the personal
views of members, and do not reflect the official thinking of their
governments. It was a year with contradictory portents for the
future. The unconstrained optimism following the fall of the Berlin
Wall had long since evaporated. Black scenarios were all too easy to
paint. Yet, the peaceful transition to a multi-racial democracy in
South Africa, the peace process in the Middle East and the ceasefire
in Northern Ireland all gave alternative optimistic possibilities for
the future. One indicator of the will for nations to cooperate and
work to better future was in the composition of the Royal College of
Defence Studies Course itself. Every region was represented, and the
senior policy-makers of 34 nations were able to consider in depth
each others' problems and aspirations. Potential difficulties ahead
will make the contribution that such a course can make to promoting
world stability even more important than in the past.</P>
