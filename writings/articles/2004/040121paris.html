			<p><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">We have discussed the history of the Entente Cordiale this morning; and the original Entente of 1904 echoes perhaps faintly the issues of today. Certainly co-operation between France and Britain in the field of security remains a central priority for tackling the new uncertainties in the world. I shall outline what I believe these world challenges are, why our two countries have a unique contribution  to make, and most importantly how I believe we should take forward this joint venture to make the world a better place.</font></p>
			<h3><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">The World Challenges</font></h3>
			<p><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">First then what are these world challenges that we face? There is a fair degree of agreement on the most important ones in the wider sense of global security. Whether we look to the United Nations, Europe&#146;s recent agreement on its security concerns in the Solana paper of last year, or the US National security strategy of September 2002, or NATO&#146;s thinking at the Prague summit of December 2002, we find common themes in each. Despite the tremendous successes of recent years in moving towards more democratic states, there remain parts of the world where either government is not functioning, or where totalitarian regimes still hold sway. At the same time, there is the growing threat from those who owe no allegiance to any state, but operate outside the rule of law, and can use terror as their weapon. <br>
					<br>
					We face problems of international crime; of corruption which undermines democracy; of poverty in much of the world; of declining natural resources be it fish, oil or water; of environmental damage of which global warming is the most acute; of population growths in poorly governed regions; and of disease returning and spreading through global travel. <br>
					<br>
					Some of these factors make conflict more likely, and all of them need concerted action by the global community. The European Union is well suited to taking on these tasks, although it could be still better. However, the EU remains less effective when trying to meet the challenges at the hard end of security. These challenges come from undemocratic states developing powerful new weapons, with which they hope to deter intervention by the international community. They also come from extremists who combine a willingness to die for their cause, with a wish to maximise the terror and destruction on their enemies. And, they come from the strife within weak countries, which can lead to mass refugees, who look for help from the rich nations of the world.  </font></p>
			<h3><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">The changing world</font></h3>
			<p><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">The 1990s were a key decade in the emergence of a new international security structure. The end of the Cold War, the reunification of Germany, the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union, and the accession of former Warsaw Pact members  into NATO, followed by the enlargement of the EU have completely transformed Europe's security. <br>
					<br>
					It might have been assumed that the disappearance of a real and urgent military threat from the Soviet Union would have decreased the military activity of western nations. Yet North American and European armed forces have been engaged in more real military operations in this decade than they were in the four decades of the Cold War. <br>
					<br>
					The Gulf War of 1991 seemed to set the new agenda for the international community. The effects of the break-up of the Former Republic of Yugoslavia have given us a series of challenges, - Bosnia, Kosovo, Macedonia - and the stabilisation process is not yet finished. East Timor, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, Bunia in the Congo have been a new adventures in humanitarian interventions.<br>
					<br>
					Less positive has been the emergence of India and Pakistan as nuclear powers. The development of North Korea in the nuclear weapons field, and its continuing hair trigger relationship with South Korea remains a danger. Taiwan remains a potential flashpoint. Perhaps most significant has been our inability to bring about a stable Palestinian state living in harmony with Israel. <br>
					<br>
					Many had hoped that the new millennium would bring a much greater emphasis on human and individual rights by the major democratic powers. But the attacks on the Washington and New York on 11 September 2001 have changed the direction of our approach to security once more. <br>
					<br>
					In any examination of world challenges, the attitude of the United States is always the key factor. We in Europe worry if America appears to be going isolationist, and we worry if it seems, as is currently the case, to be  moving to being too unilateralist and interventionist. America's position is even more important when we talk about how France and Britain can together meet world challenges. Our different approaches to &quot;living with the giant&quot; can cause great difficulties. <br>
					<br>
					Now is not the time to explain how our very different relationships with the US have developed, but I think we must recognise the implications as we seek common approaches to new threats. Since 9/11 we have seen the switch from universal support for operations against al-Qaeda in Afghanistan to international disarray over intervention in Iraq.<br>
					<br>
					 It was to me a particular sadness that the run-up to the Iraq operation last March was the cause of such fierce rhetoric between the UK and France. The effects are likely to have put back the development of our ability to act together in our common security interests by a considerable amount. This negative effect has perhaps been reinforced by the inability to agree on the EU Constitution at the Inter Governmental Conference at the end of last year.</font></p>
			<h3><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">The Special Contribution</font></h3>
			<p><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">Why does it matter that France and the UK are not co-operating much more closely on security? It matters at so many levels. We are the two European permanent members of the Security Council, the two nuclear powers, the two European nations which field, and can deploy over distances, modern professional armed forces, and perhaps most importantly the two nations that feel a responsibility for promoting wider international order. <br>
					<br>
					Our leaders have recognised this in recent years. The historic Franco-British summit at St Malo in 1998 ended decades of UK obstruction over European defence co-operation. From that meeting stemmed a series of developments which gave a real impetus to the development of European capabilities to underpin the development of Common Foreign and Security Policy. <br>
					<br>
					The Helsinki Summit of 1999 provided real goals for deployable military capability: an EU force of up to 60,000, which could be deployed within two months, and sustained for a year to meet crisis management and humanitarian type tasks. Both France and the UK have been restructuring their military forces so that they can undertake these new tasks, and needed to be in the lead together to encourage the rest of Europe. <br>
					<br>
					Since St Malo, there have been ups and downs. I much regret that in 1999, the opportunity was missed to bring France back into the fold as a fully participating member of the integrated military structure of NATO. Many of the specious arguments about European defence undermining NATO could have been more easily laid to rest. But perhaps more importantly, NATO would have been stronger and Europe would be a more equal partner with the US. I think that there are also particular problems for both our nations in pushing forward sensible European defence capabilities as hard as we might.</font></p>
			<h3><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">Where are we today?</font></h3>
			<p><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">Let me take stock of where we are today. EU nations have agreed that they need to meet the challenges of proliferation, international terrorism and failing states. We have agreed that we need to improve some of our key military enabling capabilities so that we can deploy armed force to prevent war, or if necessary defend ourselves. We agreed these things in NATO summits in Washington and Prague as well as in EU Helsinki headline goals. And yet progress has not been encouraging.<br>
					<br>
					 France and Britain have increased their spending on defence just recently, but they are the exceptions. Nor have they used that extra money to promote these much needed European capabilities. Indeed the paradox is that despite the importance that we each attach to defence matters, neither of us is prepared to benefit from integrating our security more deeply. NATO has one example of a military enabling capability which is affordable because most of its members share the cost: that is the NATO Airborne Early Warning and Control aircraft &#150; AWACs. Both France and the UK operate their own systems separately, at greater cost. </font></p>
			<h3><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">Sovereignty &amp; Security</font></h3>
			<p><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">This common perception of the importance of sovereignty in security seems to me to be at the heart of many of our difficulties at working together, leading Europe, in meeting the global challenges. There is no doubt that we face, and this particularly the case in the UK, great difficulties in convincing our electorates that sharing sovereignty in defence and foreign policy is a good thing. <br>
					<br>
					Let me briefly explain why I believe it is becoming essential. The reasons are economic, political and miltary effectiveness. <br>
					<br>
					First, let me make the economic argument for rationalization of defence capabilities at the European level. The costs of any armed forces divide broadly into three parts: people, equipment and running costs. The costs of people in a professional military rise in line with commercial companies wages &#150; faster than general inflation. The costs of military equipment rise at an even higher rate because of the small numbers involved, the high technological risk, and inefficiencies of the market.  The only element of a defence budget which matches normal inflation is that of infrastructure running costs (provided we don&#146;t fight too many wars). Thus unless defence spending rises faster than inflation, any long term programme becomes unsustainable. <br>
					<br>
					In Britain we have a great fanfare of trumpets about every three or four years and announce a new approach to defence, which at the same time covers reductions in ships, tanks, aircraft and people. We are in just such a situation currently. Of course we rationalize as much as we can internally to limit the damage to our forces. Again both France and the UK have done more of such rationalization than many others in Europe, and so our ability to make further moves in this direction are much more limited than say Germany. Rationalisation at the European level would offer one way out of this economic bind.<br>
					<br>
					Next let me look at the political importance of working more closely together in defence. We share a belief in the international system, and do not think it either fair or sensible to leave the solution to the world&#146;s problems to one nation, even one as benign and rich as the United States. The US makes no secret of the driving rationale for its foreign policy: it is US national interests. These may sometimes be the same as Europe&#146;s or France&#146;s or the UK&#146;s &#150; but they may not, as we often see in trade negotiations. In Europe, we may agree with the US about the nature of the threats, but we have different views on how to deal with those threats. Sometimes a short term response can make you feel good, but merely make the long term problem worse. I would argue that this may be the case with Iraq, only time will tell. <br>
					<br>
					If we wish to be able to share our security approaches with the US to come to best approaches, we need to operate with them as serious players. The UK tries to do this by public support and private debate &#150; not very successfully in recent times I would argue. France takes a different approach, and I would argue is equally unsuccessful. Together, and within the context of the EU, we would operate as a much more powerful grouping, provided that we had also provided ourselves with the necessary military capabilities to follow through. So there is a political need for much closer work in this field.<br>
					<br>
					My third rationale is that of effectiveness. We are throwing money away on our armed forces as they are currently structured. The &euro;150 bn that the EU members spend on defence is a little under half the US spending. It buys a tiny fraction of US military capabilities. Why? Because it is split between 15 armies, 14 airforces, 13 navies, all with headquarters, logistic organizations, training structures. The waste is beyond comprehension. Some governments may realize that more spending means more waste rather than more capability, and this is another element of the overall decline. <br>
					<br>
					Of course a fully integrated European defence capability is many decades away &#150; if it ever comes to pass. But that doesn&#146;t mean that there is nothing that can be done. We need to make moves now &#150; and France and the UK need to be in the lead.</font></p>
			<h3><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">The Way Ahead</font></h3>
			<p><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">We need to examine where we could together provide military capability on a shared basis which would provide more bang for the euro. There would of course be national benefits in lower costs, but if they are to benefit Europe&#146;s wider security needs, the savings must be used to procure the missing capabilities. This can only happen if the EU moves forward with some form of defence budget. All EU members must choose whether to contribute to their common agreed needs either with capabilities or with cash. <br>
					<br>
					Military power is not the only requirement to meet the new global challenges &#150; but it is the area in which Europe is failing. A newspaper headline last year declared that the Entente Cordiale had died aged 99. My message is that never was the Entente as necessary as it is today. France and the UK together can give a sense of vision to Europe in the security field, and in doing so make the world a better and safer place.<br>
