			<h3>Guns for hire</h3>

			<p>In the same week that the Ministry of Defence asked the nation for its views on foreign policy, the FCO has published a discussion paper on outsourcing military activities to private companies. It is not just the British armed forces that are stretched too thinly across the globe, but most other nations having been reducing their militaries since the end of the Cold War. This makes it difficult to do much for governments that feel insecure, multi-national companies that feel unprotected abroad and for  extended United Nations peacekeeping duties. A gap in the market has given rise to Private Military Companies (PMCs). Providing armed forces for profit has a rather chequered history, and the reputation of mercenaries has deteriorated over the years. Yet as the FCO points out, we are already outsourcing many of our traditional military activities to commercial companies, and the divide between combat and non-combat is often fairly blurred. The paper is designed to solicit comment about possible policy options.<br>
				<br>
				There is a real difficulty in defining the activity. While the freelance soldiers of the Congo tainted the reputation of mercenaries, the Gurkhas, the French Foreign Legion and the Vatican Swiss Guard could be caught by too wide a drawing of the category. A protocol to the Geneva Convention has tried to list all the criteria that have to be met to be classed as a mercenary. But when motivation is one of the criteria, it is generally regarded as an unenforceable rule. The difficulties that the United States  is having over the status of foreigners captured in Afghanistan and held in Guantanamo shows how complex this can be. Defence companies often provide direct training, logistic and technical expertise to their overseas customers. Does this make their staff into mercenaries?<br>
				<br>
				The companies who are set up as PMCs offer a wide range of services. It may be advice to governments, training of indigenous forces, logistic support to overseas military forces, demining operations, security of commercial installations, fishery protection, counter-piracy or provision of observers. Some companies specialise in guarding and security, and prefer to call themselves Private Security Companies (PSC). There are over 100 PSCs operating in Africa. Whether PMC or PSC,  they all sell military expertise  for use in other countries. Unconstrained, this could have significant impact on UK foreign and security policy. The main suppliers of such expertise are the USA, South Africa, Israel and the UK, but an expansion in the activity is forecast. In some cases  a PMC can be used an extension of government policy. It was widely believed that the role of an American company MPRI in the Balkans was to provide assistance to Croat and Bosnian forces in the Balkans, at a time when US forces were not to be involved. Similarly the use of para-military security guards for protection of UK oil companies can be seen as protecting supplies and helping the economy, where it would not be feasible to use soldiers. <br>
				<br>
				Yet things can go badly wrong. Working in weak states, PMCs may be propping up an unpopular faction. If it is a UK company, then many will assume that the UK supports the faction which has purchased the services of the company. If fighting breaks out, British residents may be at greater risk. British forces may need to come to the rescue in a conflict which they would not otherwise have been involved in. There is also the question of whether the PMC may have a vested interest in prolonging insecurity and conflict in order to keep the income stream flowing.<br>
				<br>
				Despite the possible drawbacks, it seems likely that the use of outsourced military power will continue to grow. The United Nations has a particular problem in putting together competent forces to prevent or resolve conflict. It may be that it will see advantages in calling upon trained forces available at short notice to carry out some of its military tasks, and perhaps at lower cost than convention armed forces. The FCO Green Paper makes the case for formal regulation of PMCs, while pointing out the difficulties. Underlying the discussion is the assumption that this may be a new industry in which the UK can excel. The USA operates a licensing system for its PMCs, and they appear to have flourished under a supportive government policy. It will be interesting to see if the view in the UK and the rest of the EU is as positive. The Green Paper dips a toe in the water. It offers a range of regulatory options between a total ban and just a voluntary code. <br>
				<br>
				There are many concerns about accountability of freelance armies which may make it difficult to enact legislation. Licensing UK companies to use lethal force in support of other governments is a significant step. But given the extent to which we now outsource our own military power, perhaps the time for winding up the standing army approaches. Will future British Governments put their wars out to competitive tender?<br>
