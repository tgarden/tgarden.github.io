<p class=Body style='mso-outline-level:1'><span lang=EN-US>The Kosovo campaign
of 1999 demonstrated<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>unambiguously
the weakness of European military forces. Recognition of the consequences of
this lack of capability<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>has put new
vigour into the EU defence debate. Yet decline in military capability is
systemic in every European country. The Helsinki goals will do nothing to
address this decline. National defence budgets over the past 15 years have been
decreasing in real terms. Even if current aspirations to hold military spending
level were to be achieved, the decline in capabilities would continue. Military
equipment and personnel costs rise faster than domestic inflation, and
therefore fewer people and weapon systems can be afforded each year. There is
no prospect of significant uplifts in defence budgets in Europe, despite the
acknowledged need for a range of expensive enabling capabilities for post Cold
War operations. Palliative measures now on trial are unlikely to have a major impact.
The only option for European nations is a progressive integration of their
forces to realise the economies of scale that would allow effectiveness to be
maintained. There are opportunities for initiatives that would produce short
term pay-offs. Despite the severe political difficulties of a long term plan
for integration, the alternative is worse. Trying to maintain sovereignty in
defence provision will mean that the nations of Europe will eventually be
unable either to meet the requirements of even their most modest security needs
or to exercise any influence over US defence and security policies.</span></p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
provision and maintenance of appropriate and adequate national armed forces is
an increasing challenge for the rich nations of the world. The move away from
conscripts and reserves, expected and expecting to defend national territory,
towards highly trained professional militaries, ready for anything, continues
everywhere.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Yet manning and
equipping these multipurpose forces is proving ever more difficult. In the
United States, there are calls for an extra $50 bn per year to rectify
widespread and important deficiencies<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1'
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[1]<![endif]></span></span></a>,
while the perceived need to meet new threats makes yet more demands on funds.
In Australia, the government has announced a large year on year uplift in
defence spending. In Europe, the transition from the standing armies of the
Cold War to more reactive and deployable forces is far from complete despite 10
years of reshaping. In the UK, that decade has seen three major defence
reviews. But a sustainable balance between commitments, the capabilities needed
to meet those commitments and the resources provided to pay for the
capabilities seems as far as ever from being achieved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Body><span style='font-family:Times;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Body><span style='font-family:Times;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
is increasingly apparent that, looking ahead over the next two decades,
traditional national approaches to defence problems are not going to provide
adequately for Europeís defence and wider security needs. Collective security
through NATO provided an affordable answer to defence needs during the Cold
War. In the 21st Century, the capabilities required are more complex and
difficult to define. At the same time, the lack of an obvious direct threat has
led to severe reductions in the funds made available to the military.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Much has been achieved in the
attempt to shift armed forces from their Cold War posture towards new, more
practical structures. The work on the European Security and Defence Initiative
within NATO and the developments in the EU flowing from the Franco-British
accord at St Malo in December 1998 have both demonstrated that Europe wishes in
future to be a serious provider of international security for itself and for
others. However even these very limited moves have generated arguments over
NATO/EU duplication in planning and capabilities; about the &quot;right of
first refusal&quot;; about arrangements for the non-EU European members of
NATO; about French deviousness, German fecklessness and US unilateralism; about
the differing demands of Article 5 and the Petersberg tasks. These matters are
important and central to the success of the next several ministerial meetings
in NATO and the EU.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mishandled or
ignored, they lead rapidly to headlines and embarrassment; but increasingly
they are not the main issue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Body><span style='font-family:Times;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Body style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span style='font-family:Times;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>The central issue of affordability is neither new nor
unfamiliar to defence administrators. But a point is being reached where it can
no longer be disguised or circumvented. For decades the annual cost of a given
unit of defence capability in most European countries has been growing
considerably faster than the year on year inflation figure. A policy of level
spending in real terms, which is the most the UK or other European governments
have aspired to for the past 15 years, has therefore meant a constant decline
in military capability. Many unsuccessful efforts have been made in the past to
defeat defence inflation. In the UK we now await the results of Smart
Acquisition, Smart Research and, internationally, of the Framework Agreement.
Such initiatives can help, but temporarily and at the margin. If precedent is
any guide, they will ultimately not make a significant difference. And unless
European governments can find a way to get a significantly better return for
each unit of defence expenditure, starting relatively soon, their ability,
separately or collectively, to take substantive military action in defence of
their interests is going to evaporate. Even before the reality of military
ineffectiveness becomes established, the perception of it will mean European
governments losing whatever influence they have over US defence and security
policy as well as the support of their electorates for whatever levels of
defence expenditure then obtain. The only escape from this dilemma is for
European governments to begin to integrate a financially significant percentage
of the effort they devote to defence. The political difficulties will be very
great. But so will be the consequences of a failure to grapple with the issue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the Cold War period any assessment of force requirements began with a threat
analysis. Today such assessments are more about risks and needs. European
governments plan on the reasonable assumption that there is little or no risk
of external, land based aggression against Europe in the next 20 or so years<a

camp (which would imply a failure of European policy on a scale so massive as
to invalidate most other forecasts) it will not in this timescale be able to
launch a ground attack of any size or plausibility.<span style="mso-spacerun:

credible will be asymmetric or will involve long range missiles using perhaps
weapons of mass destruction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To
deal with these narrow, if serious, threats, assuming the will to do so exists,
will require a specific but limited set of deterrent, defensive and retaliatory
capabilities on the military side. (Although the distinction may become harder
to draw, many aspects of defence against, and response to, terrorism will of
course be non-military.) As far as missile defences for Europe are concerned,
these will, in future, have to be procured and used on an international basis
or not at all. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

aside nuclear issues and missile defence, whatever conventional military
capability Europe has is likely to be used either in dealing with internecine
conflict inside Europe, certainly possible but perhaps decreasingly likely
beyond the Balkans, or in peace-making and peacekeeping outside Europe. <a

US will increasingly (and in a post Cold War era understandably) want to leave
conflict inside Europe to the Europeans. They will certainly look to Europe for
support if they become militarily engaged outside the Americas. As for the
Europeans, operations they might expect to have to mount will include
humanitarian relief, promoting the rule of law, and rescue of EU civilians.
Any<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>threat to European
interests sufficiently grave to warrant the despatch of an expeditionary force
for possible warfighting will attract the interest of the US; and that US
interest, once engaged, will tend to favour operations at the high intensity
end of the spectrum using the most modern weapon systems.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

artificial ñ whether one is thinking in terms of political decision-making or
military feasibility. European nations are only going to have single sets of
conventional military capabilities and they are not going to be infinitely
flexible. Both kinds of operation are bound to involve casualties (the Kosovo

establishment to pursue a policy different, in greater or less degree, from

the UK, are not going to be able to meet this criterion for much longer.<span

persuading the US to take the views of its European allies into account seems
bound to increase. Domestic political considerations, including demographic and
cultural change, and evolving perceptions of the countryís national interest
and of the kind of sacrifice that might be made in its pursuit, are all
pointing in the same direction. Unwelcome though some of them may be, there is
nothing inherently reprehensible or censurable about these developments. They
reflect the overwhelmingly positive fact that the US is a huge and vigorous
democracy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Europeís governments will have to determine the military capabilities and force
structures that they require and that they think they can sustain. There are
internal and external security needs. At the high intensity end of the
spectrum, European forces will need to provide added value to US capabilities,
if they are to be credible as partners. (What has been called Gross Role
Specialisation, where the US provides the hi-tech capability and the Europeans
the foot soldiers i.e. the body bag candidates, is never going to be
politically saleable. Events may take us in that direction but it is not a
defensible policy option for European governments and would not be a
sustainable posture for them vis a vis the US or each other.) European nations
will also have to be prepared to field effective military capability in a range
of more local, yet demanding, circumstances. The trend of the last ten years in
European military provision indicates that it will be impossible to meet these
challenges without a radically new approach. It also suggests that we need to
start now to think in practical terms whether such an approach is possible. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

nations review their armed forces and produce new structures. Each national
review of defence policy produces a force structure tailored to the expected
commitments and available funds. Within a very short time, the funding proves
to be inadequate and a new review is initiated. Almost invariably this results
in a further reduction in force capability rather than in an uplift in funds.
Public memories are short, and each defence review is presented as a long-term
solution. There has been an understandable desire to gloss over inconvenient
considerations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But in truth, and
despite temporary upsurges in defence funding such as that in the early
eighties, the inability to sustain a balance between resources and commitments
has been evident since the end of World War 2. Fudges in the past were possible
for some countries able to use the reduction of post colonial commitments to
balance the equation. The end of the Cold War gave a rationale for another
reduction in capabilities to balance the budgets of all NATO nations. The net
result has been a sustained decline in military capability over many years. It
may well be that this has reflected a correct estimation of electoratesí
priorities for their nations. But little or no effort, over the years, has gone
into the attempt to develop an informed consensus on the subject. At some point
in the next several years the UK, as well as Europe as a whole, risks passing a
critical point beyond which the maintenance of a military capability for
anything other than the most local defence requirements will become impossible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

years ago Britain could mount a rescue operation for the Falkland Islands at a
distance of 8000 miles, and was able to initiate and start deploying an
appropriate task force in a single weekend. During the Nineties, culminating in
1999, Kosovo, a small if militarily inhospitable province, was abused by its
better armed but in international terms not much more impressive metropolitan
neighbour, Serbia. The former Republic of Yugoslavia has been a focus of
conflict since the end of the Cold War. The possible need for action in
relation to Kosovo had been apparent for years. The distances from Western
European countries were so short that Italy was able to act as the aircraft
carrier for the operation. And yet, when it came to the military operation,
virtually all of it had to be conducted by, and, for some of the more potent

in real terms over the past 25 years shows four distinct phases. In the mid
1970ís defence spending was fairly steady around £25.5 bn a year at current
prices. It then climbed for the first half of the 1980ís, reflecting a
particularly chilly phase in the Cold War and a consequent NATO wide commitment
to growth. It reached a plateau of some £33.5bn (in year 2000 values) before
going into a decade of decline from 1986 to level out at the current base of
around £23.5 bn a year. Over the past quarter of a century, real annual
spending has declined by just 8%, and for much of the intervening time was up
to 30% higher than the 1975 level. Yet a comparison of any of the indicators of
military capability shows a marked drop in available capacity. Between 1975 and
2000, manpower has declined from 346,000 to 212,450<span style="mso-spacerun:

Nor is it easy to argue that the smaller numbers of men and combat units have
been compensated for by technological improvements. Despite the vast
expenditure of the 80ís, the UK could only provide some 4% of the overall air
effort for the Kosovo campaign<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn9' href="#_ftn9"

of the UK budget, closely follow civilian wage costs. In time of full
employment they may need to run ahead of their civilian comparators given the
many disadvantages of service life. Even in time of unemployment, there is
little evidence that the services can underpay and retain their people.
Increasingly the type of manpower that is needed within the services is
becoming more technically able, and thus even more expensive. Wage costs
usually rise at or above inflation.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn11'

of UK defence spending is related to equipment. Price changes of defence equipment
are more complicated to analyse than the rise in manpower costs. The life
expectancy of a particular item is often a matter of choice, and may be
determined by budgetary pressures. Some equipments may cost very much more than
their predecessors, but fewer of them may be required to do the task. For
example<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn13' href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span

each Lancaster bomber in 1945 cost some £45,000 per copy or just under £1
million at todayís prices. The Tornado bomber is its lineal successor, carrying
a similar bomb load over similar distances. When the Tornado came into service
in 1980, it cost the same as 20 Lancasters in real terms. The Tornado is
currently undergoing a midlife update, which will cost another £10m per
aircraft.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Each generation of

programmers have had to balance their budgets by reducing the fleet size with
each new generation of equipment. This causes an uncomfortable rise in the
relative support costs of fleets as smaller frontlines still require the full
range of maintenance, logistic and training infrastructure to sustain
them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Planners use a similar
technique for weapon stockpiles. Weapon costs show a high cost rise with each
new generation. There is a temptation to keep the old stock and bring in the
new weapon more slowly. In the case of both weapons and platforms, the reducing
numbers of units procured further forces the unit price higher still as
research and development costs have to be recovered over smaller buys. In the
1950s, the UK could contemplate procuring four different aircraft designs just

There were many different fighter and conventional bomber aircraft types. By
the turn of the century, all the air defence and offensive combat tasks were

military computer and other high technology equipment have not experienced the
falls in price and increases in capability that have been seen in the
commercial computer industry and in consumer appliances. There are three
reasons for this. The production runs are very short, and often spread over a
long time. The technologies needed are often very specific to military usage,
and have limited application beyond. The period of time from conception to
deployment is typically 10 to 20 years and it is difficult to take advantage of
technical innovation, which is at a much faster rate. Most equipment costs rise
at more than 5% above inflation and in certain areas may be much higher than
this. Attempts are made to offset this problem by increasingly looking to buy
off the shelf solutions. Such an approach does help, but for many military
needs there is no ready solution on the commercial shelf. There is no doubt
that pressures will remain to exploit cheaper civilian products. Computing and
communications would appear to be a particularly good area for such an
approach. Yet the demands of military ruggedness and security, coupled with a
need to interoperate with allies seems to have prevented much progress so far.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

remaining 18.3% of defence expenditure includes the costs of maintaining the
support for the armed forces. Most running costs will be fairly closely aligned
to normal inflation in the economy. Fuel, accommodation, food, transport,
maintenance and logistics support activities have no reason to be out of line
with inflationary pressures more generally. Indeed there are often
opportunities to undertake some of these activities in ways that take them out
of some of the extra costs incurred by military operations. Contractorised,
civilianised and out-sourced support should be sustainable with level funding
in real terms. In a time of declining forces, it is possible to realise some of
the value of the defence estate by selling off land. Short term spending
regulation is also possible by reducing the activity levels of forces, and this
has historically often been used to compensate for rising costs elsewhere in
the defence programme. If used too extensively such measures affect both combat
capability and personnel retention. These lead to steeply rising costs in later
years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

have therefore in the UK defence programme an inflationary problem. Personnel
costs rise at a rate slightly above inflation; equipment costs rise much faster
than retail price inflation; and running costs rise in line with inflation. The
combined effect is that level defence spending in real terms inevitably leads
to decreases in force levels year on year. In fact, level funding in real terms
has been the exception since 1985, and the resultant decrease in force levels
has been even more severe. The Defence Review in 1991 under Tom King <a

the combat front line by around 30% with only limited reduction in defence
spending. This reflected how badly overheated the programme was at the time. In
1995, Malcolm Rifkind <a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn16' href="#_ftn16"

and aircraft to keep the capability for rapid deployment. In each case, the
Defence Secretary argued that there were good strategic reasons for the review.

British political party is advocating doing more to defence spending than, in
effect, keeping it level in real terms. However persuasive the case made in
Whitehall by, and on behalf of, the Armed Forces this situation is not in
present circumstances going to change for the better. There are too many
competing and more immediately compelling claims on the national budget. It
follows that there will continue to be a decline in capability. Some attempt
was made from 1987 to square this circle by imposing year on year
&quot;efficiency savings&quot; of up to 3% on the armed forces to compensate
for this pervasive defence inflationary effect. What passing improvements were
made have long since been absorbed, and it was never going to provide a
long-term solution. The proportion of GDP devoted to defence in the UK has
declined from 5.3% in 1986 to 2.4% in 2000. The British Government announced as
part of the public spending review in 2000 that it intended to reverse the
decline in defence spending. The amounts concerned equate to 0.3 % growth<a

difficult it is to see such projects through successfully. Moreover, the
defence industries are reluctant to be integrated by European fiat. They look
to partnerships, which improve their shareholder value. They rightly want to
keep open the option of transatlantic link ups. This is more likely to improve

a start on the elimination of expensive duplication. Today this approach is
allowing greater military capability to be deployed. While the Dutch and the

eases the problem of mounting international combined air operations. Most
importantly, given the high unit cost of air force platforms, it is not
surprising that many nations operate common equipment. This also eases the
problems of rationalisation. Finally, the high costs of infrastructure to

useless if one or more nations declined to take part in a particular operation
for national reasons. However, for significantly lower costs to be achieved the
force would have to be organised on a basis very different from current on-call
multinational arrangements. It would operate from a single main base located
centrally in Europe, but would have dispersed flights to service national
needs. There would be a single headquarters, manned by personnel from the
contributing EU nations. Aircrew would be multinational and not tied to the
airframes provided by their nations. There would be a single planning,
servicing and logistics organisation to support the force. Most importantly,

yards to meet common criteria. Likewise the supply support of navies, through
the RFA and its equivalents, would lend itself to pooling. The great majority

would free up funds to start providing some key new force elements.
Reconnaissance and Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) are two roles, which are
expensive in equipment and training, but which could offer opportunities for
building up EU capabilities to operate with the US forces available to NATO.
There will be considerable development in the use of UAVs for the tactical reconnaissance
role, and there is a need for a European satellite-based strategic
reconnaissance capability. Both of these capabilities will be expensive, but
will be essential if Europe is serious in its intention to provide real
military capability. The information exploitation organisation will again be
much more cost-effective if operated at the supranational level. This
capability needs to be considered in the context of an EU intelligence
capability, which, given the political, military and financial complexities, is
dealt with below as part of medium term integration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of the air transport, air tanker, naval auxiliary, land support, reconnaissance

smaller nations it would both increase available capability and reduce costs.
It is thus possible to see opportunities for enhancing the support element of
military power in Europe in a relatively short timescale through aggressive
rationalisation of forces in being, and exploiting the moves towards
public-private partnerships. Significant defence funds would be released
provided that nations took the consequent manpower and infrastructure savings

insist on retaining the ability to operate their forces nationally. The effect
of this approach was seen in the divergence of the national Tornado

down in 1999 because the aircraft it operated were no longer representative of

Portugal operate 424 F16s between them. Despite the divergence in Tornado IDS
updates, Germany, Italy and the UK could look at how pooled arrangements might
allow them to make a relatively early contribution of some of their 570

pooling of assets. Sharing training, engineering, logistic, and operational
planning facilities would throw up significant operating cost savings. These
would be greatly increased if the number of bases required could be reduced as
a result. Most importantly common fleet management would play a vital role in
retaining system configuration control so that all Eurofighters remain fully
interoperable. If Europe moved towards the American large airbase concept, we
might perhaps imagine an operationally ready force of some 400 Eurofighters
made up of 20 multinational squadrons distributed over as few as five airbases
(one for each operating country).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In addition, an operational training base on a sixth airfield would be
required.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The training base could

would allow nations to contribute in other ways than just aircraft and aircrew.
Starting the process early would allow a common view to emerge about the
platform/weapons combination that should be developed. Leaving France, Germany,
Italy and the UK to develop their own future offensive capability will
inevitably result in a sub-optimal solution, with some relying on US solutions
and other on national upgrades. A united EU view on both the importance and the
nature of the next generation offensive air power requirement would be a very
powerful driver towards procuring an effective capability. There is time for
this process to begin, provided that nations start to operate in this role
together. Under the current arrangements, Europe is likely to perpetuate the

of the more expensive power projection capabilities is provided by the aircraft
carrier. Few European nations can afford to field such a force; for those that
stay in the role, the opportunity costs are very high. The UK currently plans
to provide two carriers, in 2012 and 2015<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn29'

but for the reasons argued earlier seems unlikely to be able to afford such a
capability when the time comes. France, Spain and Italy will probably wish to
retain elements of the carrier role as well. Operated on a national level, one
or two aircraft carriers do not constitute a viable and reliable force, and the
opportunity costs are severe for other defence capabilities. The timescale is
sufficiently long for interested EU nations to look at how they might jointly
contribute to a force of 4 or 5 aircraft carriers with their supporting ships
and aircraft. The obstacles are great and the precedents less than encouraging.
(Franceís Charles de Gaulle will, for instance, carry a conventional carrier
aircraft, the Rafale, while the UK carriers seem likely to be equipped with an
American system, the STOVL JSF. Given their use of the Harrier in the present
generation, it would make evident sense for Italy and Spain also to go down the
JSF route.) But if the European region is to retain a capability in this sector
ñ and the expeditionary concept makes much more sense with one than without one

in one variant or another.<b><o:p></o:p></b></span></p>

requirements permeate every aspect of military operations, and an independent

truly autonomously. Pooling of current intelligence related capabilities will
be difficult for a number of reasons. The equipment used by nations is diverse,
and much of it outdated; the national exploitation is jealously guarded; and
there are bilateral difficulties, particularly for the UK, with wider
information sharing. For these reasons, it would probably be more effective to
build up a new EU intelligence capability from scratch. This would be
expensive, but would allow a fully integrated modern system to be established
relatively quickly. The political complications are self-evident but if the EU
wanted to focus on one area for priority action, then Intelligence could provide
it. The platforms, communication, fusion, exploitation and dissemination
systems could be built up to be fully interoperable with NATO, but also
independently usable. Kosovo showed that the inability to share digital
intelligence data was a problem throughout the operation. <b><o:p></o:p></b></span></p>
