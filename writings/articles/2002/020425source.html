			<h3>Israel-Palestine: What Now?</h3>

			<p>The months go by and the security situation in Israel and the Occupied Territories becomes worse by the day. The Source has reported the ups and downs of the search for peace over the past 3 years, but at no time have the prospects looked as bad as they are now. There is no lack of peace plans. From Oslo to Abdullah, there have been rational schemes which could improve Israeli security, and give the Palestinians a viable state. The shape of the ultimate settlement, if it is ever achievable, is obvious to most outside observers. The Palestinians will have to accept compensation in exchange for the right of return of refugees to their old homes in Israel. There is no peaceful arrangement in view, which might allow Palestinians to flood back from around the world to outnumber the Israelis. They have a case for their claims, and they need to be properly compensated. This is a difficult issue, and Arafat or his successor will have to work hard to sell it. In a mirror image of this significant concession, the Israelis will have to remove all their settlements in the Occupied Territories, and the inhabitants will have to be compensated. There is no possibility of a viable Palestinian state if the settlements and their access roads remain. Most of them have been located with the intention of dividing the territory, and controlling the water resources. It will be hard for any Israeli leader to sell this idea. Indeed it is possible that Rabin was assassinated in 1995 because he was accepting the necessity for removing the settlements. But there is a symmetry in the concessions that both sides will have to make.<br>
				<br>
				As for Jerusalem, the simple solution would be to make it an international city, which neither side could claim as its own. Objecting to such a concept is likely to be the only area of agreement for both Israel and Palestine. Certainly, neither should be allowed to declare Jerusalem as their capital, and some system for running the city jointly must emerge. If  the design of the major points of an agreement are clear, and would include Abdullah&#146;s offer for pan-Arab recognition of the right of Israel to exist, there are other issues on the relationship between the two states that would be necessary. The land area is so small, and they are so closely entwined economically, that it would be essential that there was a co-operative security arrangement between the two states. This sounds very difficult in the current climate of mistrust. Yet Israel has managed to achieve just such a relationship with Jordan. That must be the model for any future Israel-Palestine agreement. <br>
				<br>
				The question now is how it is possible to get from the current situation to this rational arrangement for the two peoples. The military operations in the West Bank and Gaza by the Israeli Defence Forces have made the prospects of a long term settlement much lower. The added sense of humiliation and anger among Palestinians (and beyond to their Arab neighbours) is one factor. But perhaps even more important has been the destruction of the Palestinian Authority infrastructure. It seems clear that part of Israel&#146;s strategic plan has been to destroy the sinews of a functioning Palestinian state. Even if peace broke out tomorrow, and the Palestinian Authority were invited to take over control of government in its areas of interest, it could no longer carry out the task. The successive years of investment in governance, largely funded by the EU, has been destroyed in a matter of weeks. This a real problem. But it is not one that is unfamiliar to the international community. In Mozambique, Kosovo, Sierra Leone, East Timor and now Afghanistan, the rebuilding of nations from chaos has been undertaken. Palestine will need a similar approach. <br>
				<br>
				How will such a peace arise? There is no possibility of Arafat and Sharon suddenly deciding that they have had enough and agreeing to change their current nihilistic approaches. This means that a settlement will have to be imposed from outside. Since neither Israel nor the Palestinians can do much without outside financial support, money must be the first area in which to exert pressure. Ideally the USA should use its large financial and military equipment clout to force Israel to the negotiating table. The EU is in a similar position with the Palestinians. If the US is unable or unwilling to undertake this, then the EU, with the help perhaps of the UN, will need to take on the whole problem. Israel needs its trade with the EU, and the special arrangements that it has for that trade. It is unlikely that the US would be prepared to bankroll any Israeli deficit stemming from an EU trade embargo. At the same time the UN needs to push aggressively to investigate every potential war crime caused by either side. The world must bring these two peoples to a stable arrangement, even if they appear to be set on self destruction. The alternative is a regional war which will affect the well being of all nations for a very long time. <br>
