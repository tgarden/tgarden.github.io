<H3>Alliances &amp; The Management of Conflict in the 21st Century
</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>We have been given a fairly comfortable picture of a world where
the Pax Americana will look after us all, particularly as insurance
against the potential big security problems.  It is fortunate that
this all powerful  state is reasonably friendly and awesomely
democratic. It may of course be that this will be a relatively short
period of comparative calm before other powers contest this singular
role borne by the United States of America. Our title for this
discussion encompasses a very sizeable chunk of the future, but I
doubt that we are really thinking much beyond the first decade of the
next century. A hundred years' on is beyond our ability to hazard
sensible guesses. Unless there has been a worldwide Malthusian
disaster, the globe will be many times more populous, its finite
resources will be greatly depleted, India will have surpassed China
as the world's most populated country, the technology will be more
different than the changes from hot-air balloons to supersonic
aircraft. But even if we set our  predictive sights a little more
near term,  the question which I think I need to pose  is : What does
it mean for  the rest of us? </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The world that we have discusses is one where we accept a
dependency culture on the United States for conflict prevention and
for righting International wrongs. No doubt  when the US perceives a
problem as affecting its national interests, however broadly defined,
it will use its economic, diplomatic and if necessary, military power
to solve that problem. It may be that it will find it more
comfortable to be leading an alliance,  which shows that other
nations agree with its interpretation of international law, human
rights or democratic government. We shall therefore continue to see
ad hoc coalitions of the willing, under NATO or other frameworks,
when two or three are gathered together with the US leading the way
to freedom. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The question is what are the rest of the nations going to do when
the US is not interested - or perhaps even more seriously - when the
US is antipathetic? Or perhaps, most likely of all, the US is not
interested early enough to help with conflict prevention. We have had
some experience of these difficulties with the handling of the
breakup of the FRY. In addressing our  topic of Alliances &amp; the
management of conflict in the 21st Century, we have plenty of advice
on  how to handle future problems in an alliance context, when they
are problems in which the US wishes to be involved.  I think we need
to consider if we can get the rest of the nations to do more, both in
their own interests and in that of international conflict prevention.
This is not just a question of a future European Security Identity, 
the problems that I am outlining have parallels in the Far East, in
Southern Africa, in Central Africa and in North Africa, in the Indian
subcontinent, in the Middle East and elsewhere.  Each of these
regions has legitimate regional security interests which could be
assisted by appropriate use of alliances, but each has problems in
forming such alliances with the necessary common purpose and with
providing the resources to give them teeth. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Taking Europe as an example: the initial post Cold-War debates
over whither NATO, and the machinations of the WEU seeking a greater
role, have subsided in the aftermath of a successful alliance
operation in the Gulf, and an easier NATO/WEU relationship. All the
words now are positive about the way Nato's assets are at the
disposal when necessary of the WEU. I think many would feel that the
rhetoric is perhaps rather stronger than the experience on the
ground. But nevertheless, progress is being made. At the same time,
the future of European Defence is an issue, and the WEU is unlikely
to be the answer to that.  What sort of security concerns will be
exclusively internally European? There are plenty that one can
predict: economic migration, international crime, minority human
rights, environmental pollution and terrorism. Any direct external
military threats to European states will be issues for NATO, and
expansion of membership will be an important factor, and for the
foreseeable future and as Bob said will inevitably involve the US.
That does not mean that we can assume the continued good health of
NATO, but it does mean that we should work at it. The internal
security issues that I listed are all ones that are within the
capability of the European Union to manage. It will need to ensure
that it uses the carrot of membership as a way of ensuring that its
neighbours continue their difficult paths to free democratic market
economies. All that is possible, and if anything most of the internal
security concerns are ones that require police rather than military
alliances. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The question then is what external potential conflicts would
Europe wish to manage, not with a US lead, and having established
that there might be such a need, how would Europe manage such
intervention, and what would it use? Individual, and even in concert,
 European states have in recent times acted independently externally,
but always in a legacy of Empire context. Europe as a whole has no
empire in that sense. It has trading interests worldwide, but it is
difficult to conceive of it being prepared to operate in a military
interventionist sense to promote its trading rights. Suez belongs to
a past age. Economic regions may become more confrontational, but it
is economic power rather than military power which is likely to be
the chosen weapon of confrontation. European external intervention is
therefore most likely to focus on circumstances where electorates
take the view that "something must be done". This bottom up driven
security policy has an inverse square - or perhaps cube - law. The
concern of the electorate for a given situation varies as the inverse
of the square of the distance of the occurrence from its home town.
Thus a murder in the next town is of far greater immediacy than a
massacre in Central  Africa. This analysis gives little hope to those
who expect the European states to get their act together to provide
an alternative world policeman to the United States. The likelihood
is that European actions will be small scale and relatively
short-range.  Bosnia gives an excellent example of the limitations of
what is possible. The UK contribution is a significant burden to the
British Army - yet it is equivalent to only about one brigade.
Despite spending around 2.3% of their GNP on defence, European states
have neither the forces, nor the necessary equipment, for large scale
faraway prolonged independent action. And as such operations become
less possible, the capability will be reduced yet further, and we
have a downward spiral of capability and will for such operations. 
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>My shorthand analysis underlines the view that the US is a
necessary partner in the management of conflict  on a worldwide
basis. Our aims should be to keep the US engaged, and here, we should
explore future greater engagement of the United Nations. The tension
between the US and the UN which erupts from time to time is
profoundly damaging to the interests of international security. The
UN has many weaknesses, but it is the best we have as an effective
agent for the promotion of international law and human rights. In
seeking to examine the role of alliances in international security,
we should focus on developing the one body which has the potential to
provide a rational tasking for whatever alliances, formal, ad-hoc,
temporary, what have you are formed. If we have a task for the 21st
Century, it is not to turn the UN into a world government, but to
give it the capability to task conflict prevention and promote
international security through coalitions of the willing. I would add
as a footnote to this, that my own perception is that the provision
of international police forces is as likely to be the future need
than high intensity conflict military forces. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Regions will have to become better at managing their local
problems. While the military power of the US may deter the massive
calamities, it is unlikely to provide sensitivity to problems early
enough to prevent more local conflicts from arising. The local
regional alliances are more aware of troubles which are likely to
give rise to conflict, and they have the intelligence which is so
important. Here the current formal organisations could have an
increasing international role to play in conflict prevention at one
remove. We have seen how the Partnership for Peace programme has
allowed NATO to develop relationships with a wide number of states.
Exchange of ideas on the training of military forces as agents of
conflict prevention , the promotion of democratic values  and crisis
management operations has been a key element of PfP. The most
practical way in which standing Alliances will be able to contribute
to conflict prevention in the future will be to extend this
co-operative role to more distant regions when invited to do so. And
the indications are that the invitations are there. Military training
teams have operated, by and large on the old colonial link basis,
from single nations. NATO, the WEU, the OSCE, the EU, the UN might
well look increasingly to sponsor new security relationships.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>So in summary, I agree that the United States is the key to
conflict prevention in the near to mid future, and that Alliances
have a two-way  role in this: involving the US; and legitimising the
US involvement. Nevertheless, this is not enough, nor is the US
likley to relish the role for the indefinite future. We need
therefore to be inching towards new, less formal perhaps, groupings
which can link together in practical ways  to enhance conflict
prevention. The UN must not be abandoned. Regional groupings will
need to take an interest in the security of their region, and the
formal international alliances can help the regional groupings with
advice, training and expertise. Alliances can have an increasing role
in the management of conflict in the 21st Century.</P>
