<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Flying a Tornado just above the tree tops at
500 mph is the most exhilarating experience that life has to offer.
Playing a three-dimensional game of chess in the sky, where the loser
will be on the sharp end of a missile, keeps the fighter pilot's
heart pounding. Edging down into a small clearing to drop off special
forces  in a Chinook makes the difference between a successful
hostage rescue and a major disaster. Aircrew in the Royal Air Force
today meet daily challenges, whether in training or on operations,
which are beyond the imagination of most. The National Audit Office
reported earlier this year  that the training of a single pilot costs
nearly &#163;6 million pounds over the 6 years that it takes. This
must be the most expensive professional education in the world.

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Such an elite force should have no
difficulty in filling its cockpits. Yet never were The Few so few.
Sixty years ago, 71 fighter squadrons fought in the Battle of
Britain: today there are just 5 air defence squadrons in total. Today
the RAF aims to have a total of just 540 pilots to cover all of its
combat roles. Even with such a small requirement, it is short of
nearly 100 fast jet pilots, and the situation is set to get worse.
The Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Peter Squire, has
gone on the record over the last week to explain some of the
difficulties that the RAF faces from underfunding and equipment
problems. There is talk of the introduction of large cash bonuses to
retain the expensive trained manpower that is draining away to the
commercial airlines. Is the RAF in crisis?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">While the excitement of military flying
remains as great it was in the past, the expectations of young people
are very different. The nomad lifestyle of the armed forces and
paring away of  support over the years has taken its toll. Wives (and
most pilots are still men) expect to have a career of their own. They
expect to be able to move up the property ladder like everyone else,
and not be treated as tenants without rights in married quarters. The
new tasks of the last decade in the Gulf, Bosnia, Kosovo, Sierra
Leone, Mozambique and East Timor  bring repeated periods of
separation, which are made worse by  manpower shortages. The
administrative bureaucracy increases as commanding officers become
budget managers in the more cost conscious armed forces. New
equipment is delayed for budgetary or technical reasons.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The internet has given aircrew a very public
forum to discuss their worries and irritations. In the past this
would have happened in the Mess on a Friday night; but now they are
more likely to be flying another mission over Northern Iraq. Life is
difficult, and it is not helpful to point out times in the past when
it was much worse.Nor is it the fault of this Government. The
problems, like the demise of military medical services, stem from
successive cutbacks in funding over many years. Holding defence
spending level now will not be enough to solve the problems across
all three services. The RAF of 52,000 people  is small, but should be
sufficient  for the tasks that we ask of it. The joy of flying is as
great as ever, but the attractions of civilian lifestyle alternatives
grow ever greater. The political and military leadership of today
have real problems. Commitments are rising, costs are rising, and
expectations are rising. Promises of new equipment  sometime in the
future are not enough. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">For anyone who has a passion for flying, the
RAF remains the best career possible. But the signs are that the
number of empty cockpits will continue to increase. The Chief of the
Air Staff is right to alert a wider public to his problems, but in
the end it will need an electorate willing to pay more for
Defence.</FONT></P>
