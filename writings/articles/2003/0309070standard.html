			<p><font size="-2" color="#0b0b0b">As more British troops set off to Iraq, the emergency services spent Sunday rehearsing for a major terrorist attack on Central London. The peace dividend at the end of the Cold War is a distant memory, and threats at home and abroad seem ever more pressing. Does the sight of  fire and ambulance services in full protective suits mean that Londoners are now at greater risk of an al Qaeda atrocity using weapons of mass destruction?<br>
					<br>
					The terrible events of 9/11 showed what fanatical terrorists can do to modern society. Cities like New York and London concentrate large numbers of workers into magnificent but vulnerable buildings.  Our dependence on technology makes disruption of the economy much easier for an attacker. Terrible as previous Irish terrorist campaigns were, each outrage was usually preceded by some form of warning and the devastation was relatively contained.  Bin Laden terrorism seeks maximum casualties and direct damage to Western economic strength. For this reason the emergency services have to think the unthinkable.<br>
					<br>
					Intelligence, police work, airport security and border surveillance are key to preventing terror attacks in the UK. We have the advantages of island borders which are easier to control. We have the experience of many years of counter-terrorism work. And after the destruction of the World Trade Center, international intelligence co-operation is much closer. Yet we also have the vulnerabilities  of an open society which depends on international trade. The City is a focus for the wealth generation of the world. Westminster is a universally recognised symbol. London is a magnet for travellers from all over the globe. The infrastructure is already heavily loaded and perhaps more fragile than we realise. The power failures last month showed what chaos a minor glitch in the National Grid can cause to the capital. Computers trip off line this weekend and British Airways is grounded.<br>
					<br>
					The series of al-Qaeda related outrages since 2001 have used explosives to kill. Why then do we see rescuers at Bank station prepared for a nuclear, biological or chemical attack? Their suits will allow them to work safely in an area contaminated by chemicals, or keep them free from infection, or protect them from nuclear radiation. The worry is that a terror organisation that feels no constraints may try to increase the devastation they cause by using unconventional means. Another fanatic cult, Aum Shinrikyo, released Sarin nerve agent in Japan on two occasions in the mid 1990s. Documentary evidence from the al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan has shown that, among the thousands of recruits, some were trained in the production and delivery of radio-active, biological and chemical agents. <br>
					<br>
					Public fear of unconventional weapons is great. Poison gas, germs and radiation are all unseen enemies. Indeed, it can take some time to even realise that an attack has taken place. Nevertheless, they give problems for the attacker as well. They are difficult to acquire and many can be intercepted  by high technology detectors at ports and airfields. Nor do such terrorist weapons necessarily pose as great a danger to life as old fashioned explosives. The second Aum cult attack  killed only 12 people although it was a chemical weapon release in the confines of the Tokyo underground. Nuclear weapons for terrorists would not be a repeat of Hiroshima, but more likely the dispersal of medical research isotopes by ordinary explosive. <br>
					<br>
					The emergency services will have to cope with whatever international terrorism throws at us. Despite the best efforts of our counter-terrorism agencies, it is more than likely that one day al Qaeda will get through somewhere in the UK, and perhaps in London. The police, the fire service and health workers will have to cope. Yesterday's exercise is an important part of their preparation. No exercise can replicate the real thing; but it can make sure that our emergency services have tried out the procedures and equipment that they might need. Government will have to be prepared to put the cash in quickly to fix the list of problems that such exercises always expose. We are two years on from 9/11; we may have been fortunate to have so much time to prepare. The government legislation to get Local Authorities committed to preparing for such possible attacks has yet to be completed. <br>
					<br>
					What can the ordinary Londoner do? Enjoy life in the world's greatest city as usual. The capital has lived through wars and terror before, and the statistical chance of being a victim of al-Qaeda remains tiny. The prudent might want to make sure that their employers have a sensible approach to security, and a well practiced building evacuation system. Politicians at local as well as national level need to be reminded that security of their electorate is the first priority, and that this means money as well as fine words.</font></p>
