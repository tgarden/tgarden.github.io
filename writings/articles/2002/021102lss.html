		<h3><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">International Security: Duties Beyond Borders</font></h3>
		<font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Recent thinking about international  security seems to have narrowed down to little more than three issues. The sudden rise of Iraq as the target for early US military action  caught Europe on the hop. The sporadic worldwide terrorist incidents have revived  fears of another 9/11 style outrage nearer home. The   cycle of violence between Israelis and the Palestinians leaves the world in despair, and few suggestions for resolution. </font>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Important as these issues are, the longer term global problems have not gone away. Global warming is a real security problem. Rising sea levels, famine and disease will all contribute to make conflict more likely. Population and poverty pressures will generate more emigration to richer areas and deplete resources further. The traffic in people will increase the profits from international crime. Corruption of officials will undermine democracies.  Conflicts will rise from these pressures. They may be terrorist in style, or even more traditional  wars between states.Long term global  problems can only be tackled at the global level. </font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">One nation, even one as powerful as the USA, cannot keep the lid on this boiling pot of problems. Yet left as the only power with global reach, like any nation state, it will take those measures that seem to be in the best short term interests of its own  citizens. The EU meanwhile, in its slightly incoherent way, seems more ready to attack the underlying causes of insecurity. On environment, it pushes for the Kyoto treaty. It spends far more on overseas aid than does the US. It tries to engage with failing states, and use diplomacy and international law to bolster them. To counter terrorism, the EU co-ordinates justice and home affairs to good effect.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">But if Europe is to be taken seriously by the USA, it will have to do something about its parlous military dimension. There is no lack of military tasks in the field of conflict prevention. EU members states will have to bite the bullet of military integration soon, or they will have no means to act either in partnership with the US, or in their own regional interests.  Increased defence budgets would help, but the real  answer is more effective spending through pooling individual capabilities. Only then can we talk across the Atlantic as equals about how to make world a more peaceful place. Once that happens, the United Nations can be developed to work more effectively.</font></p>
