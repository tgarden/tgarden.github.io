			<h4>Three Years On</h4>

			<p>Each September, the world now remembers the unprecedented outrage of the destruction of the World Trade Center in New York. Americans were, and still are, astonished that they were so vulnerable and so hated in some parts of the world. The <i>War on Terror </i>which President Bush initiated has been running for three years, and it is time to assess its effects. How has the threat from fanatical extremists been reduced? How has international peace and security been improved? How has&nbsp; world opinion of the USA improved? How has the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction been reversed? How have defences in the West been reinforced?&nbsp;</p>
			<p>There has been no lack of action. Attacking Afghanistan was an appropriate response to the devastation of 9/11. The al-Qaeda training camps should have been closed down years before. The consequent fall of the Taleban regime was an opportunity to bring that war ravaged country back into the international community. Yet promises of financial and security help have been illusory. The political process was soundly based on UN proposals, but the warlords have been allowed a free hand. The international community has provided little in the way of security for Afghan citizens outside of Kabul. The opium harvest is the only source of economic development. With NGOs reluctant to risk their people, we are failing to deliver on our promises. Al-Qaeda sympathisers can still find safe havens.</p>
			<p>Neither has the intervention in Iraq&nbsp; made the world a safer place. The arguments before the invasion split old allies. The post-war strategic incompetence of the occupation authorities has&nbsp; generated new threats. Neither weapons of mass destruction nor al-Qaeda links were in Iraq before the war. Now, Iran presses on with uranium enrichment perhaps believing that it may as well take its opportunity. North Korea seems also to have decided that the disarray in the international community post-Iraq is its chance to become a nuclear power. Long term control of Pakistan nuclear weapons remains a concern.</p>
			<p>Iraq has become yet more violent. The&nbsp; deaths of Iraqi civilians number well over 10,000 and are largely unrecorded or investigated. The USA has lost over 1000 of its forces, and has been unable to enter Fallujah since April. Peace in Najaf was achieved by the good offices of Ayatolla al-Sistani rather than the Iraqi interim government, and the militia forces of al-Sadr remain ready to cause trouble again. Just as in Afghanistan, Islamic extremists find fertile recruiting ground and no lack of weapons and training opportunities.</p>
			<p>The other engine for Islamic anger is the situation in Israel and the Occupied Territories. Few still believe that the Road Map to a two state solution is now possible. President Bush, speaking with Tony Blair at his side, has accepted the Sharon approach of the security wall and continued settlement building. The prospect of a viable Palestine state has receded into the distant future.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Russia has justified its repressive brutality in Chechnya using the language of the war on terror, and is now reaping the whirlwind. In Sudan and elsewhere in Africa, injustice and repression is the order of the day. From Indonesia to Spain, the fruits of Islamic extremism are deaths of&nbsp; ordinary people. International approaches to these many problems seem stalled. Yet, the unilateral retribution on innocent people for the outrages of extremists does no more than recruit more to the terrorist banner. It is time for Europe to co-operate to show that there are alternatives to the might is right philosophy. If we do not, then a US pre-emptive strike against Iran may signal the next turn of the screw in this desperate spiral of violence.</p>
