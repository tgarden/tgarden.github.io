<P> In the last decade we have become used to a wide variety of ways
to put together military forces for operations beyond the NATO area
for operations in support of the requirements of the  international
community. It may be that Kosovo will prove to be a unique occasion -
or at most once per 50 years - in which the formal NATO mechanisms,
with the whole of the Alliance, and its partners, engaged. The
circumstances were special - there was a direct effect on many of the
Euopean NATO nations - and the experience is one that may make it
less likely that we shall adopt such an approach to international
problems repeated further afield than the Balkans.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>None of this means that NATO lacks relevance. Indeed the spirit of
NATO will be there in most operations outside of Europe. The sub
questions that we are addressing are about the mechanisms for
European engagement with the US beyond Europe. We have plenty of
precedent in this decade to see the kinds of operation that we are
talking about. The Gulf War of  91 and the various Iraq related
operations that continued since are examples of some of Europe
engaged with the US in operations beyond Europe. The mix of nations
involved has been different at different times. One vast ad hoc
coalition in 1991 decreasing to the UK and US in 1998 for Desert Fox
and the subsequent operations that have been going on all this year. 
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>We could run through all the other humanitarian operations that
have had some European involvement, the latest of which is East
Timor. In this, 3 European nations are taking part and the US is
there in support. The lead nation, Australia, is neither NATO nor
European, but is using NATO procedures and doctrine. In each case the
common factor is the requirement for military forces from more than
one nation being able to operate sensibly together. Currently we have
only one organisation that can provide the necessary training,
doctrine and standards to put together efficiently multinational
forces at short notice. Even when operations are not NATO sponsored,
it is NATO standardisation and NATO experience which makes it easy
for them to operate. In East Timor, systems for agreeing rules of
engagement are just as important as in Kosovo. So we need NATO, with
the added value of the partnership arrangements, for putting together
forces for a much wider range of  contingencies.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>For the particular case of Europeans, which I will define as
members of the EU, there is little early prospect of operations under
an EU banner until there has been much greater development in the
field of common foreign and security policy.. While NATO provides the
framework for Europeans to undertake a range of operations, we still
continue to provide that capability and political will on an
individual nation basis. In both cases this makes for inefficiencies.
The idea of a second ARRC, equipped by the Europeans is a good one,
although  it opens up a new set of questions about achieving
mechanisms within the EU to make rapid consensus achievable for
deployment. Certainly Europe could be achieving much greater
capability for its defence expenditure, if the nations were prepared
to pool resources and eliminate duplication of  HQ, logistic support
and training. Strategic air lift is an easy example for early making
of a real European increase in capability. On a parallel model to
NATO AWACS, the EU could put together a strategic air lift capability
which could work either with the US in a formal NATO operation, or by
itself in other UN sponsored operations, and would be able to operate
even if not all contributing nations wished to be involved. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>NATO has an essential role in setting standards so that coalition
military operations can work. It also has an important role in
encouraging European nations to make better provision for military
operations. The Defence Capabilities Initiative is important in this
respect, but it is not the first such initiative in NATO's history.
Some European nations are going to want to be involved in operations
outside Europe. For the more challenging scenarios, they are likely,
but not necessarily, going to be operating with the United States.
Whether they are or not, they will need to field forces with modern
capabilities. So NATO's desire to keep its European members up to the
mark, is important whether or not we see NATO as some sort of world
policeman. The EU in GDP terms is as rich as the US, it certainly has
worldwide economic interests. It needs to work harder at shouldering
its international security responsibilities. Such a move would not
undermine NATO: it would provide NATO with more effective capability
when it needed it, and Europe with more options when NATO was not the
appropriate agent for action.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P> Mr Solana, as he takes up his new role, might  like to look at
how the EU can be moved towards rectifying the key European
shortfalls that he identified in his last post. in NATO. While
defence outputs are the key, it would be a start if EU nations agreed
not to cut their defence budgets in real terms for the next 3 years.
The time could be used to develop a number of important capabilities
for use in Europe or beyond, within NATO or without, and in alliance
with the US or with others.</P>
