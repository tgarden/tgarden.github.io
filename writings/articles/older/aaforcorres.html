<H3><CENTER>The Issues for 1997</CENTER></H3>

<ADDRESS><CENTER>Remarks to London Correspondents 19 December 1996
</CENTER></ADDRESS>

<P>It struck me as I started thinking about today's remit, that
seemed to have spent a remarkable amount of time this year travelling
to conferences, seminars and workshops which had been called to worry
about the future of European security. And after a year of such
debate, I find it difficult to get too worried. Margot has asked us
each to forecast the key defence issues for 1997, and it could be fun
to speculate about all the terrifying things that just might happen.
I am not going to do that because it seems to me that we are getting 
better at managing emerging crises, and from a European perspective,
we have never been safer. That is not to say that there are not some
difficult security issues which will need sorting out fairly soon. I
shall leave the post IFOR arrangements to others, but in any event I
do not see Bosnia as a major problem in 97 - perhaps the following
year. I worry some about the possibilities of conflict in and around
Israel, but there is still room for good sense to prevail. Cyprus is
not without danger, but should be manageable. Nor will I use the
wider definition of security, for the 10 minutes that I have. There
are certainly more dangers from criminality, corruption and
environmental problems than from classic military threats. For the
UK, and some other parts of Europe, terrorism will remain uppermost
as a security concern. We can if you wish pick any of these up in the
discussion. </P>

<P>I shall concentrate on where NATO is going and how it can manage
the difficulties of the coming year.  I think NATO has three
challenges - Enlargement, restructuring and resources - and they are
all to a degree interlinked.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I think you can argue that the Bosnia problem has kept NATO
members interested and engaged. As the involvement declines, there
will be a return to a number of key issues which are coming to a
head. At the front of these is the question of enlargement, I see
this morning's post brought another seminar on the subject. 
Although, the security and foreign policy specialists are all only
too aware of this looming problem, there is little public debate or
interest at present. The common wisdom is that 3 or 4 states will be
invited to become full members in a first tranche. They are likely to
be Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and perhaps Slovenia. That
would leave relationships with 3 rather different categories of
European states to be addressed. There are those who do not meet the
membership guidelines yet for various economic and political reasons
such as Bulgaria and Romania and Slovakia; there are those that could
probably meet the guidelines in the near term but would cause
particular tensions - and here I think of the Baltic States, and then
there is Russia, Belo-Russia and the Ukraine. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The impetus, from the United States, to get on with early
enlargement is probably unstoppable. The difficulties in the process
will come from the attitude Russia takes, the requirement for extra
resources and the need for national approval. At a NATO seminar last
week, a Russian parliamentarian suggested that NATO should offer
membership on equal terms to Russia as it started enlargement. He
claimed that it would be a long time before Russia qualified, and it
might not even want to join, but it should be accorded the special
status that it deserved. I was in the Ukraine 3 weeks ago, and there
the signals were much more confused, The debate was over whether
Ukraine should be looking East or West or ploughing an independent
security role. There was some feeling that they should be recognised
for having given up their nuclear capability. The suggestion raised
there was for a central European NFZ, and it seemed to have some
attractions. The NATO speakers showed little sign of flexibility.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>So the key debate, will be on how to manage enlargement, what to
do with the PFP states that are left out in the first tranche, and
how to manage relationships with Russia. In the background the IGC of
the EU  will be continuing to look for progress towards a european
foreign and security policy, and the means for carrying out. I do not
expect that this will bring exciting developments in the next 12
months, and I shall not therefore discuss it further.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>At the same time that NATO is looking at enlargement, it also
needs to get on with restructuring. All agree that it needs to be
more streamlined and make savings in its overheads. Yet the most
likely outcome will be the elimination of the recently created HQ
AFNORWEST in favour of AFCENT and AFSOUTH, thus rewarding the least
efficient at the expense of the most. Accession of new members, and
the return of France, will also increase pressures for representation
at every level, and cause more growth of HQ.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>And that brings me to my third security issue for 1997, the
question of resources. Nations, having taken significant force cuts
at the end of the Cold War, appear to be continuing to redefine 
their defence needs downwards. If I take the UK case, which I know
best, we saw cuts of around 30% in combat capability in the early
90s. We then had another exercise to cut support costs by using
private companies to do support tasks which further reduced the
numbers of people in the armed forces. If the election is won by the
Labour Party, they have promised a full scale review of Defence
within 6 months of taking office. Small wonder that retention of
trained manpower is proving difficult. Similar stories across the
NATO membership, and France is an interesting example, suggest that
NATO when it enlarges will take on a greater security obligation at
the same time as its members are reducing the resources they are
prepared to devote to defence.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>As a final security issue for 1997, perhaps I can add that much
depends on the role that the United States wishes to play. The
preservation of NATO is important for European security because it
provides the linkage with the US as well as providing a real military
capability. I have no reason to suppose that next year will be any
different from this, but I suppose conflict in Israel could strain
the US/European relationship more than usual.</P>
