			<h3>Unseasonable Army Leaking</h3>
			<p>By Sir Timothy Garden</p>
		</div>
		<p>The leaks about prospective cuts in the army usually come thick and fast in the first couple of months of the year. As the MOD races to meet the financial year deadline for balancing the budget, painful savings measures are proposed to make the necessary headroom for cost growth in priority programmes, and for new unbudgeted requirements. By May all this has normally been sorted out, and there is little point in crying wolf until the next year's round of possible cuts.<br>
			<br>
			However we seem to be suffering a flurry of news stories about how the army is to be ravaged in order to pay for the Royal Navy's shiny new aircraft carriers. This is coupled in some quarters by a note that the new Chief of Defence Staff is an admiral for the first time since the end of the Cold War. What is going on?<br>
			<br>
			First there is the story that it is proposed to cut the army by 10 regiments. In fact the army is already short of enough manpower to make up 10 regiments. Not only is it suffering from acute undermanning, there seems little hope that it will be able to increase its strength in the foreseeable future. As each unit runs light, operational gaps have to be filled from other units, who as a result run even lighter. It is  the personnel department's equivalent of the engineering practice of &quot;robbing&quot;. It is equally inefficient and damages unit cohesion and morale. It also puts a great burden on individual soldiers. This combines to affect retention adversely, and the manpower shortages get worse. Even if recruiting improves, the incoming new recruits are much less effective than the experienced ones who are leaving. Logically, there would be much to be said for recognising the problem and reducing the army regiments to match the sustainable manpower. It would mean that some readjustment in commitments would be necessary. Whatever the logic, the politics of scrapping regiments will ensure that nothing changes in the immediate future. The government has said that it will keep to the frontline that it established during the Strategic Defence Review  of 1998, and it is not about to allow the Opposition to huff and puff over the disappearance of famous regiments.<br>
			<br>
			Another leaked document is said to be arguing for cuts of  &pound;1.2 billion from the army budget to offset cost growth in the aircraft carrier programme. The report seems to be very specific, and Ministers have not denied the accuracy of it.  While the figures sound dramatic the required saving is spread over the next four years. These are figures which are not unusual in cost growth of major programmes which are still at an early stage. Defence planners have to look across a range of options for places to find off-setting savings. It may be that if the army is unable to fully man itself in this timescale, there will be economies that can be taken in a number of khaki areas.<br>
			<br>
			Yet another leaked document suggests that cutting two tank battalions may be needed and that this would equate to a quarter of the current  UK tank force. Again this is a logical area to look at. With the introduction of Apache attack helicopters, the role of tanks is much diminished. They are also difficult to transport to the areas where the army now finds itself operating. Indeed the long term plans for the future army sees no role for the classic main battle tank.<br>
			<br>
			While this inter-Service bickering remains amusing to watch, there is a serious issue which will soon have to be addressed. The cost of military forces increases each year far faster than normal domestic inflation. Yet  the MOD feels it is doing well when it manages to argue for level funding in real terms for the next year or two. The net result is progressive and inevitable cuts. It seems very  unlikely that the two aircraft carriers will be affordable in ten to fifteen years time when they are due for delivery. If they are given total priority,  the army and the air force will be half their current size by 2020. <br>
			<br>
			Australia has recognised this defence inflation problem and has just announced that it will raise defence expenditure in real terms every year for the next ten years. It seems unlikely that Gordon Brown will be prepared to be as generous. Expect continuing leaks, increased outflow from the Services and a declining military capability. Perhaps co-operation with EU partners in defence is a good idea after all. <br>
