<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Looking at the programme for the next two days, we have the
promise of an extraordinary conference with the key issues of Asian
security being addressed by speakers of great expertise. Philip gave
me a completely free hand in terms of what I should focus on this
pre-conference session. There is of course a temptation to try to
cover everything in just 30 minutes. We meet at a time when three of
the regular Asian security issues, which bubble up from time to time,
seem set to reach the boil together. Taiwan, North Korea and Kashmir
are all in the news with sporadic, but perhaps increasing,
confrontation between their main players. Each of the potential
conflicts have a nuclear dimension which makes for added concern..
However, we shall undoubtedly discuss those in detail over the next
couple of days. It seemed to me that rather than trespass on the
grounds of our expert speakers, I might try to set the global
security context as I see it for the coming years. We are able to
dimly see a new pattern of international affairs emerging, which may
in the end prove to be a footnote in history, or, as I shall argue, a
watershed. This will have a profound effect on the importance of
Asian affairs to the peace and security of the rest of the World.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Looking to the future is always a somewhat hazardous affair. We
extrapolate from recent experience into the unknown, often coming to
quite incorrect conclusions. So perhaps what I am going to say should
be seen as merely one possible future, and like all security
specialists, there may be a touch of worst case analysis, so that we
can prepare and prevent it coming to pass. Through recent years, we
have seen many predictions of the rise of Asia as an economic power,
coupled with a possible decline in Europe and North America. Before
that, through much of the Cold War, we at times seem to think that
Communism was unstoppable except by military means. That developing
countries would fall like dominoes if not afforded the protection of
the West. Sometimes, we see similar views being expressed with Islam
replacing communism as the unstoppable ideology. Yet the experience
of the almost simultaneous widespread death of ideological communism
at the end of the 80s, coupled with the fall of Asian markets in the
90s have together given rise to an equally dangerous presumption.
There is currently a complacency in some parts of America and Europe
that liberal democracies and market forces are the unstoppable models
which will spread peace, harmony and wealth throughout the globe. We
may all hope that this will be the case, but it is not yet proven.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	The 90s have been an interesting decade. The end of the Cold
War, the reunification of Germany, the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact
and the Soviet Union, and the accession this year of Poland, Czech
Republic and Hungary into NATO have completely transformed Europe's
security. It might have been assumed that the disappearance of a real
and urgent military threat from the Soviet Union would have decreased
the military activity of western European nations. Yet European armed
forces have been engaged in more real military operations in this
decade than they were in the four decades of the Cold War. It is as
though the Cold War gave western democracies an excuse for inaction.
The Gulf War of 1991 set the new agenda for the international
community. That it was possible to assemble so many participating
nations into the ad hoc coalition was of course made easier by the
obvious breach in international law of the invasion of Kuwait. The
success of the Gulf War boosted the confidence of the international
community, that it could right international wrongs. The break-up of
the Former Republic of Yugoslavia has not yet finished. Nevertheless
Bosnia and Kosovo have further reinforced a US/European view of how
instability can be contained. The threat and, if necessary, use of
force is now less constrained if the aims of the operation are judged
by the major western powers to be the promoting of justice for
individuals. The previous embargo on intervention in the internal
affairs of states has been lifted. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	In the UK, our newly elected government in 1997 astonished many
by announcing that foreign policy would have an ethical dimension.
Britain had always been seen as essentially a pragmatic operator on
the international scene. Foreign policy was the promotion of national
interest by diplomatic effort with few absolutes.  As with many of
its policies New Labour was in tune with the times. Kosovo was a
humanitarian intervention. A number of speakers for the far Left and
the far Right have pointed out, there was no direct national interest
in the internal arrangements of Kosovo. Such voices were in the
minority. Humanitarian action has been cited in the past as a
justification for military action, but usually in retrospect or in
concert with more traditional justifications of vital interests.
Kosovo was different. With a pretty arguable UN authority, NATO
nations undertook an air campaign with a stated humanitarian aim.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	There are other straws in the wind. The establishment of the
International Criminal Court is one. The indictment of General
Pinochet is another. The steady arrest of people for war crimes in
Bosnia is a third. I may seem to be drifting from the subject of our
conference. What have these events to do with Asian security? I would
argue that this is the start of a new dimension to international
relations which will have implications for global security. It is of
course possible to argue that none of this is new. Indeed the
protection of human rights is fundamental to the United Nations. That
may be true in treaty language, but the reality has been far short of
it over the years.  The first change for the new millennium may then
be a much greater emphasis on human and individual rights by the
major democratic powers. If this is so, then there are some fairly
major implications for how we deal with a number of places in Asia -
not least China, but I shall return to this in a moment.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Economic</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	The next big question which affects security is the economic
one. We seem for the moment to have survived the Asian markets crisis
with confidence on the mend. Yet economic issues shape our security
thinking. The moves we are making in Europe towards an integrated
economic structure are inevitably leading to debate on the next stage
of foreign policy and security integration. Our economic competition
with the US, and of course the Asian competition with the US, will
have implications for the military support that we can both (Europe
and Asia) expect in the future from America. The economy of Russia is
a security issue for us in Europe as it is for Asia. Most of all the
economic success of the US is a key to the sort of world we can
expect. There is no reason to assume that the US has managed to break
out of the cycles of growth and depression, however much the
investment analysts might want to believe it. The internet stocks of
today are the tulips or south sea investment opportunities of
yesterday.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Global markets give a global interdependence. Again economists are
still arguing whether this gives the global economy a new robustness
or a new vulnerability. The rapid recovery of the Asian markets is
seen as a sign of the benefits of global markets - but there are
those that would argue that the current recovery has slowed the
market reforms that were needed in Asia in general, and Japan in
particular, thus setting the world up for a deeper depression when
the next fall comes. What no one disputes is the importance of Asian
economies to the world and also to the security picture for the
future.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Population</B></P>

<P>	India passed the one billion people mark sometime last month.
With China, it represents a third of the world's population. Growth
rates are declining everywhere, yet for the developing world they
remain positive. The world's population looks set to stabilise and
even start to decline by the end of the next century, but in the
meantime there will have been some significant demographic changes.
India will probably become the most populous country around 2030. The
European countries may be having a different sort of population
crisis if they continue to have negative growth rates. The divided
between rich and poor states may be magnified by these differential
population growth rates. All of these strains, with their security
implications may be further exacerbated by environmental problems.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Environment, Resources &amp; Energy</B></P>

<P>	Environmental issues are becoming a growing part of the wider
definition of security. Global warming may effect available land in
places like Bangladesh. It may affect food availability in developing
countries more adversely.  Pollution of air or water can become a
threat to neighbours. The forest fires of Indonesia hardly help
relations with its neighbours, but may also have wider implications
for the atmosphere - as is of course also the case with the Brazilian
rain forests. We have seen that industrial fishing can take fish
stocks below the level of viability. The Labrador fisheries are now
dead. Again this can be a source for conflict. The intensity of
commercial operations, the need for fresh water, the growing
populations and the need to raise living standards are problems which
come together across much of Asia. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>It will not be possible for the rich nations to hold back the
aspirations of the poor nations. Yet the consequences in terms of
just energy requirements are of great concern. We shall need to look
at ways of providing the necessary energy without the burning of
carbon - and that probably means a renaissance of nuclear energy,
which brings with another series of potential problems.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Technology</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Technology is seen as the answer to many of these problems. The
connected world has fuelled the aspirations of individuals. It may be
that television contributed to the end of the Soviet Union. Certainly
the worldwide information networks now make it increasingly difficult
for totalitarian regimes to hide the truth from their peoples.
Biotechnology may certainly offer hope in terms of combating disease
and increasing food supplies, but it has a black side as well.
Technology is offering poor states and non State actors new
opportunities for weapons that can threaten the vital interests of
major nations.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>WMD</B></P>

<P>	That brings me back to my opening remarks about the three areas
of potential conflict. India and Pakistan have been nuclear weapon
states for a long time, but neither had previously felt it necessary
to declare themselves as such. The optimist would argue that they
have improved deterrence by their tests; the pessimists would say
that they are their systems are not well controlled and a nuclear war
has become more likely. North Korea has been working hard to achieve
a nuclear capability. It has almost certainly a biological and
chemical capability, and the targets in South Korea are not difficult
to reach. Of great concern has been its involvement of Japan by
testing its new missiles in that direction. Japan must be feeling
increasingly beleaguered with this, with its internal WMD developing
group who used sarin gas in the Tokyo underground. The group had also
tried to get samples of the ebola virus for biological attacks. It
will also worry about the China - Taiwan situation.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	It appears that China is having a considerable internal debate
over how to handle Taiwan. If it were to attack, it would place not
just the United States but also Europe in a very interesting
position. The states that came together to throw Iraq out of Kuwait
are also largely the same states that went to war in Kosovo for human
rights. Taiwan is a vibrant democratic place with a great deal of
commercial activity in America and Europe. China continues to fall
far short of the norms of human rights that the world community now
expects. It is difficult to see how the states who fought for the
Kosovar Albanians could stand by and watch the military conquest of
Taiwan. The consequences of such a confrontation are incalculable.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>China</B></P>

<P>Indeed in any look to the future the developments in China are
key. The West often seems to work on the principle of hope rather
than realism. We are in a difficult period at the moment where the US
is becoming more cautious in its relationships with China, and China
is flexing its muscles. Whether, this can be made even more difficult
by a warming of Sino-Russian relationships is questionable. We should
not forget that whatever their economic situation both remain nuclear
powers.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Conclusion</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In any look at the future of global security, there are two major
unknowns: China and America. How each of these key states evolve will
determine the way the world is. Perhaps the lesson for the European
states is that they must work together as a region if they are to
have any chance in influencing the future international scene. Europe
will be more populous than the US, more wealthy than either the US or
China, but is pathetically weaker in foreign and security policy and
unity of view over its vital interests. I look forward greatly to
hearing from all the expertise that we have assembled here at Queen's
to answer some of these questions.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
