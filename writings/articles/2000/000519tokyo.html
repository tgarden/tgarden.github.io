<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Future Security Needs</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"> Our security throughout Europe in the
traditional sense is now greater than at any time this century. I am
struck by how much this is accepted by European citizens, whereas
there seems to be a quite different feeling in the United States,
where security threats are often perceived as being on the increase.
Of course security is a much wider issue than just assessment of
threats to territory: we may feel increasing concerns about
environmental problems or crime or disease.  However the focus for
the EU approach to a Common Foreign &amp; Security Policy (CFSP) is
still seen in  traditional diplomatic and military terms.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The evidence of need for military forces in
the post Cold War world is overwhelming. NATO has moved with
surprising speed to readjust to the new realities. Its contribution
through its various Partnership for Peace activities, through
enlargement, the new strategic concept and the operation in Kosovo
have all demonstrated that it has a continuing important role  in
extending peace and security. Yet to many, both inside and outside of
Europe, it is seen as an increasingly unbalanced Alliance. The US
preeminence in capability causes a number of tensions on both sides
of the Atlantic about burden-sharing, decision-making and
influence.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In  looking at how Europe is moving towards
developing its own regional view of security, and providing the
capabilities to underpin  those foreign policy drivers, I have no
doubt that NATO remains the key institution within which the European
members will need to operate for the majority of their security
needs. The problems ahead include developing working mechanisms to
achieve a common EU view on foreign and security policy issues, and
producing some real diplomatic and military capability to underpin
the policy. Both of these aspects are difficult for the EU. We also
have changes since the end of the Cold War, which have left Europe
with its forces wrongly structured for the new doctrine and new
challenges.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Europe seems suddenly to have accelerated in
its pursuit of a more coherent approach to the requirement for a
common  foreign and security policy. The UK's recent change in
position has much to do with this. Part of the reason for this change
of heart has been the experience of operations over the last
decade.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Lessons of the 90's</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"> 	The end of the Cold War left  Europe  with
a vast and expensive set of military forces, which had been
practising to fight a single campaign for over 40 years. For Western
Europe, the planning assumptions for an all out war in Europe were
relatively simple. The enemy was well defined and consisted of the
aggregate forces of the  Warsaw Pact. The exact locations, strengths
of forces, tactics to be used and phases of the war were studied by
generations of soldiers. The fall of the Berlin Wall, the unification
of Germany, the demise of the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union, all
changed the strategic landscape in Europe in little more than a 3
year period. The decade of the 90's has seen more diverse military
action by the Western nations, under various banners, than at any
time previously.  Kuwait, Iraq, Somalia, Rwanda, Bosnia, Haiti,
Albania, Kosovo and now East Timor have seen western military force
deployed to less than benign environments. A new doctrine for peace
support operations has replaced the manuals on flexible response in
the military staff colleges of the Alliance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	This series of military and diplomatic
adventures is sufficient now to have established a strong consensus
on the new rationale for NATO, which was articulated in the Strategic
Concept launched at the NATO summit in Washington in April 1999. The
ever increasing data from real operations, rather than deterrence
postures, has also highlighted the major shortcomings in the security
capabilities available to the Alliance for these new tasks. The Gulf
War, while not a NATO operation, was conducted by an ad hoc coalition
drawn for the most part from NATO members.  The then novel doctrine
of a prolonged air campaign was tested successfully.  Lack of
casualties to the allies made the 6 weeks of offensive air action
acceptable to politicians and public.  The much greater availability
of precision guidance for bombs had also set a precedent in terms of
what was acceptable collateral damage in this type of operation. The
4 days of ground war reinforced this new vision of  war: ground
forces sent in only when it was safe to secure the victory that had
been won  relatively bloodlessly from the air. Somalia reinforced the
perception internationally that the US was only prepared to remain
engaged if their troops were kept safe. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The sequence of events in Bosnia developed
the US the view that offensive airpower could provide the necessary
coercion to bring recalcitrant leaders to the negotiating table.
Operation Alba, the response to the breakdown of law and order in
Albania, showed that there were crises which required a European 
response. In this case, it was clear that the mechanisms for putting
together such a coalition were imperfect, and that it was only
possible because of  the relatively benign environment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The 1999 Kosovo air campaign brought
together all the political and military lessons that had been learned
in the post Cold War operations. The contributions from the European 
NATO nations which took part were varied, but all were overshadowed
by the US. Europe was shown to be good at providing political support
for the operation, but incompetent at contributing to the air
campaign in a significant way. The difficulties in raising ground
force numbers, even for an operation in a relatively  benign
environment, suggested that the armies of  Europe were as badly
structured as those of the air forces. </FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Europe as a Strategic Power	</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Does any of this matter? It is sometimes
argued that there is no need to change the current arrangements for
security within Europe. NATO served the continent well throughout the
Cold War, and has reinvented itself to adapt to the security needs of
the post Cold War era. Indeed the enlargement of NATO, the new
strategic concept and the recognition of the needs of a European
Defence and Security Identity within NATO are all a part of a new
security structure for Europe. The question is whether this process
of development within the NATO structure is sufficient for the
future. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Europe is an economic power, but it is a
long way from being a strategic power.  For the 21st Century, it
seems inconceivable that a region which is as rich and populous as
the United States can expect to continue its foreign and security
policy on either an exclusively  national basis or only through NATO.
As we have seen from Bosnia and Kosovo, Europe must shape its
security strategy  always mindful of how it will play in the US
Congress. Looking to the longer term, NATO remains important (and
more secure after Kosovo), but there is no guarantee that it will
remain in existence for ever. Had the Kosovo operation ended in
failure, the future utility of NATO would have been very much in
doubt. There will doubtless be other tests of Alliance cohesion in
the years ahead.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Improving  European Capability</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The question  is how  to develop a
European Foreign and Security Policy which is underpinned by the
necessary diplomatic and military capability to implement it. We need
a design which maintains and supports NATO but gives us a European
capability to protect and promote European vital interests. The
arguments too often revolve around the institutional debates.
Arguments over the linkages between NATO, WEU, and the EU have done
little to advance the military capability available to Europe. The
institutional framework is very important but it is nothing without
the military and diplomatic capability to underpin it. Too often the
institutional debate revolves around how to give Europe a greater
voice in the deployment of US assets. What needs to be addressed is
how to provide more European useful capability, and then how it
should be organised in both a NATO and an EU context.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">		The EU and the US have GDPs of almost
exactly the same size. Yet EU nations spend only just over half as
much on defence, and then share these smaller resources over twice as
many troops.   Hopes for fixing the problems of European defence
capability currently centre on each nation modernising their military
on a national basis. Each nation is expected to transform its forces
into rapidly deployable smaller more flexible units tailored to peace
enforcement. These forces would then be identified by the process
that stems from the Helsinki summit last year.  The EU members agreed
to set themselves an initial goal of providing a force of around
50,000 troops which could be deployed independently at 2 months
notice and sustained for a year on autonomous operations. While this
would certainly offer some extra resources for the types of operation
which are currently being undertaken, it would not greatly improve
the total defence capability that Europe obtains for its vast
expenditure of defence.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Ideally the development of the common
defence policy for the European Union, like the United Kingdom's
recent strategic defence review, should be foreign policy led. The
scale and the scope of the  European armed forces would be determined
by the objectives of foreign policy developed within the CFSP, while
ensuring that  members of the North Atlantic Alliance could meet
their NATO obligations.  The arrival of former Secretary General of
NATO, Javier Solana, as the High Representative for Foreign and
Security Policy in the EU ought to make this easier.This would not
lead to any decoupling of European countries from their NATO
undertakings.  Nor should there be any duplication of the critical
contribution to military co-operation provided by NATO, namely its
command structures and headquarters, although certain developments of
double-hatting could take place.  The most effective way for the
members of the European Union to get more deployable forces for a
Euro is by systematically developing economies of scales in the
support, training and operational management of their armed forces.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">On the political side progress has been
made, particularly through the changes in the UK stance since the
Anglo/French summit at St Malo in December 1998 and the work done
subsequently culminating in the Helsinki  Goals in December
1999.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Can Europe develop a Defence
Capability?</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">While it is relatively easy to construct
theoretical ways forward that would give Europe much better
capability for its defence spending, the reality is likely to be much
less exciting. There is enormous institutional antipathy  to moves
towards greater rationalisation of EU armed forces. Questions about
sovereignty implications give another excuse for little to be done.
Pork barrel politics ensure that equipment spending remains
sub-optimal. It is a measure of how far Europe is from doing anything
significant that  the Helsinki goals will be difficult to achieve by
2003. A region, that spends 170 Bn Euros on defence and has 2 million
men in uniform, struggles to provide a 15 brigade deployable force. 
Those who advocate more spending by Europe an nations on defence are
even less likely to have their hopes realised. In any event a Europe
that spends so ineffectively on defence would not be helped by just
wasting more money.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">There is a real danger that the Helsinki
goals will be used as an excuse by nations to do even less. If this
happens the moves towards European defence capabilities will founder,
like so many of the previous initiatives, and NATO will be weakened
as a result. The key period will be the forthcoming French Presidency
of the EU which begins in July this year. There will need to be a
determined push forward of the Defence agenda if CFSP is to be given
any meaning. This will require the French, British and German
political leadership to take some difficult decisions.</FONT></P>
