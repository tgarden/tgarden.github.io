<H2><CENTER>SOVIET NUCLEAR STRATEGY</CENTER></H2>

<P>Much has been written in the West about the overall strategy of
the Soviet Union for the employment of its nuclear weapons.An
analysis of the public pronouncements of the leaders of a closed
society, the unclassified military manuals, the editorials of the
state controlled press, and the writings of dissidents is unlikely to
provide the complete picture. Experts in the We stare unable to agree
about such basic points as the future military intentions of the
Soviet Union: whether they are offensive or defensive.</P>

<P>While it may not be possible to determine their intentions, it is
possible to draw broad conclusions on Soviet philosophy for the use
of nuclear weapons, from their force structure both now and in the
past.</P>

<H3><CENTER>STALIN AND NUCLEAR INFERIORITY</CENTER></H3>

<P>The decision to build the Soviet atomic bomb was taken in the
summer of 1942.(1) The Soviet reaction to the Baruch Plan for the
international control of atomic weapons in 1946 ensured that it would
fail. Stalin saw the turmoil at the end of World War II as an
opportunity for expanding the Communist empire.The forces of the
United States and Western Europe had been massively demobilised,
while the Soviet forces had not. Stalin's major test of the resolve
of the West was the Berlin Blockade in 1948. That he chose not to use
his superior conventional strength and tactical position suggests a
concern for nuclear vulnerability.</P>

<P>The Soviet strategy for the period when it had no strategic
nuclear capability appears to have been one of exploiting
advantageous but low risk situations. It was not prepared to risk a
full scale conflict with a United States which could use nuclear
weapons with impunity. The large conventional forces must be kept in
being while the nuclear capability was developed- The first
successful test of an atomic device took place on 23 September 1949.

<H3><CENTER>KHRUSHCHEV AND STRATEGIC CAPABILITY</CENTER></H3>

<P>By 1955, Nikita Khrushchev had emerged as the major figure of the
Soviet leadership. At the same time, they were at last gaining a
strategic nuclear capability, which, however inferior,they were
prepared to brandish. Bulganin told Eden of Britain's vulnerability
to attack using 'rocket technique' should Britain continue the Suez
operation.(2) While the British may not have taken this threat
seriously in 1956, the launch of Sputnik the following year made the
world realise the new strategic capabilities of the Soviet Union.
</P>

<P>Khrushchev made it absolutely clear that he considered the nuclear
strategic missile to be the cornerstone of his military policy. In
his statement to the Supreme Soviet in 1960, he proposed reducing the
armed forces by 1,200,000 men and disposing of military aviation and
surface ships. The strategic rocket forces would make the current
structure unnecessary:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>In our time a country's defence
capacity is determined not by the number of soldiers it has under
arms, the number of men in uniform. Aside from the general political
and economic factors about which I have already spoken, a country's
defence capacity depends to a decisive extent upon the firepower and
the means of delivery it has.(3)</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Although some reductions were made, the opposition of the military
establishment and the Berlin and Cuba crises prevented Khrushchev
from fulfilling his aim. There is little doubt that he considered the
strategic rocket forces to be an overwhelming deterrent to external
aggression. Hannes Adomeit concludes that Khrushchev deduced the
effectiveness of deterrence from the lack of retribution in August
1961,following the building of the Berlin Wall. This then encouraged
him to attempt to present a second fait accompli in Cuba,having
resumed weapon testing as a forceful reminder of Soviet
capabilities.(4) If this analysis is correct, as seems possible, then
the Soviet strategy was one of opportunistic action under the~cover
of nuclear retaliatory threat. The military view differed~greatly
from the political doctrine of the overriding importance of nuclear
fire-power over manpower. Many leading figures of the Soviet military
establishment made clear their belief in the need for a grand
war-fighting capability.(5)</P>

<H3><CENTER>BREZHNEV AND NUCLEAR PARITY</CENTER></H3>

<P>Following the fall of Khrushchev in 1964, the military view of the
need for strong conventional forces coupled with strong nuclear
forces prevailed. It is evident that achieving parity with the United
States was the first priority. By the start of the Strategic Arms
Limitation Talks (SALT) in Helsinki in late 1969, the Soviet Union
had agreed with the United States on the existence of and the need to
preserve parity, mutual deterrence and strategic stability.(6) In
fact, because of delays to the SALT process as a result of the
invasion of Czechoslovakian 1968, when the agreement was made the
numbers of launchers permitted gave the Soviets a numerical
superiority in this area.</P>

<P>The agreements to arms limitations did not mean that the Soviets
accepted the American concept of mutual assured destruction. The
Soviet military writings, the political statements and the force
structure all appear to be internally consistent with the view that
nuclear weapons are seen as an essential part of the preparations for
war. Joseph Douglass, in his <I>Soviet Strategy for Nuclear War</I>,
draws extensively on the classified organ of the Soviet General
Staff, '<I>Voyennaya mysl</I>',which was passed to the West by
Penkovsky. Quotes from this source give an indication of the
development of current Soviet strategy:</P>

<P><I>&nbsp;</I></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>The most important task of the General
Staff in preparing for modern war is the detailed employment of
nuclear weapons by all services of the armed forces.(Major General N.
Komkov, October 1964) (7)</I></P>

<P><I>For the achievement of victory in a present-day nuclear war, if
it is unleashed by the imperialists, not only the enemy's armed
forces, but also the sources of his military power and state control
as well as areas where different branches of the armed forces are
based, will be subjected to simultaneous destruction.(Colonel M.
Shirokov April 1968)(8)</I></P>

<P><I>In view of the immense destructive force of nuclear weapons and
the extremely limited time available to take effective
countermeasures after an enemy launches its missiles, the launching
of the first massed attack acquires decisive importance for achieving
the objectives of war.(Marshal of the Soviet Union K. Moshalenko
January 1969) (9)</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>These writings from closed circulation journals do not differ in
philosophy from open publications. The policy is further confirmed by
the force structure. The strategic rocket forces form a separate arm
of the armed forces; active defence against air attack is widely
deployed; and civil defence measures have been widely implemented.
Irrespective of the effectiveness of these measures, the resources
devoted to them show that the Soviet view of deterrence is
significantly different from the American one. It is usually
described as 'deterrence by denial',rather than the West's doctrine
of deterrence by punishment. (10) The demonstrated capability and
willingness to fight a nuclear war, and hence deny a victory to the
enemy, acts as the deterrent to aggression. What we can glean of
their targeting doctrine from quotations, such as those of Colonel
Shirokov above, is that it is entirely counter-force. That large
cities will contain points of 'military and state control', ensures
that the collateral damage would be as great as that from a
counter-value targeting doctrine.</P>

<P>It does not necessarily follow, as is sometimes suggested, that a
force posture and doctrine for nuclear war fighting mean~that the
Soviets believe they can use nuclear war as a~instrument of policy,
or could win, in any meaningful sense, an all out nuclear war. Robert
Arnett, after studying Soviet pronouncements, concludes that they are
acutely aware of the American capability to inflict unacceptable
damage.(11) The doctrine of fighting a war, rather than mutual
vulnerability, is necessary both for ideological reasons, and for
morale,especially in the military.</P>

<P>If they do not believe that their nuclear forces can be sensibly
used to achieve a victory, then why did they engage on the massive
build up in the second half of the 1960s, and why the comprehensive
modernisation programme in progress now?Professor Erickson identifies
three possible explanations for the first expansion.(12) Firstly, it
could have been an attempt to achieve stability through parity.
Secondly, it may have been an attempt to achieve strategic advantage
as part of a master plan.The third possibility, which he favours, is
that it proceeded without any well defined single objective, as a
result of the various institutional pressures and interests at work
within the Soviet system. Brian Crozier strongly favours the master
plan concept, and quotes a leaked intelligence report of Brezhnev's
address to the East European communist leaders in 1973.(13) At this
meeting, Brezhnev is said to have spoken of a decisive shift in the
correlation of forces, such that by 1985, they could exert their will
whenever they needed to.</P>

<P>Whatever the true motives, the Soviet armoury is entirely logical
in their terms. They may not want a nuclear war, but they realise
that it could happen. In that event, they would wish to limit the
damage to themselves, and would also wish to emerge as the most
powerful of the survivors. To this end an offensive war-waging
capability, which is superior to the potential enemy, is a logical
posture. Active and passive defences improve prospects of recovery.
</P>

<P>The Soviet strategy differs from the American in how nuclear war
is likely to be conducted, should deterrence fail.The early use of
decisive fire-power is basic to the doctrine; and the relatively high
dependence on vulnerable land-based ICBMs suggests that they would be
used in a first strike, or in a launch on warning role. Certainly the
NATO concept of an escalating limited nuclear war is totally
discounted:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>As a matter of fact, there can be in
general no 'limited' nuclear war. If a nuclear war breaks out,
whether it be in Europe or in any other place, it would inevitably
and unavoidably assume a worldwide character ... So, those who
possibly hope to set fire to the nuclear powder-keg,while themselves
sitting to one side, should not entertain any illusions.(L.I.
Brezhnev)(14)</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The American proposals of a change of strategy to strategic
defence is no more welcome to the Soviet leadership:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>Should this conception be converted
into reality, this would actually open the floodgates of a runaway
race of all types of strategic arms, both offensive and
defensive.Such is the real purport, the seamy side, so to say, of
Washington's 'Defensive conception'.(Y. Andropov)(15)</I></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><CENTER>FUTURE TRENDS</CENTER></H3>

<P>It is difficult to imagine any radical change in Soviet nuclear
strategy, especially while the old guard retain the reigns of power.
It has been remarkably consistent and, some might suggest~ more
successful at instilling fear in its enemies than the American
strategy in recent years. Paul Nitze has suggested six main Soviet
objectives for the 1980s: the separation of NATO Europe from the US;
increase of influence in the Persian Gulf;encirclement and
neutralisation of China; subversion in the West, particularly the
Caribbean; ability to deal with direct East/west military
confrontation if necessary; and finally, the improvement of the
Soviet image as a responsible participant of the international
community.(16) An increasing conventional and nuclear superiority, to
give deterrence by denial, and a damage limiting doctrine should
deterrence fail, would not be at variance with these aims.</P>
