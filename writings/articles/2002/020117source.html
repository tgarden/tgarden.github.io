			<h3>Guantanamo and Geneva </h3>

			<p>The international concerns over the Bush Administration's approach to prisoners taken during the operations in Afghanistan grow. A prison camp has been set up in the tiny US military zone of Guantanamo Bay at the eastern end of Cuba. It may have come as a surprise to many to be reminded that this base area exists on what is almost the last remnant of the Communist empire. However its unusual status, as not part of the USA but under American control, has a part play in this saga. The questions that are currently being asked are important. What is the legal position of the captives?  Are they being treated correctly under international or national law? How will they be prosecuted? What are the implications for future operations? What should the British Government do about its own nationals held prisoner, and about the wider aspects of international law and human rights?<br>
				<br>
				Doubtless many of these questions will exercise international lawyers for years to come. International law in some respects is an inexact science. It does however have a number of key widely agreed documents and protocols. Of these the Geneva Conventions, the Protocols and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are perhaps the most important underpinning of the moves towards building a global view on how captives must be treated. The US has said that its prisoners are &quot;illegal combatants&quot;. This is not a designation recognised by international law. During an armed conflict combatants are permitted to take a direct part in hostilities, and if captured becomes prisoners of war (POWs). They then are treated according to the requirements of the Geneva Convention. If they are not combatants then they lose the POW protected status, and must be prosecuted as criminals for any attacks on people or property. None of this requires a declaration of war between the fighting parties. The US declaration of a war on terrorism has merely added a layer of confusion. As we remember the Falklands Conflict of 20 years ago, this was always carefully described as a conflict rather than a war.  Nevertheless when Argentinean soldiers were captured, they had to be treated as POWs despite the difficulties that posed for the advancing British forces.<br>
				<br>
				In counter-terrorism operations, it has been the British practice to be very careful not to give captured terrorists the status of POWs. The Northern Ireland operation has been conducted by the police, with the support of military forces, as a campaign against terrorism as a crime.  The American operation in Afghanistan has elements of both a formal military campaign and also a counter-terrorism operation. Thus many of the al-Qaeda supporters captured may have been fighting to defend Taliban held territory  or may have been terrorists hiding in Tora Bora. They may of course have been both (or indeed neither). The USA was conducting a military operation which gave every appearance of being a war. Uniformed military personnel were deployed with lethal force and one of their aims was to replace the government of Afghanistan, which they duly did. International law would probably recognise the formed Taliban armed defenders as having combatant status. Since their leadership called on them to fight to throw out the US led forces, they would be the equivalent of territorial part-time defence units even if they had other jobs. It is likely therefore that at least some of those captured will be entitled to POW status.<br>
				<br>
				What practical effect does the third Geneva Convention have on the way the residents of Camp X-Ray, Guantanamo Bay  should be treated? The camp meets the requirement to be located out of harm's way.  The accommodation should be of the same general standard as that enjoyed by the forces of the captor. So either, the US marines will have to take the roof off their barrack blocks, or there needs to be an upgrade in the weather protection of the cages. Medical care must be provided, as must food and water. We have no reason to doubt that these standards will be met by the US, although the Convention requires that the normal diet of the prisoners must be taken into account. They should be given a &quot;capture card&quot; to let next of kin know how they are. This does not appear to have happened. They are not obliged to give information beyond their name, rank and number, and this may be a real problem for the US interrogators. The ICRC must be allowed regular access to the prisoners.<br>
				<br>
				If the US takes the view that none of its captives are POWs, then the fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 comes into play. Here there is a series of rights of due process such as presumption of innocence, fair trial, and the ability to make defence arrangements.  None of this seems to have worried Defense Secretary Rumsfeld who has publicly made known his lack of concern about the captives' conditions. The arrangements for secret military tribunals do little to reassure the international community.<br>
				<br>
				 It looks as though we may be going down another US led path on international treaties which will make us all less safe. First it was arms control for the chop, next the environment and now the humane conduct of warfare. The growing storm over the ruling against the USA by the World Trade Organisation on tax breaks may be the next issue to hit us. The unity of purpose between Europe and the USA after 11 September may not last much longer.<br>
