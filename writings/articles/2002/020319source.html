			<h3>Both Hands in the Afghan Mangle</h3>

			<p>Just before Christmas, the Chief of the Defence Staff, Admiral Sir Michael Boyce, gave a public warning about the problems of overcommitment of British Forces. He was thinking particularly of the requirements in Afghanistan. The British Government wanted to rebuild this war-torn lawless country, and that would require a stabilising force, just as we had seen in the Balkans. Peacekeeping takes years and needs enough dedicated, patient and experienced troops to enforce the rule of law, and train the local army and police. UK forces, already under strength, were in short supply after contributions to Bosnia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Sierra Leone, East Timor, and the continuing demands of Northern Ireland. Admiral Boyce made it surprisingly clear that there were difficult strategic choices facing the UK. It might choose to do the warfighting or to do the nation building, but trying to do everything was not always going to be possible. His views on UK forces in Afghanistan are very relevant as the Government announces a new large deployment for combat:</p>
			<address>&quot;Whatever the choices we make, and for whatever reason, we must ensure that those decisions maintain our freedom of strategic choice; but we will have to decide soon whether we make a commitment to a broader campaign (widening the war), or make a longer  term commitment to Afghanistan. Recent military success must be capitalised upon, so it is not a question of whether we will trap our hand in the mangle, but of which mangle we trap it in: My aim, incidentally, is not to get fixed in Afghanistan, - but - if I have to address the causes of terrorism, I may have to. But the strategic risks are obvious: - a UK military footprint might broaden the pan-Islamic perception of invasion; variations in loss of consent between traditionally bellicose factions might lead to mission creep and the dangers of peace enforcement, loss of impartiality and perceived clientism; resources might be diverted from priority missions; we might have a reticent and inadequate transition by the UN, leading to an unattainable exit strategy or end state - and all of this added together resulting in inevitable strategic failure and all that that might entail.&quot; </address>
			<p>On Monday, Geoff Hoon, the Defence Secretary startled the House of Commons by announcing that a Commando battlegroup was being sent urgently to work with US, Canadian and others for combat operations against Al Qaida and Taliban in Afghanistan. He left the House in no doubt that this was a major commitment (the largest deployment of ground forces to combat since the Gulf War), and that it would be an operation which carried significant risk of casualties. The battlegroup will total some 1700 personnel. They will join a US-led brigade to undertake combat operations. This is in addition to and separate from the 1800 British troops with the International Security Force in Kabul. British policy is now to have both hands firmly in Admiral Boyce's mangle. The UK is still in the lead for the nation building troops, and will now be a significant part of the ground combat forces continuing the war. </p>
			<p>There are no real technical problems with conducting both roles. However, there may be dangers if the battlegroup find themselves fighting Afghan nationals (either deliberately or accidentally), and the peacekeeping troops are then seen by Kabul residents as part of a hostile force. The US has been careful to keep its troops in the background of ISAF activities. On the other hand, the UK's promise of handing over the lead of ISAF after 3 months is proving difficult to deliver. It may be that Turkey will take this on shortly, but it has yet to be finally tied up. Some reductions  will be possible as the Germans take over an ISAF subordinate headquarters. </p>
			<p>The most intriguing question is why we are sending the commando battlegroup at all. According to Geoff Hoon, it is in response to a formal request from the United States. Yet the Pentagon briefing on Tuesday announces that the main operation (Anaconda) against remnants of Al Qaida and Talban is now complete. While Brigadier General Rosa giving the briefing said that pursuit would continue, he had no major new operations to announce. He was forced to admit that he was unaware of the previous  day's announcement  about new British contributions. His reply to a reporter's question as to whether the UK coming in was the sign of a major push was:</p>
			<address>&quot; I don't think it would be characterised as a 'major push'. And I had not seen that announcement. I knew there were folks coming in, but we've always, from this podium, let those countries characterize their own contribution. But as far as some major push or something like that, Charlie, it's - - </address>
			<address>Reporter: No final push? &#150;</address>
			<address>BG Rosa: No. No. &quot;</address>
			<p>The conspiracy theorists will see the new deployment as testing the water for our involvement in Iraq. Or alternatively the MoD is making a watertight case for a significant uplift of funds in the spending review. The British Commandos are very good at cold weather mountain operations, but they are being sent just as the snow starts to melt. The US does not seem to think the contribution is significant, but we see it as momentous. There are many questions to be answered. Parliament may wonder why a  Pentagon Brigadier knew &quot;there were folks coming in&quot;, but Geoff Hoon couldn't find time to brief the Opposition spokesmen ahead of the announcement.  It is all very peculiar. <br>
				<br>
				Perhaps we should now press the US to reciprocate. If European forces are helping with the warfighting, it might be the time to ask the Americans to provide some forces to help build the peace in Afghanistan.</p>
