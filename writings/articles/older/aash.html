<H3><CENTER>The Roles of Support Helicopters</CENTER></H3>

<ADDRESS><CENTER>Military Helicopter Conference -  February 1993
</CENTER></ADDRESS>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>It is often said, that the Support Helicopter has been the
Cinderella of military capabilities. Some have blamed this on its
very flexibility: spanning the needs of air, ground and maritime
forces, without one Service to back equipment programmes ahead of all
the other competing needs for resources. Perhaps, there is an element
of truth in this. However there are other reasons, the transport
helicopter is no more than a truck in terms of what it can carry; and
 carries much less than a cargo ship or a  jumbo jet. At the same
time it is expensive to buy, expensive to maintain and expensive to
operate. You will not be surprised that in my current appointment, I
highlight the cost of support helicopters at the start. All defence
programmers are in the business of making balance of investment
judgements. What is it that makes it worth putting large resources
into helicopters rather than other military equipment? Looking at the
programme of speakers throughout this conference, I think we will
come away with a number of answers. My test with each one will be to
ask: do we expect to be involved in the particular area of
operations? How many ways can the operation be done? What is the most
cost-effective mix of systems? Nor should we forget to ask whether
the task need be carried out by a military helicopter at all.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Strategic Context</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Before we look at the many ways that helicopters can be used to
support military operations, it is important to consider the effect
that the changes on the international security scene will have on our
future requirements. On the one hand, Western defence forces are
being significantly scaled down: smaller forces, fewer permanently
deployed outside national boundaries, smaller budgets and much lower
risks of a major direct threats. On the other, since the end of the
Cold War, the world has hardly become more peaceful. Nations have
internal security problems, border disputes, economic concerns,
international treaty obligations, legacies of Empire and moral
responsibilities to relieve suffering. For all these activities, they
look to their armed forces to provide capabilities. A common theme of
operations in this new strategic environment is the difficulties of
contingency planning. In the days of the NATO/Warsaw Pact
confrontation, planners had years to establish their logistic support
arrangements, plan their defensive positions, calculate their road
movement plan. Today we expect our forces to be able to go at short
notice, to unfamiliar terrain, work with ad-hoc coalitions of
nations, against a range of adversaries from military states equipped
with the latest technology to that enemy called nature - earthquake,
flood, famine, hurricane or volcanic eruption. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>It is easy to deduce from this, that the transport helicopter has
an increasing importance. It does not, except in a very small way,
depend on the terrain. Minefields or floods can all be passed. It is
fast in operations, and reasonably quick in deployment ( very fast if
airportable). However, the analysis is more complex than this. If the
number of forces is decreasing, and the budgets with them, is the net
effect a growth or decline in military helicopter requirements? Do
the helicopters need to be military for all these tasks? What size -
or sizes - of helicopter is the optimum? What are the trade-offs
between survivability, stealth and operational concepts? Since old
helicopters seem to go on forever, what is the advantage of changing
to new models? </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I am asking questions rather than answering them because I hope
our sessions over the next two days will start to inform us on the
answers. The answers will of course be different for different
nations. It depends to some extent how the armed forces are
structured and equipped today, and what roles they may expect to be
sent on in the future. What I should like to do now is look briefly
at each of these roles to see what further issues arise. Most will be
covered by examples from our other presenters. I hope that their
examples will help to answer some of the difficult questions which I
shall pose.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Logistics Support</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The primary use for support helicopters is as a part of the
logistic supply chain. They can carry forward the fuel, ammunition,
and stores  from the rear  area, from the port or from the airfield
or from the dump, forward to the user. Typically, a series of
racetrack patterns of resupply will be set up. Large helicopters to
take forward the heavy loads of stores, probably underslung, to
forward distribution points. From there it may be possible to break
out the supplies and redistribute by vehicle to the combat troops, or
use smaller, and less vulnerable, helicopters for the supply of the
gun batteries or whatever. In looking at this role we need to
consider the trade offs between the greater speed and flexibility of
helicopter delivery against the battlefield vulnerability, and the
supporting organisation that is needed. Helicopters, like all
aircraft, are great consumers of fuel and a complex organisation is
needed to provide them with fuel in the field. An extended
communications arrangement can also be manpower intensive, although
this may become less of a problem with the advent of tactical
satellite communications.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In looking at providing for logistic support, an analysis of the
likely length of the tactical lines of communication and the scale
and structure of the combat forces is needed. This is of course very
difficult today where UN operations are the order of the day. If the
environment is relatively benign then large helicopters are likely to
be more cost effective, able to carry heavier loads over greater
distances with smaller fleet sizes and hence lower support costs. In
a fighting war, then the advantages of the large lifter must be
balanced against its greater vulnerability in the forward area. This
is not just a question of its size as a target, it is also a question
of unloading times - and again there are trade-offs between
underslung loads giving greater vulnerability en route, but far
quicker unloading times for stores. There is also the greater loss
when a large helicopter is hit.  Finally there is the question of
availability of logistic support helicopters for other tasks. Here
the concept of operations is important. Permanently dedicated air
support of any  kind is never the most efficient answer, although it
will always be the most attractive to the local commander who has
such support.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Casualty Evacuation</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>One task that we can be sure the logistic support helicopters can
do as well is that of casualty evacuation. Nations have planned on
using the empty aircraft returning from the battle zone as the
obvious means of bringing casualties back to be dealt with in the
rear zone. In the past this has been a bonus, with the logistics
support requirement driving the fleet size. It may be that as part of
the greater Western public sensitivity on casualties, the
arrangements for fast evacuation of casualties to competent medical
facilities will assume increasing importance. Certainly the
availability of helicopters in this role is an important aspect of
planning for any operation.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Airmobility</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>One of the great hopes for the development of the helicopter as a
key element of military capability has been its promise of giving
ground forces the mobility of naval and air forces. Much work has
gone into the development of airmobile operations.  We shall hear of
some of the UK thinking on this later in the morning, and I will not
steal John Goodsir's thunder. I will just pose some of the questions
which airmobile operations must raise in a nation's procurement plans
for support helicopters. The primary issue must be the concept of
operations. The term airmobility is used by some to cover a range of
activities from the leisurely emplacement of ground forces in
defensive positions using helicopter lift, right through to air
cavalry offensive operations using attack helicopters with their
support equally airmobile. Having decided what concept is
appropriate, each nation or alliance must decide what scale of
capability is required, and for how long it must be sustained. Again
there are issues of concurrency. If an airmobile force is to be used
as a very flexible reserve, can its helicopters be used elsewhere
while the reserve is uncommitted? If the airmobile force is to be
used more as a lead offensive arm to what extent does it need
dedicated support helicopters? Are their characteristics different
from those needed from the more mundane logistics support task? Do
they need to be armed?</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Amphibious Operations</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Staying with the use of helicopters in the high intensity conflict
end of the spectrum, we must not forget their importance in
amphibious operations. There are many similarities to airmobile
operations with the start point at sea instead of on land. That is of
course a gross oversimplification as I am sure my Marine colleagues
will tell me. In any event the sustaining of the amphibious force
remains a key driver for continuing helicopter support. The question
is whether, apart from the need for protection from salt water
corrosion,  the support helicopters for amphibious operations need to
be different from those for airmobility. If they do not, what
assumptions in the new world can one make about concurrency of tasks?
In the past NATO had to plan on amphibious operations in Norway at
the same time as airmobile operations in Germany.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Special Forces</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>We will hear later this morning about Special Forces operations.
The helicopter is an ideal vehicle for covert operations. However,
for operations behind enemy lines it needs every assistance that
technology can give it for survival. Pinpoint navigation is a key,
night operations essential, self-contained sustainability - in
particular as far as fuel goes. Very low level at night in hostile
territory is demanding stuff, and it is perhaps an appropriate time
to mention the importance of training. This is not a role that anyone
can do at the drop of a hat, and requires specially dedicated crews.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Counter-Terrorism</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Moving away from the high intensity conflict side of operations,
Northern Ireland is the greatest user of support helicopter lift as
far as the United Kingdom is concerned. In counter-terrorism
operations of any sort, the helicopter offers enormous advantages. It
allows safe movement from one secure area to another, and it allows
rapid response to terrorist activity which is by its nature
unpredictable. The characteristics of those helicopters needed for
NATO operations are likely to be sufficient for the counter-terroist
role.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Communications/ air transport</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I note that we do not have a session on the most mundane - but
very frequently used - aspect of support helicopter operations: that
of the helicopter as a transport aircraft. Monarchs and Presidents,
Prime Ministers and Dictators, Ministers and Generals, even radar
technicians for mountain top radar sites, all take advantage of the
unique characteristics of helicopter lift. I will not spend much time
of this role, except to say that it should not be forgotten when one
considers the size of any nation's helicopter forces.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Humanitarian Relief</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Having procured a fleet against these military drivers, more and
more we find it being used in the wider security interest for
humanitarian operations. Again the characteristics required for high
intensity conflict, and the training given to aircrew, will be more
than sufficient for humanitarian operations. I think the key factor
we must weigh in this is the almost universal applicability of
helicopters to such operations. Whether it is getting troops into -
or out of - the disaster area, the delivery of supplies, the
evacuation of refugees, the delivery of negotiators or the evacuation
of casualties, helicopters will be needed. There will never be enough
of them. This gives a particular twist to support helicopter
procurement plans by any nation. Other forms of military capability
may be of use as a contribution to humanitarian relief, helicopters
certainly will. In a world where such uses of military forces become
more and more the norm, there are obvious benefits in ensuring that
such a national capability exists.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Search &amp; Rescue</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>There is one sub-set of humanitarian operations which military
helicopters have been engaged in for a long time, and that is Search
and Rescue. The military need for the rescue of downed aircrew is
well understood and happily not needed too often. The bonus of an
organisation able to rescue climbers, sailors or any civilians in
trouble in otherwise inaccessible places is considerable. When we
consider this aspect of support helicopter operations, it would be
wise to remeber the increasing importance of the rescue of downed
aircrew from hostile territory as this generates similar equipment
and training requirements to those for Special Forces. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Multi-role</H3>

<P>	Before bringing this introductory session to a close, there is
just one another issue that I believe we need to consider over the
next two days. I have treated support helicopters as though they were
just airborne trucks and no more. That is of course not the whole
truth. We see transport helicopters fitted with weapons for self
defence or for offensive action. We have attack helicopters that have
a transport capability. We can fit sensors to helicopters and give
them a photographic, radar or infra-red reconnaissance capability, an
airborne early warning radar, an anti-submarine warfare fit,
air-to-air refuelling probes and drogues, and communications and data
link relay. This is an important element because the trade-offs
between size, numbers and costs is made yet more complicated when we
can start blurring the distinction between roles. </P>

<P> </P>

<H3>The Future</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I have only dipped in to the many roles for support helicopters,
and we will cover a number of them in much greater detail as the
conference continues. My deduction from this brief round-up would be
that,to an extent, the requirement for helicopter lift is robust
against a very wide range of future risk assessments. The same
helicopters can provide essential capability for high intensity
conflict, but are not wasted if the prospect of such conflict
recedes. They are however expensive assets. We need to look carefully
at the balance to be struck between big and small, simple and
technologically advanced, single role and multi role. We also need in
every case to ask the question whether the task can be done in a
different and less expensive way. For most of these tasks the answer
will be no.</P>
