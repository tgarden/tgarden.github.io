			<h3>European Security through American Eyes</h3>
			<h3>The World Today - February 2001</h3>
		</div>
		<p>The United States of America never fails to surprise.  The US President has surprisingly few direct powers: the Founding Fathers were very keen on checks and balances, even if they were a little vague on hanging chads. Yet, twentieth century history is littered with examples of how the President determined the future course of history. The only use of atomic weapons in war was the personal decision of Harry S. Truman. John F.Kennedy might have misjudged his game of nuclear poker with Nikita S. Khrushchev over missiles in Cuba in 1962. Richard M. Nixon was able to bring the Vietnam War to an end, and to engage with China. Perhaps in security matters most of all, the US President can lead his country and sometimes the rest of the world. How will foreign and security policy play in a George W.Bush administration, and what does it mean for Europe?</p>
		<p>Republicans are often characterised as being pro-military and more prepared to use force in the furtherance of US global interests. The historical record is ambiguous. However, we have a number of indicators about the sort of approach that we might expect to security issues.  Proposals to increase planned defence spending are likely. Despite the extraordinary amount (almost $300 billion) spent on defence each year, US forces are not in good shape. Much equipment is old and unreliable and specialist manpower retention is as much an issue as it is in Europe. More importantly, a review of the purpose of US armed forces will be needed. There is talk among some analysts about the need to downgrade the current requirement to prepare for two near simultaneous major regional wars. It will be difficult for a Republican administration to move away from this commitment. Indeed they may argue that it is not demanding enough. The indications are that they will look for some easing of the burden in the low intensity deployed operations in which they are currently enmeshed. This has been trailed by advisers close to Bush, who explain that it is no part of the US military&#146;s role to act as policemen and aid workers in the Balkans. Brainwashed by CNN, many US citizens believe that the world&#146;s trouble spots are exclusively patrolled by Americans. We sometimes suffer from similar delusions in Britain about our own forces. While the US may have provided 80% of the capability for the air campaign in Kosovo, they are already happy for others to provide a similar  majority of the ground forces for post conflict reconstruction today. Nevertheless, it is possible that a timetable for full withdrawal of US forces in the Balkans will be announced. This will be the first of a number of issues that may rattle the transatlantic relationship.</p>
		<p>Warning shots across the bows of the European Union defence project have been sounding since the Nice summit. The US remains uncertain whether Europe doing more in the security field is a good or a bad thing. While the cry for more equitable burden sharing is not new, America would not wish to lose its leadership role in European security. NATO remains the key institution for ensuring that Europe does not wander too far from the US security agenda. It also remains the only military alliance which works, albeit not totally efficiently. The European capability which is developing out of the headline goals agreed by EU states at Helsinki in December 1999 will be a policy issue for the new Bush administration. Turkey is playing its NATO veto card early as part of its somewhat  contradictory strategy towards EU membership. If the US encourages Turkey to be difficult (or does nothing to discourage it), France will be strengthened in its wish for a more independent European military capability. The experience of the Kosovo air campaign left a number of European governments less than enthused by arrangements for US sharing of strategic analysis and planning. All of this could be a recipe for a widening gulf between the EU and the US without careful diplomacy on both sides. </p>
		<p>Within the Bush administration&#146;s term of office, the EU is under remit to produce its reasonably rapidly deployable military capability of up to 60,000 soldiers and their necessary support. It seems unlikely the most demanding capabilities will be fielded by 2003, and it may be that even the basic capabilities turn out to be more limited than claimed. If this should be the case, there will be another cause for criticism by the US. The European members of NATO signed up to the Defence Capabilities Initiative in Washington in April 1999. In this they promised to rectify a very long list of weaknesses in NATO. The Helsinki Goals should have enabled them to meet some of their NATO targets. A failure in the EU force will also mean a failure in NATO. A Bush administration will be torn between a need to devote its military efforts to where it sees the need (almost everywhere except Europe), and a wish to remain preeminent in a viable NATO. </p>
		<p>One other NATO issue will be a source for transatlantic tension: the next stage of enlargement. The Clinton Administration imposed its view of the first phase of enlargement so that Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic were able to join in 1999. It could also be claimed that US views led to the subsequent pause in enlargement activity. European members of NATO, and in particular France, have differed in views over the timing and the candidates for NATO membership. The next round will be even more difficult. With EU enlargement receiving a slightly cloudy green light at the Nice summit, the parallel NATO process is likely to be an issue for this year. Romania and Slovenia are left over business from 1999. There is a strategic argument for filling in some of the gaps on the NATO map, which would include Slovakia and Bulgaria. The neutral EU countries (Austria, Finland, Ireland and Sweden) are now potentially linked through their involvement in EU defence developments. However, the Baltic States will be an issue to be resolved. It seems likely that the Bush administration will not wish to defer to Russian sensitivities, and may want to include some or all of  Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in the next tranche of NATO enlargement. This may not be the way some European states see the future security of the region being best served.</p>
		<p>A more confrontational approach to Russia may also develop over the proposed National Missile Defence system. The Bush administration is deeply committed to moving forward with the NMD project. They have criticised the Clinton programme as inadequate, which may mean that they will need some time to re-evaluate a new approach. What is clear is that they do not intend to be constrained by Russian views. They are prepared to exercise their right to withdraw from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty if the Russians will not agree a suitable amendment to it. Following the refusal by the US Congress to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, this will be taken by many nations as a very unhappy portent for arms control under the Republicans. </p>
		<p>	Some European governments have already indicated their opposition to  NMD. The UK has a direct part to play in any future missile defence architecture. The early warning radar at Fylingdales will need to be rebuilt to house a large radar array in direct contravention of the ABM treaty as currently written. There will also need to be some rather less obvious changes to satellite communication ground stations in the UK. This will present the British government with a policy dilemma. Should it allow the necessary installations as part of the special relationship with the US; while accepting that this might put the UK at risk of preemptive attack? Or should it adopt a position in common with its EU colleagues which recognises the  adverse impact of US NMD on European security; while accepting that it will lose significant clout with the US as a result? Politicians throughout Europe will hope that NMD is played long in the US, and that the final outcome is some variant of a deployable boost phase interception system which is  not in breach of the ABM treaty. They may be disappointed.</p>
		<p>	In sum, the new US administration under George W.Bush is likely to have a profound and unpredictable effect on the future security relationship between Europe and the United States. It is not that the US is becoming more isolationist, but just that it views the world in a different way than do European states. Nor are US national interests and European interests necessarily the same. Either way, Europe may have started thinking about providing for its own contribution to its regional security needs in the nick of time.</p>
