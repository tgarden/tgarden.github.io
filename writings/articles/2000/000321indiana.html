<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Forecasting the Future</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Good Evening from London. When we look at
future security from here in Europe, we see it differently from the
perspective of the US. The UK has in the past been torn between its
cultural and historic links with Ameica, and is geography as a part
of Europe. I shall try to bring out the divergence that we are seeing
in the European and US approaches to security, and what that in turn
means for both regions. Forecasting what the world is going to be
like in this new century is an uncertain art. Unfortunately, crises,
both natural and manmade, emerge so rapidly that predictions are
upset almost as soon as they are made. Predicting the future is
always a somewhat hazardous affair. We extrapolate from recent
experience into the unknown, often coming to quite incorrect
conclusions. So perhaps what I am going to say should be seen as
merely one possible future, and like all security specialists, there
may be a touch of worst case analysis, so that we can prepare and
prevent it coming to pass. Through recent years, we have seen many
predictions of the rise of Asia as an economic power, coupled with a
possible decline in Europe and North America. Through much of the
Cold War, we at times seemed to think that Communism was unstoppable
except by military means: that developing countries would fall like
dominoes if not afforded the protection of the West. Sometimes, we
see similar views being expressed but with Islam replacing communism
as the new unstoppable ideology. Yet the experience of the almost
simultaneous widespread death of ideological communism at the end of
the 80s, coupled with the fall of Asian markets in the 90s have
together given rise to an equally dangerous presumption. There is  a
complacency in some parts of America and Europe that liberal
democracies and market forces are the unstoppable models which will
spread peace, harmony and wealth throughout the globe. We may all
hope that this will be the case, but it is not yet proven.</FONT>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">A New Approach to World Security</FONT>
</H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"> Nevertheless, we may be able to dimly see a
new pattern of international affairs emerging, which may in the end
prove to be a footnote in history, or, as I shall argue, a watershed.
This new pattern will have a profound effect on peace and security
for the World in the coming years. The 90s have been an interesting
decade. The end of the Cold War, the reunification of Germany, the
dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union, and the
accession last year of Poland, Czech Republic and Hungary into NATO
have completely transformed Europe's security. The UK  and the rest
of Europe has not been safer from attack on its territory at any time
in living memory. This is an important factor in differences bewteen
European and American views. In the US, there seems to be a growing
concern about territorial threats from rogue states and terrorism. I
shall return to the implications of this difference. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">It might have been assumed that the
disappearance of a real and urgent military threat from the Soviet
Union would have decreased the military activity of western European
nations. Yet European armed forces have been engaged in more real
military operations in this decade than they were in the four decades
of the Cold War. It is as though the Cold War gave western
democracies an excuse for inaction. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The Gulf War of 1991 set the new agenda
for the international community. That it was possible to assemble so
many participating nations into the ad hoc coalition was of course
made easier by the obvious breach in international law of the
invasion of Kuwait. The success of the Gulf War boosted the
confidence of the international community, that it could right
international wrongs. The effects of the break-up of the Former
Republic of Yugoslavia are not yet finished. Nevertheless Bosnia and
Kosovo have further reinforced a US/European view of how instability
can be contained. The threat and, if necessary, use of force is now
less constrained if the aims of the operation are judged by the major
western powers to be the promoting of justice for individuals. East
Timor  has been a new adventure.The previous embargo on intervention
in the internal affairs of states has been lifted. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	In the UK, our newly elected government in
1997 astonished many by announcing that foreign policy would have an
ethical dimension. Britain had always been seen as essentially a
pragmatic operator on the international scene. Foreign policy was the
promotion of national interest by diplomatic effort with few
absolutes.  As with many of its policies New Labour was in tune with
the times. Kosovo was a humanitarian intervention. A number of
speakers for the far Left and the far Right have pointed out, there
was no direct UK national interest in the internal arrangements of
Kosovo. Such voices were in the minority. Humanitarian action has
been cited in the past as a justification for military action, but
usually in retrospect or in concert with more traditional
justifications of vital interests. Kosovo was different. With a
pretty arguable UN authority, NATO nations undertook an air campaign
with a stated humanitarian aim.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	There are other straws in the wind. The
establishment of the International Criminal Court is one. Here we see
a strong European view that international security is enhanced by
bringing despots to justice. The US takes a different view, worrying
about the implications for its own citizens if they were called to
account. The indictment of General Pinochet was another indication
that European nations were not prepared to let past human rights
abuses go unpunsihed. The steady arrest of people for war crimes in
Bosnia is a third.I would argue that this is the start of a new
dimension to international relations which will have implications for
global security. It is of course possible to argue that none of this
is new. Indeed the protection of human rights is fundamental to the
United Nations. That may be true in treaty language, but the reality
has been far short of it over the years.  The first change for the
new millennium may then be a much greater emphasis on human and
individual rights by the major democratic powers. If this is so, then
there are some fairly major implications for how we deal with a
number of places around the world- not least China, but I shall
return to this in a moment. For security is not just about military
and diplomatic activity. Many of the world's problems stem from other
factors, and in particular from economic issues.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Economics &amp; Security</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	We seem for the moment to have survived
the Asian markets crisis with confidence on the mend. Yet economic
issues shape our security thinking. The moves we are making in Europe
towards an integrated economic structure are inevitably leading to
debate on the next stage of foreign policy and security integration.
Our economic competition with the US, and of course the Asian
competition with the US, will have implications for the military
support that we can both (Europe and Asia) expect in the future from
America. The economy of Russia is a security issue for us in Europe .
Most of all the economic success of the US is a key to the sort of
world we can expect. There is no reason to assume that the US has
managed to break out of the cycles of growth and depression, however
much the investment analysts might want to believe it. The internet
stocks of today may be the tulips or south sea investment
opportunities of yesterday.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Global markets give a global
interdependence. Again economists are still arguing whether this
gives the global economy a new robustness or a new vulnerability. The
rapid recovery of the Asian markets is seen as a sign of the benefits
of global markets - but there are those that would argue that the
current recovery has slowed the market reforms that were needed in
Asia in general, and Japan in particular, thus setting the world up
for a deeper depression when the next fall comes. What no one
disputes is the importance of Asian economies to the  rest of the
world's markets. Financial crashes, corruption and crime can give
rise quite rapidly to instability. Albania was destablised by pyramid
selling schemes which required a European intervention force. Russia
seems to be drifting deeper into financial chaos, which may lead to
political chaos. Riots in Indonesia, anti-democratic moves in
Malaysia, tensions in Korea, all stemmed from the financial meltdown
in the region three years ago. So economic stability is important for
global security, and both are affected by another major world issue -
that of population.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Population Growth</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	India passed the one billion people mark
sometime in August 1999. Together with China, it represents a third
of the world's population. Growth rates are declining everywhere, yet
for the developing world they remain positive. The world's population
looks set to stabilise and even start to decline by the end of the
next century, but in the meantime there will have been some
significant demographic changes. India will probably become the most
populous country around 2030. The European countries may be having a
different sort of population crisis if they continue to have negative
growth rates. The divide between rich and poor states may be
magnified by these differential population growth rates. All of these
strains, with their security implications may be further exacerbated
by environmental problems. Economic refugees as well as political
refugees are already a security issue for many countries. I was
interested to hear from a senior Swiss diplomat that Switzerland was
having to think about its lofty neutrality after Kosovo. The massive
influx of refugees into the country, showed that Switzerland had a
direct security interest in the future of the Balkans.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">A particular worry for Europe is the growing
population in North Africa. The distances across the Mediterranean
are small, but the imbalance in wealth and demographics is great. If
Europe has an aging population, and North Africa a growing youth
population, it would seem that there must be opportunity for
co-operation. On the security side , you see NATO engaging in the
Mediterrannean dialogue, and on the economic side the EU trying to
establish closer relationships.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Environment, Resources &amp; Energy</FONT>
</H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Environmental issues are becoming a
growing part of the wider definition of security. Global warming may
affect available land in places like Bangladesh, or cause unexpected
disasters in Mozambique. It may affect food availability in
developing countries more adversely.  Pollution of air or water can
become a threat to neighbours. Availability of fresh water is another
growing cause of friction between states. The forest fires of
Indonesia hardly help relations with its neighbours, but may also
have wider implications for the atmosphere - as is of course also the
case with the Brazilian rain forests. We have seen that industrial
fishing can take fish stocks below the level of viability. The
Labrador fisheries are now dead. Again this can be a source for
conflict. Resentment still occurs between member states of the EU on
fishing quotas, but they are at least now settled by negotiation
rather than war. The intensity of commercial operations, the need for
fresh water, the growing populations and the need to raise living
standards are problems which come together across much of  the poorer
parts of the world, and in which Europe feels it has an
interest..</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	It will not be possible for the rich
nations to hold back the aspirations of the poor nations. Yet the
consequences in terms of just energy requirements are of great
concern. We shall need to look at ways of providing the necessary
energy without the burning of carbon - and that probably means a
renaissance of nuclear energy, which brings with another series of
potential problems, not least in terms of the availability of the
necessary materials for nuclear weapons.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Disease - Natural and Man-made</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Europe also worries about the security
implications of disease. We may have passed through a relatively
golden age this century in terms of the tools to fight disease. Aids
and TB are taking their toll. Malaria areas will increase with global
warming. This would be reason for concern enough, but to it we must
add the growing perception of  biological weapons as the poor man's
nuclear bomb. Even in the old fashioned anthrax aerosol, this
prospect is a serious concern. If you add the prospect of genetic
modification to the design of biological warfare, you have a very
bleak prospect for the future.It would however be fair to say, it is
one which  Europe would prefer to deal with through arms control
measures rather than military expenditure. A rigorous CWC and BWC
regime is the European way, but not perhaps attractive to the US
</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Weapons of Mass Destruction</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	We rightly feel much less at risk from
nuclear weapons today than we did through the Cold War period. It is
certainly true that there are far fewer nuclear warheads now than
there were in the 1980s. But there are still an enormous number held
by the US and Russia. Russia is a particular problem with a decaying
military infrastructure, it is by no means clear that control of the
tactical nuclear weapon arsenal can be maintained.	</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"> 	India and Pakistan have been nuclear
weapon states for a long time, but neither had previously felt it
necessary to declare themselves as such. The optimist would argue
that they have improved deterrence by their tests; the pessimists
would say that they are their systems are not well controlled and a
nuclear war has become more likely. North Korea has been working hard
to achieve a nuclear capability. It has almost certainly a biological
and chemical capability, and the targets in South Korea are not
difficult to reach. Of great concern has been its recent involvement
of Japan by testing its new missiles in that direction. Japan must be
feeling increasingly beleaguered both with this and internal threats.
The cult, who used sarin gas in the Tokyo underground, had also tried
to get samples of the ebola virus for biological attacks. Japan will
also worry about the China - Taiwan situation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The US has taken the lead in NATO on
pro-active strategies for countering WMD. European states are less
enthusiastic about such policies. The current impetus within the US
to move forward into National Missile Defence poses a particular
problem for European partners, and may become a very divisive issue.
The European view is that NMD cannot provide invulnerability to
attack, even for the US, but certainly not for Europe. It will be
very expensive and destabilising. They regret the potential
renegotiation or abrogation of the ABM treaty and its likely effect
on START 3. By the way, they are less than happy about the US refusal
to ratify the CTBT or the landmines treaty. They see the world as
becoming a less secure place as countries take measures to rebalance
their capabilities in the light of the US decisions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">China as a Major Power</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	It appears that China is having a
considerable internal debate over how to handle Taiwan. If it were to
attack, it would place not just the United States but also Europe in
a very interesting position. The states that came together to throw
Iraq out of Kuwait are also largely the same states that went to war
in Kosovo for human rights. Taiwan is a vibrant democratic place with
a great deal of commercial activity in America and Europe. China
continues to fall far short of the norms of human rights that the
world community now expects. It is difficult to see how the states
who fought for the Kosovar Albanians could stand by and watch the
military conquest of Taiwan. The consequences of such a confrontation
are incalculable.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Indeed in any look to the future the
developments in China are key. The West often seems to work on the
principle of hope rather than realism. We are in a difficult period
at the moment where the US is becoming more cautious in its
relationships with China, and China is flexing its muscles. The
parades  to celebrate 50 years of the Peoples' Republic of China were
very reminiscent of the shows of military prowess much favoured by
the Soviet Union in the Cold War. The announcement that China is
increasing defence spending by 12.7% is also indicative. Whether,
this can be made even more difficult by a warming of Sino-Russian
relationships is questionable, and we see the first joint military
exercises  taking place. We should not forget that whatever their
economic situation both remain nuclear powers, and are watching
developments in NMD very carefully.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">The decline in the power of States</FONT>
</H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">So is the future to be all fear and no hope?
For addressing most of these global security problems, individual
States are no longer able to act alone. Even the United States is
constrained in what it can do by itself,  and for a number of issues
as I have explained  the US is seen in Europe as a major part of the
problem. The United Nations is a wonderful ideal, but is much
hampered in practice. Work is needed to make it better able to meet
its obligations. Regional groupings should be effective in dealing
with local troubles. Of these groupings, the EU is the most mature,
but lacks a coherent foreign and security policy. If it were to
develop one, and the diplomatic and military tools to underpin such a
policy, it could be a very powerful agent for stability. In its
absence, NATO has taken on the role, but has a problem of legitimacy
for authorising interventions, and as we saw in Kosovo loses some of
its efficiency operating as a consensus organisation of 19
states.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"> The contributions from the European  NATO
nations which took part in that operation were varied, but all were
overshadowed by the US. For example, the UK carried out only 4.3% of
the total sorties flown. The story is similar for the other non-US
NATO air forces. Europe was shown to be good at providing political
support for the operation, but incompetent at contributing to the air
campaign in a significant way. The difficulties in raising ground
force numbers, even for an operation in a relatively  benign
environment, suggested that the armies of  Europe were as badly
structured as those of the air forces. On the naval side, the last
ten years has shown that, with the exception of US major aircraft
carriers and cruise missile platforms, there is also a limited need
for Cold War maritime military assets. </FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Europe as a Strategic Power		</FONT>
</H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Does any of this matter? It is sometimes
argued that there is no need to change the current arrangements for
security within Europe. NATO served the continent well throughout the
Cold War, and has reinvented itself to adapt to the security needs of
the post Cold War era. Indeed the enlargement of NATO, the new
strategic concept and the recognition of the needs of a European
Defence and Security Identity within NATO are all a part of a new
security structure for Europe. The question is whether this process
of development within the NATO structure is sufficient for the
future. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Europe is an economic power, but it is a
long way from being a strategic power. To be a strategic power
requires two key elements: a clear and coherent foreign policy, and
the diplomatic and military means to implement that foreign policy.
Europe currently has neither. For the 21st Century, it seems
inconceivable that a region which is as rich and populous as the
United States can expect to continue its foreign and security policy
on either an exclusively  national basis or only through NATO. As we
have seen from Bosnia and Kosovo, Europe must shape its security
strategy  always mindful of how it will play in the US Congress.
Looking to the longer term, NATO remains important (and more secure
after Kosovo), but there is no guarantee that it will remain in
existence for ever. Had the Kosovo operation ended in failure, the
future utility of NATO would have been very much in doubt. There will
doubtless be other tests of Alliance cohesion in the years
ahead.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">We have therefore seen at last a serious
move in Europe to do better in providing defence capability. In
December, in Helsinki, the heads of the 15 countries agreed on a path
to develop both a mechanism for the devlopment of European foreign
and security policy, and for a more useable military capability. This
is designed to strengthen the European contribution to NATO, but also
to provide an autonomous European capability by 2003.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Hopes or Fears</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">As I said when I began, security specialists
look at the black side in order to give advice on how to prevent the
worst case coming to pass.  Despite the best efforts of the
international community to promote multicultural liberal democracies,
we seem to be developing a move towards rights for ethnic, religious
or cultural self determination, whether in the former Yugoslavia or
in East Timor. If this proves to be the case, there will be a long
queue of disputes, with the Kurds near the top. Africa is still riven
by civil warfare and ethnic cleansing of the worst kind, and suffers
from most of the other troubles that I touched on: poor economy, high
population growth rates, disease, famine and corruption.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">There are nevertheless many hopeful signs as
we enter the new century. The Cold War has ended. Economies are
vibrant. Technology is allowing individuals access to more
information than ever before, and the ability to operate on a global
basis. International Law is beginning to bring pressure to bear on
abusers of human rights. Population growth is declining.
Environmental issues are recognised. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">There  are great reasons to be optimistic
for the prospects of greater peace and prosperity in the 21st
Century, but only if people and their governments face up to their
global responsibilities. The dangers are real and many if nations are
fixed only on their own self interest. In Europe, we at last seem to
be starting to face up to our responsibilities as a region which is
both wealthier and more populous than the United States.</FONT></P>
