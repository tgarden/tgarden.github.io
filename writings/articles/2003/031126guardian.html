			<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Everyone has views on military strategy these days. As the Iraq invasion began, we all agreed that no plan survives contact with the enemy. This generalisation proved less than accurate. The fighting phase from 20 March until 1 May was completed without any serious setback to the American, British and Australian invading forces. What has been less impressive is the absence of any serious planning options for what to do after the battle was won. Now the universal cry is for an exit strategy.<br>
					<br>
					The strategic aim is clear. The US wants an Iraq that is governed by a friendly government, and one that can act as a stabilising force on potentially difficult neighbours. From such an arrangement they expect benefits for their war on terror, security of oil supplies, forward basing for other military operations, constraints on proliferation, and also improved security for Israel. While the rest of the world had mixed views on the wisdom of the Iraq intervention, most would now sign up to the importance of making post-Saddam Iraq a successful independent stable country, if not necessarily to the American master plan.<br>
					<br>
					Looking at post Cold War interventions, we have not had that much successful experience in building nations from scratch. In Afghanistan, the approach suggests a useful template. When the major fighting stopped, and the Taliban government had fled, a system and timetable for interim government, constitutional development and eventual elections were agreed with international help. The interim leadership had legitimacy and Hamad Karzai provided a charismatic focus. The process has largely been seen as equitable and participation in the development of a new constitution has been broadly representative. Where Afghanistan has failed has been in the lack of security arrangements beyond Kabul. As a result, warlords have reasserted their power, and they will make the implementation of an agreed constitution far more difficult, and perhaps ultimately less than democratic.<br>
					<br>
					In Iraq, the scale of security forces has been significantly greater than in Afghanistan. While the situation is not yet satisfactory, local despots cannot yet reign in their areas unhindered. What is lacking is the sense of direction towards a new democratic  Iraq. The Iraqi  Governing Council is widely seen as an ineffectual creature of the United States. While prudence means that the US has tried to include representatives of significant factions, they lack universal legitimacy. Now the US is set to hand power over to this Council next July without fussing about a constitution or an election first.<br>
					<br>
					A theoretical task list is not difficult to assemble. The over-riding strategic aim must be to return control of Iraq to an Iraqi government which has both internal and international legitimacy. To achieve this aim, a number of enabling requirements will have to be met.  Providing adequate security on the ground is important, but not an end in itself. We can regret the blunders of allowing looting in the early days, of changing the coalition leadership, of disbanding the Iraqi army, of inadequate intelligence resources, and of reversals of political timetables. Nevertheless, the insurgency is not so out of control that it needs to delay the key political process. The problem is  the trendline in violence. Attacks on US forces, international organisations and Iraqi leadership figures are rising. Unless this is reversed, the maintenance of law and order will displace the building of the new Iraq constitution and government as a priority. The new accelerated timetable favoured by the US suggests that time is now running out.<br>
					<br>
					How can the Coalition Provisional Authority hold the security situation? Large increases in troops from outside the country are not available. The US has shown how surprisingly ill equipped it is to sustain even 120,000 troops for more than a year. A transfer from the curious coalition to a NATO-led force would have advantages, but is impractical given shortage of time and NATO&#146;s increasing task in Afghanistan. Clearly transfer of security tasks to Iraqis is the way ahead, and the belated training up of both police and army personnel is a good move. The US will find it uncomfortable to give greater  responsibility to its new Iraqi army. There will also be dangers that the new Iraqi security force could become part of a power struggle, if it is not trained and structured to answer to an elected government. As one regional specialist said to me last year: if you want to keep Iraq together, you will need to find a new Saddam Hussein to run it. <br>
					<br>
					The real danger of either allowing Iraq to fail and break up, or  handing control over to an unrepresentative leadership, makes moving forward the political process the most urgent task. There is no longer time to do much about the way the Council has been created. It needs to share responsibility for day to day management, but it must have a  limited time in power. A date for government elections would give the essential spur to the constitutional process. That date might be 12 months from a UN Security Council resolution which spelled out the constitutional process. In practical terms, we should aim for free elections by Spring 2005.<br>
					<br>
					There would be a lot of work to do in the meantime. The development of a constitution must not be the servant either of US desires or of the unelected Governing Council. The potentially vast sums of money in international aid need to be managed transparently and without favour. The oil revenues will also need clear interim international management. Even with such major moves to internationalise the future of Iraq, the security situation would remain challenging. Both the USA and the UK bear a heavy responsibility for the situation, and will have to be prepared to produce the necessary police and army forces to hold the line. Premature announcements of future force reductions do not help. There will be few thanks, but we made the situation, and we had better be prepared to pay the price to sort it out. Once an elected Iraqi democratic government is in place, it will be for them to decide whether they need continuing military presence from outsiders.</font></p>
