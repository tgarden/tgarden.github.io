			<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Sorting out democratic institutions is a difficult business. European leaders argue about an EU constitution. Also this weekend in Afghanistan, the loya jirga will be finishing their new constituion. Unfortunately, its success of will depend on improving the anarchic security situation. Iraq is just setting out on this great adventure in democracy. The security situation in parts of the country remains bad. Plans have had to change radically. Can Iraq make the transformation to a viable democratic state?<br>
					<br>
					Ambassador Paul Bremer, the head of the Coalition Provisional Authority has accelerated the transfer of power to Iraqis. Reacting to a fatwah issued by the Shia leader, Ayatollah Sistani, he decided that the  CPA would have to hand over power to Iraqis before a constitution had been agreed. He signed an agreement on the political process with Iraqi Governing Council on 15 November. It requires a &quot;fundamental law&quot; &#150; in effect an interim constitution to kick start the political process &#150; to be agreed by the end of February next year. The fundamental law will lay down the provisions for human rights, the federal structure for Iraq and how the Iraqi armed forces are to be controlled by the civilian authorities. At the same time the Iraqis will make an agreement with the multinational forces over the how they are to continue in Iraq. <br>
					<br>
					Through March and April, a national committee of selected Iraqis will organise groups within each of the 18 governorates. These caucuses will then choose members of a Transitional National Assembly by the end of May. The Assembly elects an executive and appoints ministers, so that there is an Iraqi interim government in place by 30 June 2004. At this point the Coalition Provisional Authority is due to come to an end. Despite the apparent complexity of the system, at no stage does it involve the people of Iraq in choosing their government on the basis of elections. The agreement on the timetable for the political process now voting off until the following year. The members of a full constitutional convention are due to be elected by the Iraqi people by mid March 2005. The  constitution will be put to a referendum of the people. Finally a general election on the basis of the approved constitution is supposed to take place before the end of 2005. Speaking at the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London on Friday, the senior British representative in Iraq, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, admitted that this timetable could slip into 2006.<br>
					<br>
					This plan has a number of difficulties ahead. At the moment, the Americans remain in control. The Iraqi Governing Council exists only because the US allows it. While there is pressure on President Bush, in an election year, to reduce the number of his troops at risk in Iraq, there is no doubt that he wants to turn the country into a friendly helpful centre for influence throughout the region. He will be wary of developments which might lead ultimately to another Islamic republic like Iran. This may mean that the Shia majority will feel themselves under-represented as the process unfolds. In a recent poll, 70% of Iraqis said they trusted religious organisations, while only 22% trusted political parties. The Kurds in the north of Iraq have enjoyed a fair degree of autonomy over the past decade, and they will be unhappy to find themselves as a minority element in a Baghdad run government. However if they are given too much self government, neighbouring Turkey will start feeling security concerns over moves towards an independent Kurdistan. <br>
					<br>
					The third group of players is that of the Sunnis. They ruled the country under Saddam Hussein using cruel repression against both Shia and Kurd. Trying to engage them in the political process is a challenge.  This has not been helped by the Iraqi Governing Council setting up  its own war crimes tribunal. The tribunal will investigate the events of the past 35 years, has no international legitimacy, and could use the death penalty. It is unlikely that such a scheme will assist good governance and the political process. <br>
					<br>
					But even if the fears of all the different factions can be coped with, there remains the security situation and its implications for both politics and the economic future of the country. It is clear that violence will continue regardless of defensive tactics. The guerrilla style war may be confined largely to former Saddam loyalist areas, but it has an adverse effect on development throughout the country. The deaths to Iraqis both from insurgents and from coalition operations goes largely unreported in the international media. However, it makes it difficult for the average Iraqi caught in the crossfire to be sure whether democracy will eventually prevail. Handing over the security tasks to Iraqis is an urgent requirement. It was a major error that Bremer chose to disband the Iraqi Army, and he is now having to build a new one. However, if political developments bog down, Iraqi security forces may themselves may seek to be players in the future of the country.<br>
					<br>
					Iraq is an extraordinary experiment. No one can know whether this attempt to build a democracy will work. Consistency of policy is now needed. If Britain has any influence with the Bush Administration, we need to use it to internationalise the political process in Iraq. Jeremy Greenstock believes that 2005 will be the crunch year when the Iraqis have to deliver on their democratic undertakings. His is inevitably the optimistic scenario. If reprisals and violence increases, if the Aytollahs are unco-operative and if the Transitional Authority fails to meet the timetable, a very different outcome is possible. A strong pro-American Iraqi leadership, supported by a loyal military force, is one possibility. After all it worked for the West in the 1980's when we supported Saddam Hussein as a leader we could do business with. A break up like the Balkans is another possibility. Or a prolonged guerrilla war with no real government may turn Iraq into a base for terrorists in the region and beyond. There is a lot riding on making Iraq work.</font></p>
