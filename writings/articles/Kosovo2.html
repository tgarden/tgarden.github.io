<H2><CENTER>Can NATO Air Power do the trick?</CENTER></H2>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><CENTER>Air Marshal Sir Timothy Garden - 27 March 1999
</CENTER></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>At a defence specialists meeting in Germany last weekend, we
talked of nothing but the coming crisis in Kosovo. At the same
conference two years before, we had agreed that the Kosovo problem
needed urgently sorting out. Yet last Sunday, the television news
bulletins were given over to Morecambe and Wise, and the public
seemed unaware of the impending major conflict in Europe. Senior
military, diplomatic and political figures were agonising over how
the certain humanitarian crisis could be avoided. It was clear that
President Milosevic would continue his policy of ethnic cleansing -
replacing those of Albanian origin with his own Serbian people -
unless armed international peace keepers were in place in Kosovo. The
unarmed monitors had been withdrawn: they could not prevent the Serbs
from committing atrocities. NATO had threatened to use force to back
the diplomatic process at key stages over the past year, and each
time an uneasy diplomatic settlement had been achieved, only to be
subsequently broken by Milosevic. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke tried
one last time to broker a deal early last week, but after two
fruitless meetings returned to Brussels empty-handed and the 19 NATO
nations agreed that Operation Allied Force was on.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>On Wednesday evening, NATO launched a massive coordinated air
attack on Yugoslavia. Cruise missiles from American B52 bombers and
warships, and for the first time from a Royal Navy submarine, struck
key air defence installations in Serbia, Kosovo and Montenegro.
Almost immediately precision guided bombs from the jets of 13 NATO
air forces were raining down on army, air force and police targets.
Tony Blair had made the military aim quite clear in his speech to a
sombre House of Commons. Air strikes were "to curb continued Serbian
repression in Kosovo in order to avert a humanitarian disaster".
Subsequent briefings by George Robertson, the Defence Secretary, and
NATO leaders have explained how air power will achieve this. A
lengthy air campaign is planned which will at first concentrate on
destroying the Yugoslav integrated air defence system. This will mean
that airfields, radars, headquarters, missile sites and ammunition
stores will be high up the target list. The horrors in Kosovo are
enacted by both army and police units. Their headquarters, fuel
dumps, tank parks, barracks, training areas, communications systems
and logistics areas will feature increasingly in later phases.
General Sir Charles Guthrie, the British Chief of Defence Staff says
that he, and his fellow NATO military chiefs, "are in no doubt that
that what we have been asked to do can be done". A distinguished
professional soldier is content that the airmen can deliver the
campaign.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Yet, there are many questions left hanging. There is no doubt that
without the air strikes, the killing in Kosovo, the shelling of
villages and the growing Albanian exodus would have worsened. Some
might argue that action was necessary to preserve NATO credibility; I
cannot agree. Action was necessary to avert the inevitable
humanitarian disaster in our backyard. While the action is essential,
it is a step into the dark. We are asking air power to achieve a very
precise and difficult aim. In the end, the deep felt animosity
between Albanian and Serbian ethnic groups means that an armed
peacekeeping force will be necessary for years to come. We have
proved that in Bosnia. There are only two ways that we will get such
a force in place: either Milosevic returns to the negotiating table
or NATO ground forces fight their way in. In any planning this must
remain the bottom line. At the moment all NATO politicians are making
it clear that a land war is not an option.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>We are left with a strategy that requires unending bombing until
Milosevic volunteers to allow NATO forces to come and police Kosovo.
Will it work? We cannot know, but like any prudent military planner,
we need to have contingency plans for every possibility. There are
many obvious risks. War is always unpredictable. The Serbs might
decide to go on the offensive, with attacks on the NATO troops in
Macedonia, or in Bosnia, Albania or even against the airbases in
Italy. NATO will have taken every precaution, and has far superior
forces, but could still find its ground forces fighting to defend
themselves. The Russians, against all their best interests, might
offer tangible support to the Serbs, which would change the European
security picture for years to come. These, and other risks, will keep
the planners busy to ensure that the benefits of action continue to
outweigh the consequences of inaction. Holding together the 19 NATO
nations for a prolonged campaign will take great diplomatic effort.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>If all goes well on the military and political side, will the
nightly devastation make life better for the ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo? It is as yet too early to say. The long list of targets will
take time to complete. Some missions will be postponed because of the
weather, others will bring their bombs back to ensure that the risk
of civilian casualties is minimised. The pace of operations may be
tempered in the light of Milosevic's actions. If he keeps up the
ethnic cleansing, the firepower will increase; if he seems to be
reducing his forces in Kosovo, longer pauses for diplomatic effort
may result. Even when the bombs are dropping, the diplomatic process
must continue. And if, in perhaps two months' time, a devastated
Serbian military is still killing Albanians in Kosovo, what then?
NATO may be trying to destroy every last tank, aircraft, field gun
and headquarters, but as we have seen in Rwanda, a machete is enough
for genocide. Prudent planning would include a contingency plan for
this worst case. It would mean building a consensus for the use of
ground troops to impose a settlement. NATO had previously planned to
field some 28,000 troops to implement any agreement; they should be
planning how to raise as many again in the first instance. Air power
may add a new battle honour to its history, but only time will tell.
