<P>When Jenny Shaw at Brasseys asked whether I would consider
updating my book The Technology Trap, my first action was to re-read
that slim volume that I had started writing in the early 1980s. Then
I had been concerned, as a military man, that we seemed to be stuck
in an endless loop of seeking expensive technological solutions to
our security concerns. The rising costs of these specialist defence
technologies were depleting our capability for fighting in the near
term, and it was by no means certain that they would even deliver
what they promised in the longer term. To rectify these shortcomings
we would spend yet more of our declining budget looking for new
panacea weapons.</P>

<P>The book was written in a security context of the Cold War. The
idiocy of the technology enthusiasts had reached a peak with the
ill-fated Strategic Defence Initiative, which had been set in train
by President Ronald Reagan in 1983. It was evident to many of us that
the development of a nuclear defence umbrella was flawed technically,
economically and strategically. Yet billions of defence dollars
flowed down the industrial and research plug hole to remarkably
little effect. The hope of public and politicians that some magic
invulnerability could be provided by the defence scientist is perhaps
to be forgiven; the over-optimistic predictions of soldier,
researcher and the defence industry is a little less endearing.</P>

<P>My aim in The Technology Trap was to examine where science had
been able to make a key contribution in the past. The book then
examined eight key research disciplines, which looked at that time to
have potential military application. By isolating the most important
potential advances, and also looking at civil applications, I was
able to identify where it seemed most profitable to invest limited
defence resources.</P>

<P>What has changed since I wrote the analysis? First, the security
context is now quite different. The threat of total war at very short
notice has ceased to be a preoccupation for the NATO nations.
Military operations are numerous, but forces are significantly
smaller, and defence budgets have declined dramatically. Secondly,
science has not stood still. I was pleased that the areas which I had
identified seven years ago as interesting had progressed, and in many
cases exceeded my expectations, in the general directions that I had
forecast. New ideas have emerged in many of these disciplines, and
for the main part I have kept to the same subdivisions that I used
before. Only in two areas do I feel the need to introduce separate
chapters in this edition: mathematics and nanotechnology.</P>

<P>As last time, the book concludes by looking at how the new
technologies could be used in military operations in the future. The
analysis is entirely new, as the operations now required of the
military are new, the alliances are different and the resources
available are likely to be less than any of us imagined in the days
of the Cold War.</P>

<P>My aim remains as before: to educate the decision-makers in the
realities of what technology can offer. Whatever the level of defence
spending, those inside the planning, budgetary and procurement
process must make judgements to produce the most effective armed
forces. It was not an easy process even when the threat appeared to
be readily definable. The various vested interests of each Service,
of the politicians, of the research scientists and of industry all
serve to distort the logic of the process. The time scales for weapon
system procurement remain measured in decades, while some
technologies offer double the capability every two years.</P>

<P>I am more experienced in the limitations of the planning process
than perhaps I was when I wrote the first edition. I spent some time
involved in planning the future UK Defence Programme. Despite my own
inclination to avoid high cost, high risk projects, I was rarely
successful in stopping even the most obvious money wasters once they
were in progress. Defence departments as institutions have the
mentality of the roulette player who believes he can win by
doubling-up. Nevertheless, as each new generation of decision-makers
arrives, they need to remember that their new pet project may be 15
years from delivery, will almost certainly do much less than they
expect, and will cost much more. That is the nature of the technology
trap.</P>
