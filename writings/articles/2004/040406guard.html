			<h4>In the Firing Line</h4>
			<h4><b>by Tim Garden</b></h4>
			<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
			<p>As the American, British and Polish military commanders meet to review the current security situation in their sectors of Iraq, they will have a sense of growing unease. Some of their troops are weary of the task of trying to bring peace. To the average soldier, it seems the height of ingratitude daily to face the guns and bombs of Iraqis. After all, have they not freed this oppressed people from the rule of Saddam Hussein? Yet those with more experience will have seen how quickly peacemakers become targets in other theatres. Politicians and publics expect armed forces to be able to solve the security problem in any trouble spot. Yet whether it is Northern Ireland, Bosnia, Kosovo, Macedonia, East Timor, Afghanistan or Iraq, armies can do no more than attempt to hold the ring until there is an accepted political settlement.</p>
			<p>Iraq poses particular problems for the Coalition forces. Many mistakes were made in the first days after combat operations. Few seem clear on the process by which this administration will gain legitimacy either internally or internationally. Against this backdrop, professional soldiers have to try to keep the peace and promote the rule of law.</p>
			<p>Military operations need good intelligence.&nbsp; We now know how poor the strategic intelligence was in the run up to the invasion last year. There has not been much improvement since. Attacks from residual Saddam loyalists have been more sustained and effective than predicted. While many of the key pre-war leadership figures have been captured, using bribes for information, the Sunni triangle remains a hazardous place for all foreigners. Islamic extremists seem also to have decided that Iraq is the new Afghanistan. They seek to continue their fight against western imperialism by taking on a variety of targets in Iraq. A third major threat is now emerging from elements of the younger Shia population. Their elders may also be moving towards demonstrating resistance.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Political decisions, such as the banning of their newspaper Al Hawsa, have generated fierce militancy among the supporters of Sayid Muqtada Sadr. As sections of the community begin to think that force rather than democracy is what will count, things are set to get worse. This places the allied forces in a difficult position. They must help the ordinary Iraqis to feel safe. The need to win hearts and minds. At the same time, the multiple threats mean they must both protect themselves, and also take on the attackers.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Winning hearts and minds from behind the safe walls of Saddam's palaces, or in an armoured vehicle is impossible. Yet given the level of risk, we may be now moving to a turning point in the conduct of operations. If the insurgency provokes the Coalition forces to go on to a war footing, then the steady progress to a peaceful democracy in Iraq will be halted. Without a clear agreed political process, army commanders will argue for priority to go to the safety of their own troops.</p>
			<p>The signs are already clear that the American forces are ready to go on the offensive. Apache helicopter gunships have been firing at Shia targets in Baghdad. Exchanges of heavy fire continue in Sunni Falluja. Gunmen occupy the governor's office in Basrah. The casualties mount in Najaf. Yet each show of strength by occupying forces increase resentment, and generates new recruits to the insurgents' cause. As the Israelis have seen, such tactics do little to improve security.</p>
			<p>As with so much of recent history of Iraq, it is easy to say how it could have been done better.&nbsp; More effort needs to go into training local police forces. The infrastructure needs to be both repaired and protected. Intelligence must be improved. A wider alliance must be engaged through the UN. Commanders must use minimum force. With each twist of the spiral, it becomes more difficult to be optimistic for the future. The military will do their best to keep a window open for the diplomats, but time is now short. Even the US superpower is finding it difficult to sustain the number of soldiers needed on the ground. Yet, any withdrawal in the middle of the year would ensure that the current guerilla actions turn into civil war.</p>
