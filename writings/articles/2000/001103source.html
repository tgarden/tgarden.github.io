<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Bruce George, Chairman of the Defence Select
Committee, has produced a well researched report on the Kosovo
campaign. The MOD has a natural Whitehall reluctance to wash too much
of its dirty linen in public, as we have been reminded in a revealing
letter by a retired officer in The Times of 30 October. Trying to
assess Whitehall decisions depends more and more on the publications
from the Defence Committee, and also from the National Audit Office,
as MOD White Papers become thinner, glossier and less informative.
The relatively late date of publication has allowed the Committee to
draw on the many  reports that have been published abroad.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"> It must have been one of the more difficult
exercises for the Committee to scope. The nature of this unique
undertaking by NATO meant that the inter-relationship between the
politics of the 16 (which became 19 during the air campaign) NATO
nations were as important as the individual contributions of
capabilities which they made.  The self imposed aim of the report is
to help  politicians in any future such operation understand the
risks and constraints imposed, and to minimise them. This worthy aim
is hardly likely to be achievable. Those politicians, who were
involved,  are doubtless only too well aware of the problems. From
the UK MOD point of view, the usual problems of mobile Ministers mean
that only one (John Spellar) with the Kosovo campaign experience
still remains. It will be too much to hope doubt that the Cabinet 
will prepare themselves for the next humanitarian intervention with
this report.  The publication is much more useful for providing real
operational evidence of why forces need to be ready for operations at
all times. Deferred capabilities and fixed scenarios may seem the
best way of squaring the resource/commitment circle in peacetime, but
such an approach can come back and bite you in war.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Committee decided not to address the
question of legitimacy of the operation. It may be that they were
unable to achieve an internal consensus on this aspect. They explore
the difficulties of maintaining NATO alliance cohesion, but are
highly critical of the strategy which discounted the possibility of a
ground campaign from the start. In the Sunday Times  of 29 October,
Air Marshal Sir John Day is quoted as saying that a ground invasion
was only a few hours away when Milosevic finally capitulated. This
does not answer the criticism of the Committee that the threat should
have been made much earlier. Even though the Government will claim
that they had to publicly discount the ground option to keep allies
(particularly the United States, Germany and Greece) aboard, there
were other more subtle approaches that could have been adopted. To
have said nothing about the possibility of a ground campaign would
have been one. The leaking of call up of key reservists would be
another. Moving forces forward in an apparent preparation for a
ground entry would be a third. These would all be a part of a Psy Ops
strategy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Space will not allow a full analysis here of
all the important issues which the report raises. It has not been
well received by the MOD. Many of the equipment problems have already
been highlighted by the NAO. New questions which are raised included
the balance of investment between air defence and offensive counter
air systems. Only 6 Serbian fighters were destroyed in the air, while
over 100 were destroyed on the ground. Is the lesson that we should
be investing more on bombing capability rather than on fighter
equipment? Certainly the more general lack of precision all weather
bombing capability is a cause for concern.The Committee also
expresses concern over the fact that the majority of UK weapons
dropped were cluster bombs, and it looks as though some members may
have wanted to say something stronger about their dubious legality. 
They also highlight the European lack of capability in weapon systems
for the suppression of enemy air defences, and believe that this is
an urgent area for European co-operation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The UK used two unmanned systems: the
Tomahawk cruise missiles and the Phoenix reconnaissance drones. Both
were technically reasonably successful. However, the costs of each is
a factor in their utility. Only 20 cruise missiles were fired by the
UK in the whole campaign and 17 of these hit their targets. The
Phoenix, long overdue into service, suffered an attrition rate of 8%,
which at a cost of &#163;300,000 each is an expensive but very useful
asset.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">While the Committee describes the UK's
military contribution as "mixed", it does highlight the very major
contribution that the RAF made to Alliance air to air refuelling,
with some 85% of fuel transferred to non-UK aircraft. They agree that
Europe needs much more capability in this field and wonder why the UK
is going it alone on the procurement of a new national capability. It
may be that Parliament is beginning to see that there are national as
well as NATO  advantages to greater European pooled effort in
defence. A similar argument can be made about the lack of air
transport assets, which they also report on.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Finally, Air Marshal Day is quoted as
expressing regret that the Committee did not commend the bravery of
those involved in the air campaign. In fact the Report concludes
that: "UK pilots and other aircrew and support staff discharged their
mission with distinction". It is the strategy and the quality of the
equipment which is the focus for the Defence Committee criticism.
Those who worry about future operations where equipment shortcomings
will result in failure for British forces will take little comfort
from this important document.</FONT></P>
