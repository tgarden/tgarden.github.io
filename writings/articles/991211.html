<H3>Humanitarian Intervention</H3>

<P>	In the last decade we have seen a series of crises in which
military intervention has played a major part. There appears to be an
increasing willingness on the part of the developed world to use
armed force if necessary to promote human rights, prevent crimes
against humanity and for a range of international humanitarian needs.
While all forms of diplomatic, political and economic pressure
continue to be explored in any situation, the willingness of a number
of key democratic states ultimately to use force for primarily
humanitarian reasons is a recent phenomenon. The development runs in
parallel with a greater willingness to hold despots accountable for
their previous crimes against humanity, and to put in place systems
to deter future leaders from such crimes. </P>

<P>	This short paper looks only at the military aspects of such
interventions by the international community. It assumes that the
full range of diplomatic and economic levers will have been used
ahead of any option to use force. Drawing on the experience of the
last ten years, it is possible to see a consistent trend in the way
the military are employed and make some deductions about how
appropriately structured they are for such roles. The paper
highlights the limitations of the developing international approach,
and makes some recommendations for improving military capabilities in
this area.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Lessons of the 90s</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	The fall of the Berlin Wall, the unification of Germany, the
demise of the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union, all changed the
strategic landscape in Europe in little more than a 3 year period.
NATO's purpose was suddenly in question as nations scrambled to cash
in on the peace dividend. Yet in the event, the decade of the 90's
has had more diverse military action by the Western nations, under
various banners, than at any time previously. Kuwait, Iraq, Somalia,
Rwanda, Bosnia, Haiti, Albania, Kosovo and East Timor have seen
western military force deployed to less than benign environments. A
new doctrine for peace support operations has replaced the manuals on
flexible response in the military staff colleges of the Alliance.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	This series of military experiences is sufficient now to have
established a strong consensus on the new rationale for NATO, which
was articulated in the Strategic Concept launched at the NATO summit
in Washington in April 1999. The ever increasing data from real
operations, rather than deterrence postures, has also highlighted the
major shortcomings in the security capabilities available to the
Alliance for these new tasks. The Gulf War, while not a NATO
operation, was conducted by an ad hoc coalition drawn for the most
part from NATO members. It was conducted using NATO procedures with
forces drawn from NATO formations. It was a relatively clear cut case
for the international community to react to aggression, and thus an
almost ideal trial for the concept of enforcing international law.
Iraq had clearly broken international law by invading Kuwait, and the
UN could authorise military action to expel the invaders. Iraq had
few friends among its neighbours; had an oppressive regime; and was
remote to US and European publics. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	The US led coalition was able to take its time in building up
military presence in the surrounding area. The then novel doctrine of
a prolonged air campaign was tested successfully. Lack of casualties
to the allies made the 6 weeks of offensive air action acceptable to
politicians and public. The early losses of UK Tornados had caused
great concern, and it became clear to the military commanders that
safety was to take priority over short term effectiveness. The much
greater availability of precision guidance for bombs had also set a
precedent in terms of what was acceptable collateral damage in this
type of operation. The 4 days of ground war reinforced this new
vision of war: ground forces sent in only when it was safe to secure
the victory that had been won relatively bloodlessly from the air. 
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	The key lesson from the Gulf War was that the US was both
quantitatively and qualitatively in a different capability league
from all the other nations involved. As the French discovered to
their annoyance, if they could not operate to US/NATO procedures,
then they were kept out of the action. In the air, it was a war of
offensive air operations, and these had to be conducted from medium
to high altitudes. Air defence fighters had little work to do. The
European nations had invested heavily in fighters to protect
themselves from the long range Russian bombers of the Cold War. For
their offensive operations, they had depended on low flying tactics
to improve their survivability against Warsaw Pact air defence
systems, while accepting that there would be a significant attrition
rate. In a third world war that was expected to last only 5 days
before going nuclear, training and equipment were posited on
achieving rapid results.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	 Somalia reinforced the perception internationally that the US
was only prepared to remain engaged in humanitarian intervention
operations if their troops were kept safe. The predominance of air
power solutions to international crises was underlined by the
continuing air operations over both Northern and Southern Iraq.
Operation Provide Comfort had fairly successfully, through air
operations, rescued the displaced Kurds who had fled from their homes
in Northern Iraq. It was less clear that the results for the Marsh
Arabs in the South were as positive. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	The sequence of events in Bosnia reinforced the US view that
offensive air power could provide the necessary coercion to bring
recalcitrant leaders to the negotiating table. That the history of
the region up to the Dayton accord is considerably more complex is
unimportant. There is a widespread perception among American decision
makers that the threat and application of air strikes was critical to
obtaining Milosevic's agreement to the Dayton proposals. Again, in
this short air campaign, the world expected precision attacks with no
collateral damage and no losses to our own side. When an airman was
lost over hostile territory, combat search and rescue effort became
the over-riding priority. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Operation Alba, the response to the breakdown of law and order
in Albania, showed that there were crises which required a European
coalition of the willing response. In this case, it was clear that
the mechanisms for putting together such a coalition were imperfect,
and that a successful outcome was only possible because of the
relatively benign environment.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	The 1999 Kosovo air campaign brought together all the political
and military lessons that had been learned thus far in the post Cold
War operations. The US had expended a good deal of research on
improving its precision weapons. Nevertheless, the use of laser
designation remained a significant constraint if the target was
obscured by weather. The two other precision systems (GPS navigation
and TERCOM ground mapping) were available both in bombs and cruise
missiles, but were significantly more expensive and limited to fixed
targets. They required access to US national data. Nevertheless, this
mix of weaponry allowed the campaign to be planned on a requirement
for no casualties to NATO forces, and minimal collateral damage.
These constraints undoubtedly prolonged the air campaign, but given
that the required outcome was ultimately achieved, we can expect
future operations to have similar assumptions about the requirement
for very low numbers of casualties, and a dependence on high
technology </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	 The contributions from the 14 NATO nations which took part
were varied, but all were overshadowed by the US. For example, the UK
carried out 1618 of the total of 38,004 NATO sorties flown, or just
over 4%. 102 of these sorties were the Sea Harriers doing little more
than defending the small anti-submarine warfare carrier that they are
deployed on. 324 were air-to-air refuelling aircraft mainly
supporting the Tornados that operated from their bases in Germany.
The UK E3-D airborne early warning aircraft clocked up 184 sorties.
The sorties which mattered were those carrying out offensive attacks,
and here the total UK effort was in the range 4% to 10% depending on
the method of calculation (the lower figure reflects munitions and
the higher missions flown), and we know that in many of these cases
it was not possible to release weapons. From 1008 RAF bombing sorties
just 1011 weapons were released.  Of these three quarters were
non-precision weapons. The French did slightly better with 12% of the
bombing sorties, but again only dropped 1132 bombs. The story is
similar for the other non-US NATO air forces. The US provided 70% of
the total aircraft and 80% of the total weapons delivered. Europe was
shown to be good at providing political support for the operation,
but poorly equipped to contribute to an offensive air campaign in an
effective way. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Once the NATO bombing was officially suspended on 10 June 1999,
the focus moved rapidly to the NATO ground force negotiations and
entry into Kosovo. The NATO force had been forming up under the
auspices of the Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC) HQ
which is a British led NATO formation. The UK had provided the
largest numbers of troops for KFOR and was able to have 5000 in
Kosovo by 13 June. Nevertheless differences in view emerged between
the British KFOR commander, General Sir Michael Jackson, and the US
SACEUR, General Wesley Clark, both over the timing of US ground force
entry and reaction to the Russian move to Pristina airport. The
realities of the small size of UK defence forces soon became evident.
On 6 July, the UK Defence Secretary, George Robertson, announced that
a draw down of British forces would start. This was well before KFOR
had built up to its full establishment. Subsequently, Bernard
Kouchner, the UN administrator for Kosovo, has repeatedly complained
that he cannot maintain the rule of law if the international
community fails to deliver on its promise of 6000 policeman. He has
also complained of lack of financial support for the work of
administering the province, just as Carl Bildt had done in similar
circumstances in Bosnia.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	No sooner was the Kosovo air operation than a new humanitarian
crisis started building in East Timor. Although the Indonesian
government was seen as probably complicit in the ethnic cleansing by
militias in the province, they distanced themselves from what was
happening. An air campaign by the international community was not an
option under these circumstances. What was required was a UN armed
ground force to provide security and re-establish the rule of law.
This was a potentially hostile environment with armed militias
roaming the countryside, and an unpredictable Indonesian military. In
this case, Australia took the lead in providing the ground forces
with a range of nations (including Europe) providing force
contributions. The United States provided some support in the rear. 
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Future trends</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	This evolving picture of the last ten years suggests that there
is a new willingness amongst the international community to do
something about humanitarian crises and crimes against humanity. This
willingness extends to distant places and to issues which are not
directly related to the national interests of the contributing
powers. The only formal military alliance which can provide the
necessary capabilities is NATO, but operations are not necessarily
under NATO auspices. The United States as the pre-eminent military
power can provide military capabilities that are unavailable
elsewhere. However, the US appears less and less willing to put its
military personnel at risk when its direct national interests are not
threatened. It is therefore developing a doctrine which depends on
the use of precision air power from a safe distance. This is not
always appropriate or efficient for particular crises. Attempts to
provide a perfect level of protection for US ground peacekeeping
forces makes it more difficult for them to operate with the civil
communities that they are trying to help.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>The Way Forward</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Military capabilities continue to be necessary to underpin the
humanitarian aims of the international community. The essential
components are reasonably well defined: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P>a.  A capability for an air offensive
using precision weapons, including the necessary reconnaissance,
intelligence, defensive and support elements.</P>

<P>b.	A large well armed and mobile ground force with its supporting
logistics, transport and communications.</P>

<P>c.	A ground force which is able to assist the civil authorities in
law and order, rebuilding society, and refugee relief.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Operations will invariably be as coalitions of States. This raises
questions of interoperability, common doctrine and burden sharing. 
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	At present, two regions of the world bear most of the load for
intervention on behalf of the international community: North America
and Europe. They have different and unbalanced capabilities although
each spends very large amounts of money on armed forces. They promote
their interoperability and common doctrine through NATO, and
therefore NATO must remain as a key organisation. The Europeans need
to do better in terms of the provision of appropriate air power; and
the United States needs to think more about the way in which it
fields its ground forces in these circumstances. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	There is also much work to be done by all contributors on
developing an appropriate capability for the third requirement above
(assisting the civil authorities). For many operations an armed
international police force may be more appropriate than infantry.
Indeed, greater benefits would be gained by the United Nations trying
to field such a force rather than a rapid deployment military
capability.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Finally, the burden for providing such global capabilities must
be equitably shared by nations. It is important to ensure that such
operations do not come to be seen as a form of US/Europe imperialism.
This will mean helping other regions of the world to develop
appropriate capabilities to be able to support intervention in
humanitarian crises. East Timor has shown that this can be done.</P>
