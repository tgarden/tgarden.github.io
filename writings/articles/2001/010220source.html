			<h3>Keeping  military pilots</h3>
			<p><i>by Sir Timothy Garden</i></p>
		</div>
		<p>The Royal Air Force and the Fleet Air Arm are in fairly desperate straits over their primary resource. Both have acute shortages of combat pilots. The statistics published early last year by the Defence Select Committee should have rung alarm bells throughout Whitehall and Westminster. The RAF has an establishment of some 500 fast jet pilots, but was short by 95. Its head of personnel thought that, if all went well, the position might only worsen by another 40 pilots over the next 3 years. The Royal Navy reported a shortfall of 19 Sea harrier pilots out of its requirement for 65. Later in the year, the National Audit Office highlighted the long time that such pilots took to train (for RAF Tornado pilots it was taking 6 years and cost &pound;5.7 million per pilot). They also priced the  empty cockpits at some &pound;6 million each per year. Remedial action would have a long lead time and the costs would be high. </p>
		<p>The most cost effective way to rectify the problem is to retain  trained pilots for as long as possible. The training costs  and the 6 year lag between recruitment and operational service are eliminated. The money saved for each individual successfully retained is enormous. It was not surprising therefore when it was widely rumoured around the Services that pilots would be receiveing large cash retention bonuses in this year&#146;s pay review. A figure of &pound;20,000 was openly quoted by senior airmen. As a temporary retention measure, the prospect of a large cash bonus probably worked quite effectively over the last 6 months. Unfortunately, that pent up expectation may now explode into a larger than planned exodus given the nature of the deal that was announced at the same time as the Service pay review.</p>
		<p>The complicated rules allowed for payments of &pound;10,000 annual bonuses for the next two years to military pilots and navigators who had already served for 16 years and still had at least two years left to serve. No new commitment is expected from the individuals who are eligible. The amounts tapered with age and rank so that a group captain or colonel might still expect &pound;4000 despite being in his 50&#146;s. Nobody in the Army or RAF under age 37 would receive any retention bonus. The young fast jet aircrew are astonished. They find it difficult to understand why retention bonuses have been given to senior officers, who had already decided to stay on, and for the most part are not flying combat aircraft. On one flying station, it is claimed that the station commander and his 3 wing commanders will be the only individuals to benefit. It might be more appropriate to describe the scheme as one of loyalty payment rather retention bonus. To add to the sense of unfairness, a true retention bonus has been offered at the same time to Royal Navy Sea Harrier pilots. If they have done 6 years service and are prepared to commit to a further five years, they will receive &pound;50,000. </p>
		<p>The announcement to servicemen about these bonuses explains that they are holding measures while a comprehensive review is carried out. However that suggests that it will be another two years before anything emerges. For many young aircrew, this is likely to mean that the commercial airline salary with family stability will become the greater attraction. The MOD may find that it can cut back on its orders of new aircraft if it has no one to fly them.</p>
