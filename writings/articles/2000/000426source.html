<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">The NAO Report</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The Radio 4 Today programme seems to have
established a hotline to the MOD office for leaks. The latest scoop
is a draft National Audit Office (NAO) report on the Kosovo
operation. The contents of the report have not been denied by the
NAO, and the MOD has been reticent in its comments, partly due
doubtless to the Easter recess. As a result the media have had an
enjoyable few days of knocking copy. How valid has this reaction
been?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	First, the report is at a draft stage.
This will mean that the NAO has forwarded it to interested
departments for comment to make sure that they have got their facts
right. Nevertheless, it is likely to be pretty close to a final
version. Second, the draft report praises the UK contribution to the
Kosovo campaign for achieving security goals and for helping to
rebuild the shattered province. It also makes complimentary  remarks
about a number of detailed improvements in capability and
organisation. However, the media focus has inevitably been directed
at the section on weaknesses. Here the main areas of concern are
munitions, communications and medicines.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Munitions</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	On munitions, there appears to be two
different adverse comments: one on shortages and the other on
serviceability. First the claim is made that there would have been a
critical munitions shortage if the air campaign had continued for
much longer. This has been denied by the RAF in briefings. Their
actual usage of munitions was surprisingly low. A total of 1011 UK
air delivered weapons were used of which only 244 were laser guided
precision bombs. When this number is set against the total of 23,614
dropped by all NATO aircraft, it is clear that any shortage of UK
weapons would have had a negligible effect on the overall campaign.
The indications are that the RAF was operating at the limits of its
aircrew availability, and was therefore the constraint was not weapon
numbers. It may be that they would have needed to replenish stocks if
the campaign had continued, but such relatively small numbers should
have been easy to obtain. Doubtless one of the lessons learned will
be the need to consider larger stockpiles of critical munitions, but
that is different from suggesting that the success of the campaign
was at risk. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The report may also be considering the
availability of Tomahawk cruise missiles. However, the UK was never
planning to have a large stock of these weapons. They were more a
sign of political solidarity with the United States. The original
order was for fewer than 100 missiles, and at the time of Kosovo only
one of the submarines had been converted to fire them. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The report also highlights poor
serviceability of the Sea Harrier and its defensive missile systems.
This may well be the case, but will have had no effect on the Kosovo
campaign. The aircraft carrier arrived in the Aegean well after the
start of the air campaign, stayed for a month, and then left before
the end of the campaign. Its 5 Sea Harriers flew some 102 operational
sorties out of a NATO total of 38,004. The presence of the British
aircraft carrier was a useful political signal of commitment, but had
virtually no military utility.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Communications</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The NAO reports picks up the criticisms
that the army had made of its deployable communications capability.
The Source has already commented on this problem in January 2000 in
"The Limits of Defence Procurement". The ageing Clansman system has
well documented problems of both serviceability and capability, and a
replacement has been on the stocks for many years through the Bowman
programme. Old radios are unreliable and lack modern secure
encryption facilities. The army will be glad that the NAO report
supports the urgency of the requirement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	It will be interesting to see whether the
NAO's suggestion that available systems could have been procured
during the build-up in Macedonia will survive the drafting process.
Bowman remains a complex project where the technology moves much
faster than the procurement process. The introduction of a short term
buy of an off-the-shelf solution for a particular operation raises
some interesting value for money questions. Since the operation was
completed successfully, it is questionable whether the NAO, or the
Treasury, would have had much sympathy for the necessary
expenditure.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Medicines</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	There are two reported criticisms on the
medical aspects of the campaign. The first is of over-stocking of
particular medicines. Apparently 47 years worth of antibiotic
injectors were available. Again, it will be worth waiting to hear the
MOD rationale. It may be that this was a sensible precaution to
provide against the need for rapid care for epidemics among the
refugee populations - or it may just have been a cock-up. The second
criticism raised more media heat. The report says that 6000 morphine
autojets sent to the theatre in March 1999 had a shelf life until
only April 1999. Dr Moonie, the junior MOD Minister, has explained
that the new batch, which would have replaced these stocks, failed
its quality test. On the other hand the 6000 deployed autojets passed
the necessary check for a 6-month life extension. It would seem more
appropriate for the NAO to congratulate the MOD for managing a
potentially difficult supply problem rather well. This illustrates
the difficulties of reacting to draft rather than final
reports.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Lessons from Leaks</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The MOD has always tended to leak, but the
problem seems more acute now than for some time. There is no doubt
that the budget is as overstretched as the troops, and that everyone
is fighting for scarce resources or relief from the pressure for yet
more savings. The danger is that, through these leaks, the public
will gain an overstated impression of incompetence and
mismangagement, which will make politicians less sympathetic to the
call for more resources. </FONT></P>
