<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>1.	First let me say what an honour it is to have been invited to
give the Trenchard memorial lecture.  It adds a particular flavour to
the event when it takes place on the day of the 75th Anniversary of
the foundation of the Royal Air Force, and here at Cranwell, which is
itself a memorial to the forward thinking of Trenchard.  The
Commandant and I have spent the day at Marham where HM The Queen
presented a new standard to the Royal Air Force to commemorate this
75th Anniversary.  How would Trenchard have felt about the Service he
founded as he watched the flypast today?  In such a short time,
indeed in the lifetime of some, we have seen aircraft develop from
the Wright Brothers simple machine to the high technology of the F117
Stealth or in a different direction to the vast capacity of today's
airliners.  We have also seen cycles of growth and contraction in the
scale of the Royal Air Force, and tonight, I would like to review
those lessons of the past, and consider what they mean for the future
of the Royal Air Force.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>2.	The aircraft has transformed every aspect of military
operations in this century.  While there were of course earlier
instances of the use of balloons for military operations, it is only
since the development of the heavier-than-air machine, that airpower
could provide a decisive component of the military might of a nation.
 We are therefore looking at a remarkably short time span, when we
compare the strategy and tactics of our operations with land and sea
campaigns.  In 1911, the Italians used airships, balloons and
aircraft in both reconnaissance and bombing roles against the Turks
in Libya, and drew to the attention of the other great powers the
potential that such capabilities might offer in the future.  In 1912,
Major Hugh Trenchard transferred at the age of 39 to the Royal Flying
Corps - formed in May of that year, and after a course with a total
of just over one hour's flying spread over a fortnight was awarded
his wings on 31 July 1912. By the end of August he was at Upavon as
the central Flying school examiner. </P>

<P> The First World War saw the major development of fighting
capabilities in the air.  Initially both land and sea commanders
regarded observation as the primary purpose of aircraft, and radio
communications were developed to allow rapid reporting.  Fire power
soon became a requirement.  Pistols and rifles gave way to the
machine gun.  Reconnaissance aircraft now added to their tasks that
of keeping the enemy away from friendly positions.  Control of the
air became important.  As World War I progressed, or did not
progress, the advantages of attacking the enemy rear areas became
apparent, and interdiction was added to the rapidly emerging role of
air power.  From 1915 onwards, Germany carried out its strategic
bombing campaign against England using airships.  Developments in air
defence were necessary, and resulted in a German response of the
Gotha aircraft bombing raids against London in 1917.  These raids
were important, not because of the number of people killed, but
because of the lasting effect on both military and civilian thinking
about strategic bombing after World War I.  1914-19 therefore saw a
very rapid development in the application and technology of air
power, but its effect could not be decisive. Yet the roles for
airpower that we know today, had already emerged: recce, offensive
air, defensive air, interdiction, and transport.</P>

<P>3.	The inability of the military forces to defend England against
strategic bombers, and the lack of any central control over aircraft
procurement policy, led to the recommendation by the Smuts Committee
that a separate air council be formed.  This in turn led to the
formation of the Royal Air Force on 1 April 1918: the event we are
celebrating today.  By June 1918, Sir Frederick Sykes, CAS, was
predicting to the Cabinet that any future war would start with a
knock-out blow directed at the enemy's capital city.  In Italy,
Douhet was developing his theories on the decisive use of strategic
air power.  In the United States, General Billy Mitchell was
promoting the importance of military aircraft and the need for an
independent air arm, and getting court martialled for his pains.</P>

<P>4.	As is so often the case, the copious strategic writings were
not necessarily reflected by the procurement processes of the
government in office.  Certainly, in Britain, the survival of an
independent air force had little to do with the new strategic bombing
doctrine.  Trenchard had been brought back by Churchill to be CAS in
1919.  He showed the effectiveness of air power for imperial
policing, and this was a much more telling argument to successive
governments, who were working on the principle that there would be no
major war within the next ten years.  There is no doubt that it was
Trenchard's leadership as CAS between 1919 and 1929 which ensured
that the Royal Air Force survived as an independent service. He was
also responsible for developing the institutions of the Service which
meant that even in the lean years, it could grow to meet the
challenges of 1939.  Indeed there are many parallels with today, as
the prospect of general war moves from the immediate to the far
future, and we have to ensure that we have an air force which can
meet the current security tasks, but also be able to develop if we
were great threats were to develop again. I shall return to this
theme.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>World War II</H3>

<P>5.	World War II was the Blacksmith's forge of air power. Theories
were tried, tested, tempered or broken against the background of
rapidly developing technology.  The Germans had used the lessons of
the Spanish Civil War, to concentrate airborne fire power in support
of army operations for Blitzkrieg.  Their successes highlighted the
critical importance of command of the air.  The Battle of Britain was
fought for control of British airspace, and there was no doubt as to
the consequences of a German air victory.  The importance of using
sufficient air resources to maintain control of your own airspace,
and to produce a favourable air situation to exploit over the enemy's
territory, was established.  This principle remains valid today.  In
the early years of the war, the lack of accurate night bombing
capability, meant that strategic bombing could not meet the
expectations that had been raised for it.  The ability to attack the
enemy in his homeland, was more of a boost to the morale of the
attacker, than a cause for the catastrophic breakdown of enemy morale
that Douhet had predicted.  To produce results which could affect the
outcome of the war, required accurate target intelligence, careful
target selection and a capability to find and destroy the selected
targets (another theme I will return to).  The bombing offensive
could not by itself be a war-winning operation: it could contribute
by diverting enemy resources. Nevertheless, in the debates about the
role of strategic bombing, which were given new life by the long
overdue statue to Arthur Harris, we must keep in mind that it was for
the darkest period of the War, the only method of taking the battle
to the enemy. </P>

<P>6.	The Battle of the Atlantic was as vital.  Technology had to be
developed to provide aircraft with sufficient range, radar, and
effective attack techniques, if the sea lanes were to be safeguarded.
 In the Pacific in 1941, the Japanese had demonstrated that air power
could be used decisively against surface ships, particularly in a
surprise attack.  In other overseas theatres the effectiveness of
tactical air forces, where joint operations were the key to success,
was demonstrated.  For the final assault on the Continent, all the
air power resources were used to provide total air supremacy over the
battlefield.  Troops were transported into battle by air, and
precision bombing was used to great effect.  Finally air power
demonstrated the ultimate power at Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August
1945, and many of the strategic bombing enthusiasts felt that their
ideas had come to fruition at last.</P>

<H3>Post Second World War</H3>

<P>7.	In the post-war era, air power had made an important
contribution to the outcome of many conflicts.  The Berlin airlift
showed the decisive use of air transport.  Korea showed that the
lessons of World War II had not been made obsolete by the advent of
the nuclear age.  The Malayan operations showed that the mobility
afforded by air power could prove to be more important than offensive
capability.  The Americans in Vietnam used all the conventional roles
of air power.  Interdiction against a low technology enemy proved to
be difficult especially given political constraints.  Air mobility
operations, using helicopters in particular, were developed
successfully, and this is an aspect of air power which still needs
developing.  Strategic air transport provided the essential
supporting lifeline to the whole war effort.  In 1967 the Israelis
demonstrated that air power can be decisive on some occasions when
surprise is possible.  In 1973, the tables were turned with
technological surprise from new ground-based air defence systems. 
The importance of the electronic warfare battle was highlighted.  In
1982, the Falklands War has provided us with a unique example of the
use of air power for conducting operations along greatly extended
lines of communication.  The Vulcan operations from Ascension Island
to Port Stanley showed the enormous reach of airpower in a way never
before conceived. The threat to our Naval forces from Argentinian
aircraft with modern anti-ship missiles, brought home the importance
of control of the air over an ever widening area.  In the same year
the Israelis also showed how technological advantage can affect the
air battle, and reduce losses to zero.  </P>

<P>8.	Less noticed perhaps were the air power lessons of the
Afghanistan campaign through the 80s. The British in Malaya, the
French in Algeria, and the Americans in Vietnam had taken forward the
use of helicopters in counter-insurgency. The Russians had an
impressive range of combat and support helicopters and some fixed
wing airpower to attempt to control Afghanistan. </P>

<H3>The Gulf</H3>

<P>9.	All these operations were significant in the development of
techniques and technologies for the use of airpower, and Trenchard
would have recognised the ways in which air was being used. Yet,
there was little recognition in the wider world of the importance of
the air in any form of military operation. The Gulf War changed all
that. I will not spend long on the operation, for the first time
everyone watched a war close to from start to finish. It was unique -
just as the Falklands had been unique - but it was nevertheless
representative of the new post Cold War style of conflict. There were
of course a multitude of lessons to be learned, as there are after
any war, but let me draw out a few of the key ones. First, the effect
that control of the air has on one's ability to fight. The coalition
had total control of their own airspace, - with the  exception of
Scuds  - and could thus mass enormous ground, sea and air forces to
mount operations at a time of their choosing. On the other hand,
Iraq's air defences were targeted at the start and it rapidly lost
control of its own airspace. This meant freedom to attack any
targets, and to continue the air phase of the operation as long as
was necessary. The attention of the world media can be a mixed
blessing in war, but it is here to stay. This put much greater
emphasis on the use of precision air delivered weapons to minimise
collateral damage. We must not of course forget the role that
non-precision weapons had to play. They are much cheaper
individually, if not for some targets in terms of cost effectiveness.
Where they were most needed was in reducing the fighting capability
of the enemy frontline ground forces. Air superiority made the
continuing pounding by B52s and others possible, and hence reduced
the ground war to a 100 hours.</P>

<P>10.	Since the Gulf War, air operations - real ones - have
continued at an unprecedented rate for peacetime. I will just run
over those which UK forces have been involved in to give a flavour of
what the demands for the future may be. The aftermath of the Gulf War
included the need to protect Kurds in the North and Shias in the
South. For both, airpower was the solution. Helicopters (RAF Chinooks
and RN Sea Kings for the UK) and Hercules to provide humanitarian aid
to the Kurdish refugees, to set up the safe areas, and then offensive
air and air reconnaissance to do much the same job as Trenchard's
Imperial policing of the 20's. Here the UK has provided Jaguars,
which are to be replaced by Harriers. In the South, a similar need
and the UK has provided Tornados to this operation in support of the
Shias.  </P>

<P>11.	The breakup of Yugoslavia has seen a growing involvement by
UK  and other nations forces in support of UN operations. Nimrods
contribute to monitoring the sea for breaches in the embargo. The E3D
Sentry takes its turn with NATO AEW to monitor the no-fly zone. The
Hercules joins the airlift into Sarajevo. Our Carrier stands off with
helicopters and Sea Harriers available. We see the US using airdrops
as their way of contributing to the UN operations without entangling
forces on the ground. One can speculate on many scenarios for the
future of the former Yugoslavia, and airpower will have a significant
role to play in the peacekeeping or peacemaking options.</P>

<P>12.	While considering current operations, we must not forget
Northern Ireland. It ties up a significant part of the Army, and
would use even more were it not for the contribution that helicopters
can make to mobility of these forces. We are also involved in
unpredictable humanitarian relief operations, of which Somalia was
the last, where the UK Government was able to contribute through the
use of Hercules rather than deploy more of our hard pressed troops.
</P>

<H3>Future Operations</H3>

<P>13.	What does all this mean for the future of airpower? The post
Cold War world is in many ways a more uncertain place. The breakup of
the former Soviet Union may have sown the seeds for some bitter
conflicts, which could cause problems within Europe. We have not seen
the endgame of the breakup of Yugoslavia. The Middle East
instabilities have not disappeared and there are threats to our
economic interests. Africa is a vast area containing all the
potential ills of the modern world. Again television brings the
effects of famine to the top of the political agenda, and we need to
be able to contribute assistance. But it is not a peaceful area
either. We need also to be concerned about the growing disparity 
between rich and poor nation, and the signs already of economic
migration. Nor has the threat of nuclear warfare gone. Not only are a
number of less than ideal nations working hard towards their own
nuclear capability, the breakup of the Soviet Union has accelerated
the potential for transfer of technology. Nuclear weapons remain in
Russia, and we are seeing the debate with the Ukraine over future
arrangements.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>14.	It is not my intention to spoil a pleasant evening by
sending you off with portents of doom. The world has been fairly
brutish for most of its history. The Cold War period froze some of
the longstanding disputes for a period, - or the threat of Superpower
confrontation kept the West out -  but at the price of the awesome
risk of general war. In the UK we are now more secure than we have
been for a long time. Our potential adversaries are further away than
before. But this does not mean that we can isolate ourselves from the
happenings everywhere. The United Nations has taken on a more active
role, Europe wishes to be seen to be working at external problems
perhaps through the WEU. The arms control process led to greater
cooperation through the CSCE which looks for a part to play in
improving stability. </P>

<P>15.	Finally we must not forget NATO. For all these operations
which call for the use of military forces from many nations, we need
common procedures,  training, infrastructure and organisation. NATO
has provided this, and is the only organisation in the world on which
we can base sensible multinational military operations. For this
reason it is important that in our enthusiasm for other groups (WEU,
UN, CSCE, EC or whatever), we do not put at risk the only military
one: NATO.</P>

<H3>The Spectrum of Military Capabilities</H3>

<P>16.	What all this means is that we will need armed forces ready
to meet the demands of a wide range of operations. At the lower end
of the conflict spectrum, we have peacekeeping and aid to the civil
authorities. We will need the ability to gain intelligence and
information if we are to capitalise on longer warning times for major
conflict. We will become involved in operations at greater distances
than our NATO centred forces were structured for. In operations with
less than benign conditions, we may need to provide active defences.
This is turn may lead to involvement in more traditional fighting
wars, with the need for the range of offensive capability. At the
high end of the spectrum weapons of mass destruction, and their means
of long range delivery, will be an increasing factor.</P>

<H3>Airpower needs</H3>

<P>17.	So what does all this mean in terms of future airpower
needs. Uncertainty carries with it the need for flexibility. We know,
and now everyone knows, that the first requirement is security of the
mounting base; and that the greatest threat is from the air. This
means that air defence must be a priority whenever hostile action is
possible. And when I talk about a mounting base, remember this will
encompass amphibious shipping, airfields, ports and ground force
concentration areas. When operations are required into or over
hostile territory, the need for gaining control of the air is as
important as ever it was. Satellites have improved the gathering of
both strategic and tactical intelligence, but are complementary to
air reconnaissance, which is unpredictable, rapidly tasked and less
constrained by the weather.  Offensive aircraft are now needed for a
wider range of operations: precision attack, counter-air, degrading
ground, air and naval forces, policing sanctions, and supporting
ground forces. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>18.	For all these operations, from the peacekeeping to the all
out war, mobility is vital. Long range mobility comes from strategic
air lift - coupled with air to air refueling - and also from sea
lift. Tactical mobility places great demand on helicopter resources.
Indeed, if I were to identify just one change to airpower needs in
the new world order, it would be the increased utility of helicopters
for every aspect of operations.</P>

<H3>UK Airpower in Future</H3>

<P>19.	Against this background, on its 75th birthday, how well is
the Royal Air Force set to meet these challenges? For mobility, both
tactical and strategic, the Tristar, VC10, Hercules, Chinook, Puma
and Wessex fleets are in constant daily operational use. For the
future we have firm plans for both modernisation and replacement.
Indeed, even in times of shrinking defence budgets, we have
recognised the need for more helicopters in the future. For
intelligence and reconnaissance in its widest sense, we currently
have the Nimrod MPA - and plans for its replacement, the new Sentry
E3-D AEW fleet, the Tornado GR1as which flew at low level at night
throughout the Gulf war to provide intelligence unobtainable by any
other coalition aircraft. The Jaguars have been providing
reconnaissance over Northern Iraq, and the Harriers are taking over
from them. Tornados with the new TIALD pod are doing the same over
southern Iraq. And still to come is EFA in the recce role. Moving to
air defence, the Tornado F3 has been given a welcome update as a
result of the Gulf modification programme. It will be replaced
progressively by EFA as it comes into service from the end of the
century. For offensive operations, the Tornado GR1 proved its unique
capabilities in the Gulf - as the only aircraft in the early days
capable of taking on key airfields. It remains the RAF's most capable
offensive aircraft, and will be further enhanced by the extensive
mid-life update. It is also taking on the anti-ship role which the
Buccaneer has had up to now. The Harrier update to GR7 which is
nearing completion combines the unique flexibility of the Harrier
with a true night capability. The Jaguar will also be replaced by EFA
in due course. Nor should we forget the equally important weapon and
sensor programmes for the future. EFA will be complemented by beyond
visual range air defence missiles and stand-off air to ground
weapons. </P>

<P>20.	The Royal Air Force is well equipped, and has a future
programme, that is well balanced for the demands of this future
uncertain world. Nor as central staff officer should I forget the
importance that the other Services are attaching to air power. For
the army, a modern attack helicopter is on the cards. For the Navy,
the Sea Harrier is being updated and they have the Merlin on order as
their new ASW helicopter. We are in a time of change, moving to
smaller forces. However, we are also in a time of concentrating on
the forces which can give us the greatest flexibility against the
uncertainty of the future.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Trenchard's View</H3>

<P>21.	In my opening remarks I made some comparisons between
Trenchard's period as CAS between the wars, with today. We too see
the possibility of major European war as only a faint future
possibility, we have responsibilities further afield, but we have an
inclination to reduce expenditure on defence. Are the comparisons
valid? Certainly, we share with Trenchard the need to keep the
necessary expertise to expand (or reconstitute in the jargon) if it
should ever become necessary. We also share the opportunity that he
had to show that air power can make a very cost effective
contribution to the nation's wider security interests. After the Gulf
War, we should not have the same difficulty that he had in convincing
people of the importance of offensive airpower. But perhaps we can
take these comparisons too far. The Royal Air Force today is changing
in response to the new world order. It will be smaller, but will
still be able to carry out all its range of roles. The inventory is
either new, being updated or being replaced. Its training -
epitomised by the College here at Cranwell - remains the envy of the
world. As we pass through the transitional time to the smaller
forces, we have particular manpower management difficulties in all 3
services. In the Royal Air Force, it is important to strike the
balance between keeping the very expensive expertise, but at the same
time bringing in new blood for the future. Lord Trenchard died in
February 1956 as the V-force was building up to provide the
realisation of his concept of all powerful strategic bombing. This
year we see the last vestiges of that force leaving service - the
last Vulcan and the Victor tankers. A new generation of aircraft have
come in , and the next generation is in sight.  There are many
challenges, but if Trenchard had been at Marham with us today, he
could have felt pleased that his air force was changing to meet the
new and future challenges.</P>
