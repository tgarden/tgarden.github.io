power <o:p></o:p></span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>US foreign<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>policy is about promoting the interests
of the United States; but this is true for most nations. Yet those US interests
are served by having growing economies in peaceful societies with which to
trade. Nevertheless, there is a growing concern that this rich, commercial,
high technology, well-armed, superpower is minded to take ever less notice of
the views of other states or the constraints of the international system. The
litany of issues which are dividing America from the rest of the world is
growing longer. They include tariffs on steel, subsidies to farms, lack of
interest in arms control and environmental controls, coupled with antipathy to
the International Criminal Court. The lack of objectivity over Israel is
another source concern to Europeans, as is the apparent unwillingness of the US
to use the international system .<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>US power is based on a
number of inter-related elements. The internal factors include the strong
economy, a lack of focused internal dissent and perhaps a unique culture of
national certainty and pride. The external factors include a long history of
lack of threats from near neighbours, a lack of any global power of equal
capability, and a military machine which surpasses all other<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>nations. The scale of defence spending
and investment in new military technology is truly astonishing under the
circumstances of overwhelming superiority. That is not to say that the US
military is exempt from the difficulties of fast rising defence costs that
other nations suffer from. It has personnel retention, infrastructure and
equipment replacement<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>problems,
and these can be exacerbated<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>by
focus on high technology future systems at the expenses of maintaining current
operational capabilities. But that said, for all the inefficiencies of military
programmes, the US stands in a different league of military capability from any
other nation. The increase in US defence spending<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn1' href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[1]<![endif]></span></span></a>
over the coming years will drive the military technology development at an even
faster pace. The moves towards &quot;transformational capabilities&quot; <a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn2' href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[2]<![endif]></span></span></a>will
shape the US forces in novel ways.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Before 11 September 2001,
it believed that its only large scale vulnerability on its own territory came
from the strategic nuclear capabilities of<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Russia and China, and potentially in the future from
proliferating states of concern. These could be addressed by closer
co-operation and arms control in the case of Russia, and by the use of
technology to provide defensive systems in the case of the proliferating states
and China. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Since the end of the Cold
War, the US has flexed its military muscle in a number of areas. Over the last
decade of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century, it was able to develop a new perspective
on the application of military power: one that was driven by technology..<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Gulf War saw the US in the lead of
a large coalition operating with the full backing of the United Nations to free
Kuwait after invasion by Iraq. The shadows of the Vietnam War were finally laid
to rest as the USA demonstrated that its investment in aerospace technology
could produce a new way of fighting wars. The remorseless prolonged air
campaign meant that the ground operation could be completed with virtually no
casualties to the Allied forces. The theories of generations of air power<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>enthusiasts seemed at last to have been
proved. Yet at the time there was no certainty of such a cost free operation.
Subsequent experience in Somalia showed that it was still possible for the US
military might to be thwarted by an unsophisticated enemy. The casualty free
experience of the Gulf War had set new political standards for the way US
military operations were to be conducted in operations which were not about
defence of the homeland.. Precision air power was seen by some to have been the
key enabler for the Dayton agreement in Bosnia. In Kosovo, the doctrine had
advanced to a stage where the use of ground force in hostile territory was
discounted by President Clinton from the start of operations. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Each campaign reinforced
the message that air power, space systems and precision attack could allow the
US to intervene, change governments, right wrongs and celebrate the American
way without risking GI lives. At the same time this focus on technology has
widened the military capability gap between the US and the rest of the world,
which has had a profound effect on the practicality of Alliance operations. The
French Air Force found itself isolated in the Gulf War because of it years away
from NATO interoperability standards. A decade later, few Allies were invited
to the party in the air over Afghanistan because even the most ardent NATO
allies were failing to keep abreast of the technical standards needed to
operate with the new US systems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Allies are more about political and overflight or basing support these
days than about making a real military contribution to any operation which the
US leads. And if the US is not in the lead, it loses interest rapidly. While
post-conflict operations have been the big activity for European nations and
others over the last decade,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>the
US forces have been reluctant participants, and some would say not too
effective either. The nature and tactics of warfare have changed for the United
States; but its allies have been slow to accommodate to these changes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h1><span style='font-family:Verdana;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>The growth of the
EU as a regional power <o:p></o:p></span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>The European Union has
also changed in the decade since the end of the Cold War. Europe was the region
directly affected by the fall of the Berlin Wall, the end of the Soviet Union
and of the Warsaw Pact. It had lived with a very real and urgent threat of the
ultimately destructive war being fought across its territory, and that threat
disappeared faster than could ever have been imagined. The process of
integration continued particularly with the work towards monetary union. The
now 15 EU nations found themselves at peace with each other, growing more
prosperous, and looking towards enlarging their membership yet further to take
in the states of Central and Eastern Europe and further afield. The EU already
matches the US in terms of GDP, and will draw ahead as it enlarges. It is
already more populous. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>EU members have learned a
number of lessons during the decade of the 90's. Europe suddenly felt safer
than it had in living memory. Defence budgets fell as the worries of the Cold
War were forgotten. Most operational combat forces fell by between 30 and 40%.
Some countries, like the UK, took the opportunity to reshape their armed forces
towards their interpretation of future needs. Others, like Germany, were slower
to restructure. Germany had discovered the time and cost that it took to carry
out the reunification process. To an extent it still bears the financial burden
of its generous arrangement. This has given it a defence<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>squeeze from two different directions:
lack of money and inappropriate military structures. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Yet Europe was also
discovering that it could operate in some aspects as a regional power. Trade
negotiations were much more effective when conducted at the EU level than by
individual states. The EU could restrain unfair practices from any part of the
world, and most particularly could face down the US<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>in trade disputes when necessary. But the EU was still
missing the essential qualification to be regarded as a serious global power
comparable to the US. Foreign and security policy remained largely national
activities. If Europe was threatened directly, then NATO was still the forum to
turn to. Coping with the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia was not a
great success story for the EU as a coherent security organisation. Here was a
part of Europe that was to give troubles for all EU members states as it broke
up. Yet the US was needed to drive through an enforceable settlement in Bosnia;
the US was needed to provide the major warfare contribution to NATO's operation
in Kosovo; and NATO remained in the lead as Macedonia looked as though it might
be destabilised. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h1><span style='font-family:Verdana;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>The EU Defence
Capability<o:p></o:p></span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>The EU found itself with
important regional interests in its backyard, but without the diplomatic and
military cohesion and strength to solve the difficult problems of the region. A
year after the election of a Labour government in the UK in 1997, there began
an important policy development in Britain, that was able to allow an advance
progress on developing EU diplomatic and military power. Previously, the UK had
always been unhelpful to any moves towards greater co-operation on security
policy by EU states. It was feared that this would undermine NATO, and perhaps
lead to a disengagement by the US in the longer term. The Anglo-French summit
at St Malo in late 1998 changed<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>this obstructive agenda. The process over the following months led to a
much more enthusiastic and practical approach to European Defence Policy. The
EU states agreed at Helsinki to work towards specific goals to be able to bring
together military capabilities for particular operations, which were other than
the NATO task of territorial defence. These &quot;Petersberg Tasks&quot; might
involve humanitarian relief, peacekeeping, peace enforcement or conflict
prevention. The capability for Europe was sized to be up to 60,000 troops
available to be<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>deployed in under
two months and sustainable for 12 months, with all the necessary air and sea
power support. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>The work on developing
this modest military capability for the EU is very important. At the 2000
Commitments Conference, EU members indicated what forces they were prepared to
make available at the required notice for EU authorised operations. The
absolute numbers offered were impressive Ð 100,000 troops, 400 combat aircraft
and 100 ships Ð but<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>the packages
were complex. From the UK, the army would provide either an Armoured or
Mechanised brigade, each of which could be sustained for at least a year; or an
Air Assault brigade which would be deployed for up to six months. Combat
Support enabling capabilities such as Artillery, and Short Range Air Defence,
and Attack Helicopters could be deployed in addition. The Navy has committed an
aircraft carrier, two nuclear powered submarines, four destroyers / frigates,
support vessels; and an amphibious task group, including one helicopter landing
platform and an amphibious brigade. The aircraft carrier, helicopter landing
platform and submarines could not necessarily be sustained continuously for a
whole year. In the air, the UK has offered up to 72 combat aircraft (including
Sea Harriers, which are<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>now to be
phased out under national plans), with associated support aircraft including
strategic transport. This number would be available for six months to cover
initial theatre entry. For a longer term commitment the total would reduce. As
can be seen, the offer has constraints on time that may not fully meet the
Helsinki requirement, and other nations will need to be able to fill the gaps.
As time passes, some of the promises cannot be fulfilled because of reductions
in national force structures.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>As the work has continued,
it has become clear that gaps in major enabling capabilities, that had already
been identified in NATO work under the Defence Capabilities Initiative<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn3' href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[3]<![endif]></span></span></a>,
remain. The list of these deficiencies is long. They include such elements as
the necessary air and sea transport to deploy European forces with their
equipment. There is insufficient air to air refuelling support for all the
military aircraft which might be deployed on operations. While the Cold War has
left us with many air defence fighters, procured against the threat of Soviet
bombers, Europe lacks the precision all weather offensive capabilities that we
have become used to in US operations. Reconnaissance and Intelligence
capabilities both at the strategic and the tactical level are fragmented
between nations even when they exist. Few Europeans can plug directly into the
operational data sources which US forces are beginning to take for granted in
any military operation at any level. Deployable command and control
capabilities are essential these days, and must be able to link back to the
operational headquarters which may be on the other side of the world. If the
use of air power is to be the preferred initial phase for any conflict, the
ability to suppress enemy air defences is crucial; and is another missing piece
in the jigsaw of European capabilities. Even secure interoperable
communications are less than universal. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>At the Prague Summit of
November 2002, NATO looked to reduce the list of 59 weaknesses to a handful, in
the hope that members will at least address the most important. A similar
exercise in the Helsinki Headline Goal process is trying to put pressure on EU
members to fill these gaps. The approaches are still fragmented. The lack of
strategic air transport has been turned into a question of European joint
procurement rather than one of European joint capability. The funding for the
A400M strategic air transport project becomes the test of how strong a nation
supports European defence. Yet the capability is needed now, not at some
indeterminate time in the future. It is a low technology requirement which
could be filled by a range of solutions available on the market today.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

with the EU needs. Europe needs to be able to work with the USA in the security
field; and Europe also needs to be able to look after its own interests when
they do not align with those of the US. The institutions are developing within
the EU to manage these aspirations, and the EU Convention may start to address
some of the difficulties of the institutional barriers to coherent security
policy. The good work in Justice and Home Affairs that followed 11 September
has shown that sovereignty issues can be overcome when there is a pressing
need. The question still to be answered is how do we make some move on the
capabilities issue? National defence budgets are overstretched everywhere in
Europe, and problems have sharpened since 11 September as new urgent priorities
for security spending have been added. Even in the UK, the signs of British
military decline continue as capability after capability is phased out early.

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
normal cry from the defence specialist is that the Europeans must increase
defence spending. It is true that the EU nations in total are now spending less
half of the amount that the US spends on defence. Yet when they were spending
60% of US defence spending at the time of Kosovo, they could provide less than
20% of the effort for the air campaign. We get very poor value from European
defence spending. There are 15 armies, 14 air forces and 13 Navies, all with
their command structures, headquarters, logistics organisations, training
infrastructure. Some with similar equipment, others with quite incompatible
units. All are in decline as the effect of fast rising personnel and equipment
costs take their toll. If this was a multinational business, the answer would
be self evident. Streamline the company so that the overheads for small non-viable
branches could be covered by common services. Unless the Europeans start
rationalising their military capabilities now, they will individually and
progressively cease to have any useful global, and eventually even national,
role. In Britain, we have become used to the remorseless rationalisation
process in defence as our costs rise faster than normal domestic inflation.
After the SDR, the UK may have now approached the limits of rationalisation at
the national level. France has recognised this difficulty with a serious
increase in defence spending. Germany has more national options, as it still
has an internal rationalisation process to go through; but this will be
politically very difficult.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

text-autospace:none'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Verdana;mso-ansi-language:
EN-US'>All proposals for more capable European forces will require serious
investment. While European nations are to a greater or lesser extent
restructuring their forces, there is little sign that new money will be made
available for new capabilities. Defence budgets at best are held level in real
terms, and this is insufficient to fund either major new capabilities, or
maintain force levels over a period of time. Yet plans for specialist
contributions, such as the NATO Response Force<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn6'
href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[6]<![endif]></span></span></a>
proposal of 2002, will need early funding if they are to be achieved. In
addition, there is a range of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>modern enabling capabilities which are needed throughout Europe and will
remain unaffordable by individual nations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Verdana;mso-ansi-language:
EN-US'>There are three complementary pressures on European nations to start taking
forward pooling of some force elements. First, pooling offers the opportunity
for lower overhead costs, and the resources released might then be used to fund
new enabling capabilities including the proposed<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>strike force. Second, pooling would make the new enabling
capabilities more affordable on a shared basis. Thirdly, pooled forces would
drive moves towards greater interoperability and common doctrine and equipment.
If<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>suitable transformational
capabilities were operated on a pooled basis, they could act as the motivating
drive for nations to start transforming their national capabilities in order to
exploit the shared enabling capability.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Verdana;mso-ansi-language:
EN-US'>There is one other consideration which could increase the attractiveness
of pooled capabilities to European governments. The experience of the
Afghanistan campaign has increased doubts about the relevance of NATO to future
high intensity campaigns. The only NATO contribution was its one joint owned
joint operated (pooled) force: AWACs. All other contributions to the US
operation in Afghanistan were arranged on a bilateral national basis. If NATO
is to be seen as relevant as an organisation for future operations, it would
benefit not only from fielding<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>European capabilities which were able to operate alongside US forces,
but also by fielding them as NATO or EU joint owned joint operated
capabilities. This would mean that Europe would be in the loop over any
decision to use such force elements.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
smaller nations are moving down the path of integration already as they lose
capabilities. The joint naval arrangement between the Dutch and the Belgians is
a good illustration of what is possible. Of course shared capabilities are not
new. There are many things which we have today which could be pooled. Air
transport is a good example, and Germany has set up an organisation which could
manage such an arrangement. Again to produce capability and cost benefits, it
needs to be done with what is in place now, not on the back of some
uncompetitive long term European procurement plan. Much of the equipment which
could be pooled is American, because that is where common capabilities exist.

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>One of
the great missed opportunities, both from the military and commercial<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>aspect, has been the failure of states
to pool the Eurofighter force. With a pooled force the support costs would
have<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>been much less, and the
aircraft configuration control could be maintained unlike the Tornado. It would
also allow smaller European nations to buy a handful of Eurofighters to add to
a much larger force. The cost benefits between such a Eurofighter buy, JSF or
upgrades to F16 or F18s might work out very differently then. Failing to pool
the Eurofighter means it will cost far more to operate and do far less than it
could have done with a little more imagination. It will also sell to fewer
European countries.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Even if
the politics of such pooling of major combat capabilities are too difficult,
there are opportunities for less contentious sharing of costly capabilities. In
particular contracted out services or<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Public Private Partnership projects<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn9'
href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

could be done on a European wide basis instead of nationally. Removing the EU
competition exemption for defence contracts might help this process on its way.
In any case, pork Barrel politics lead to many of the poor value for money
equipment decisions throughout<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Europe.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana;color:black'>These examples
suggest some practical areas where the development of European Force Elements
and common support and logistic services could provide building blocks for the
strengthening of European defence contributions. They would make more effective
use of European national defence budgets through the removal of the cost
overhang of separate support systems. Valuable as such individual initiatives
would be, they would not by themselves represent a coherent new security
contribution by Europe. They would however illustrate how significant
improvements in effectiveness could be achieved through merging particular
national capabilities and sharing common services.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana;color:black'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana;color:black'>For this
approach to become coherent, it would be necessary to develop a planning and
budgetary system at the European level.&nbsp; Eventually there would be a requirement
for a European Defence Budget. If such an accounting system were managed by the
EU, members would provide either defence capability or money as their
contribution. This would have a number of beneficial effects: not only would
the free ride be stopped, but nations would probably prefer to improve their
military capabilities rather than to contribute money to the employment and
industries of other nations. Peer pressure, as well as legally binding
commitments. to a given level of defence expenditure, might come to seem
markedly more compelling to the participants than the distinctly low key
incentives that have characterised NATO co-operation. A virtuous circle of
improved military capability and effective European defence could be
established. There would be many problems in assessing the true worth of each
contribution, but the process would also make the planning and audit at the
European level more effective.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>The
military security dimension is important for Europe in its future relations
with the US. To be cast in the role of sweeper up after America is not an
enticing prospect. Without addressing the shortfalls in military
capability,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>EU member states will
find themselves less and less able to operate individually or collectively with
the US to support their common interests. Nor will they have a strong voice in
where and how future operations are conducted. Yet Europe will be expected to
take on the post conflict tasks as a share of the transatlantic burden. Kosovo
was NATO's first and last war, and the future arrangements will be much more
about Europeans and Americans operating together or separately. NATO will
survive as a place for dialogue, and perhaps as a useful organisation to set
common military standards, but even then interoperability will decline<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>if the technology gap becomes too
great.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span style='font-family:Verdana'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>The
national politics of much greater defence integration are difficult. But there
are opportunities which would produce more capability for lower cost with no
effect on sovereignty. Those benefits must be used to grow the missing European
enabling capabilities, and that will need the EU to control funds. The
&quot;European Army&quot; is used as the spectre to frighten the national
voters. Yet, there is nothing to fear from a long term vision of<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>a European Army, but it would require
reform of the EU institutions first. It will be a long time coming, if ever;
but that does not mean<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>that nothing
can be done. What European Defence needs more than anything is political
leadership. In this respect the UK is singularly well placed. Britain could be
a leader<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>in making Europe a global
player, rather than just a follower in US national priorities. At the same
time, Europe would be able to afford to develop its military capabilities in a
rational way. People and politicians should make<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>getting better value for national defence spending an issue.
By doing that the gap between US and European capabilities could be closed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
