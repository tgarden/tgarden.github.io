			<p>Group One, addressing the new security agenda had a wide mix of expertise including politicians, diplomats, officials, academics, former military and journalists. We had been set a demanding task list by our introducer.  Our excellent chairman slipped effortlessly back into his one time  MOD role of keeping disparate vested interest groups  focused on  key strategic issues. <br>
				<br>
				We  reordered our  tirets so that we could start  with a discussion on the future relevance of NATO.  There was strong support from some old NATO hands for Article V - the attack on one is an attack on all commitment - as the continuing core  requirement. But the question that kept coming back to haunt us through the day was the one which Adair Turner had posed in his introduction for group 2: &quot;What  if Berlin and London had been the targets on 11 September?&quot;  We never achieved a consensus on how the US NATO or Europe would or could  have reacted, although perceptions clearly shaped views when we came to the later discussion about European military capabilities.<br>
				<br>
				 There was some support for a future NATO as a political rather than  military organisation. Others wanted NATO  for practical reasons  to make coalitions of the willing possible.  <br>
				<br>
				A British academic suggested that NATO is becoming more like the Warsaw Pact - a security organisation which covered a series of bilateral arrangements with their superpower. A journalist  found the current situation alarming. NATO is still debating its old security agenda, yet the threats to its members are new, real and urgent. The Europeans seem still to  be in competition for how little they can do.<br>
				<br>
				By the end of this phase of the  discussion we had split into three groups: Officials fairly confident about NATO's continuing utility and viability, journalists deeply concerned, and academics and politicians covering the bet each way, but perhaps more  siding with the pessimists. And we were warned by those who know the US establishment thinking that the relevance of NATO was being increasingly questioned.<br>
				<br>
				The coming summit at Prague will be a testing time for the Europeans . The US is intent on  making NATO focus on new threats and capabilities. Enlargement and relations with Russia will also be important - and our group spend time on all these issues . Was there emerging, by design or default , some division of labour between the US and Europe in the security field? The group held differing views on the relative importance of the nation building tasks against the quick in and out combat strategy in the war against terrorism. Yet all seem to agree that it would be a bad thing if  the tasks were divided on the  basis that Europe does peacekeeping and the US does warfighting.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				A visitor to  the group was clear that NATO will become a &quot;provincial little OSCE&quot; if we divide tasks between US and Europe. It was even suggested that we need a Harmel 2 after Prague to build into NATO the two requirements of war fighting and post conflict rebuilding. But there seemed little enthusiasm among those who have to work in NATO<br>
				<br>
				On WMD there are different threat perceptions across the Atlantic, and different strategic approaches. The preferred European approach is &quot;Diplomacy, deterrence and development&quot;, the US view is to pre-empt. And in discussion on homeland security priorities after 11 September, we explored the danger of focusing too closely on national solutions rather than regional ones.<br>
				<br>
				Having addressed the future of NATO and  the strategy and  tasks after 11 September, we turned then to European military capability. Earlier one journalist had  said &quot; the quickest way to decide if we are serious is money&quot; . He therefore drew the conclusion that  Europe is not serious.<br>
				<br>
				One former military man  graphically described the decline in the UK military capability. Another predicted that the decline  would continue even if spending levels kept pace with domestic inflation. Interoperabillty with the US will continue to worsen and Europe cannot fight wars without the US.  Somewhat unusually the criticism of British overstatement of its military power was strong from the group, while criticism of German defence budget and speed of military reform was more muted. The chairman soon pulled us back from discussing the future of conscription.<br>
				<br>
				There was little expectation of significant rises in European national defence budgets, although one member thought that the EU could generate the momentum for increases if it wanted to. The enthusiast for military integration and pooling offered a menu of ways to spend the 150 million Euros of EU defence budgets  a year more effectively.<br>
				<br>
				We were told that Germany often finds itself outmanoeuvred by an Anglo-French axis on ESDP, and the French view seems to hold sway. This gave us an opportunity for the traditional critique of the French, in which we worried about an anti-American agenda in some quarters.<br>
				<br>
				But nevertheless Europe had done something very specific on defence with the Helsinki Headline Goals. We checked how they were going.. Those involved were pretty upbeat, but others were concerned that there were still gaps in the key enabling capabilities, and no clear plan on how to fill these gaps. As a result it was suggested that the rapid deployment capability was drifting into being the long term non mobile force for the Balkans. <br>
				<br>
				We turned in our final session to relations with others and in particular the discussion focused on Russia. We learned of the difficulties of getting the new arrangements between Russia and NATO to be satisfactory for both parties. But there was general agreement that we needed to make them work.  The US wanted progress, but was also concerned about undermining the Alliance.. It was suggested the US push might have more to do with oil than European security, or a wish to engage Russia as a member of the Security Council, to legitimise intervention operations in Iraq and elsewhere. To this new relationship was added the problem of further  NATO enlargement, and not all were certain that it would be easy for some sections of the Russian establishment to accept. <br>
				<br>
				In short Group One was concerned in many ways by the transatlantic security divide. The tensions come from the yawning gap in defence budgets, but also the different perceptions of  the threats. Even when the threat was agreed the strategies to counter it differed. The Europeans would have to do more on the hard security side, and they would need to restructure forces, cooperate more closely and provide more money to do it. At the same time they need to convince their most important ally, the United States, that soft security and nation building are  important: both to gain more credit for what Europe does, but also to get the US to do more. NATO is changing, and the relationship with Russia will change it further. Its future is not assured, but is important to us in Europe. European defence co-operation can help keep NATO relevant, even if future military operations are more likely to be ad hoc coalitions of the willing and able. But in the end many in the group seemed less than confident that Europe was addressing the new security agenda. </p>
