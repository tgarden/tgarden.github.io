<P>Ten years after the end of the Cold War, there is no lack of work
for the world's military. The international community had hardly had
time to celebrate its resolution of the Kosovo crisis, than new calls
for humanitarian intervention in East Timor were being made. As these
three books show, it is hard for publishers to keep up with the
latest examples of humanitarian intervention. Civil wars, ethnic
cleansing, gang warfare, and internal repression are not new
phenomena. What is new is the ease with which modern communications
can bring the horrors of conflict to millions of comfortable living
rooms on the other side of the globe. The liberal democracies still
spend enormous sums of money on maintaining standing armed forces
despite the absence of any immediate direct threat to their
territorial integrity. It is scarcely surprising that this has led to
an increasing hope that these forces can be used to reestablish the
rule of law in ever more distant trouble spots. The Gulf War showed
that international order could be restored by a coalition of military
powers, without many casualties to the United Nations' sponsored
forces . Bosnia reinforced the message that diplomacy needed to be
backed by a real threat of the use of force, if a settlement was to
be achieved. In Kosovo, NATO conducted operations without a clear
United Nations mandate, and was not prepared to risk the use of
ground forces. In East Timor, ground forces were proposed from the
start despite a degree of uncertainty about the degree of
co-operation from the Indonesian military. We see therefore a
continuing progression in the willingness of many nations to act for
largely humanitarian reasons, where, in earlier times, the doctrine
of non intervention in the internal affairs of sovereign states was
the norm.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>These three books deal in different ways with the issues raised by
this new approach to international relations. Mary Kaldor believes
that the organised violence, seen in Africa and the Balkans over the
past 20 years, is not the same as the old civil wars. She sees these
"post modern wars" as being a feature of globalisation. It is
arguable whether the nature of internal conflicts has really changed
that much, but it is certainly true that the responses from the rest
of the world are being transformed because of global
interconnectedness and interdependence. She explains her concept of
old wars by briefly summarising the early 19th Century writings of
Karl von Clausewitz. His study "On War" remains a key treatise on the
use of military force in relations between States, but it still has
relevance in the modern world of international alliances.
Bosnia-Herzegovina is taken as a case study for the typical new war.
Kaldor claims that Yugoslavia was probably the most militarised
country in Europe outside the Soviet Union. This is based on an
incorrect statement that until 1986 only Greece devoted a higher
percentage of its GNP to military spending. In fact there were
perhaps as many as ten European states exceeding Yugoslavia's
figures. Nevertheless, her description of the difficulties that the
international community faced in solving this Balkan problem is fair.
Many would argue that Clausewitz would have recognised those
difficulties, and that his advice would still have been relevant.
After the Dayton agreement, Kaldor believes that there are two
possible future scenarios for Europe. The first is characterised by
partition of warring parties, and the second looks for building a
co-operative society based on humanitarian principles and the rule of
law. In looking to approaches for future crises, she argues strongly
for the need to reconstruct legitimacy, and rightly draws attention
to the importance of war crimes tribunals and the creation of the
International Criminal Court. It is unfortunate that the Kosovo
crisis is not examined, as that raised other paradoxes over
legitimacy. Was it right for NATO to intervene for humanitarian
reasons without specific United Nations authority? The book offers
hope for some form of transnational law enforcement arrangement
emerging, and does not dismiss the idea that this might be under the
auspices of an enlarged NATO. After Kosovo, this may have been taken
a step further.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In "Contemporary Conflict Resolution", Hugh Miall, Oliver
Ramsbotham and Tom Woodhouse take a more evolutionary approach to the
development of thinking about conflicts. They ask themselves whether
the world is, as Mary Kaldor argues, facing a fundamentally new kind
of conflict, where the old theories no longer apply. However they
argue cogently that the developing tradition of thinking about
conflict and its resolution is becoming even more relevant to the
problems of today. This scholarly volume launches straight into a
game theory approach to conflict which will be familiar to any
nuclear strategist of the Cold War period. The classic model of the
"Prisoner's Dilemma", where two players must choose whether or not to
co-operate with each other, has direct application to the current
problems of two hostile communities living together. The analysis of
the role of a third outside party in brokering the best outcome for
the two parties has great relevance to the role that the
international community is increasingly taking on for itself. They
look at the problems that the United Nations, regional organisations
and Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs) have in taking on this
third party role. The hope that, after the Cold War, the United
Nations could become an effective agent for conflict resolution has
not yet been fulfilled. The authors remind us of its successes in
Namibia, Cambodia, El Salvador and Mozambique; and also of the dismal
failures in Somalia, Bosnia and Rwanda.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The record of regional organisations is seen as even more patchy.
Europe is well endowed with institutions (OSCE, EU, WEU, NATO,
Council of Europe) which should have a role in conflict resolution.
In other parts of the world, the regional groupings are less
effective or non-existent. As the book indicates, regional
organisations have the advantage of proximity to the source of
conflict and familiarity with the main actors, cultural values and
local conditions. They have sometimes the disadvantage of being too
closely involved with the disputing parties. Filling the remaining
gaps are the humanitarian and non-governmental agencies. The
International Committee of the Red Cross has a long and distinguished
history in this role, but there are now over 500 NGOs concerned with
conflict prevention and management.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In a chapter on preventing violent conflict, Miall, Ramsbotham and
Woodhouse look at Macedonia, Albania and Kosovo in the 1990s as case
studies. The Macedonia experience, which saw the first ever UN
deployment of a preventative peacekeeping operation in 1993, is a
good example of how a small force used early can stabilise a
potential flashpoint. Albania is shown as an example of the
difficulties there are in assessing what factors will trigger
conflict. The anarchy stemming from failed pyramid selling schemes
was stabilised by the Italian led UN intervention. Reviewing Kosovo,
the authors conclude correctly, at the time of their writing in
September 1998, that it had gone well past the stage of conflict
prevention. For approaches to a solution in Kosovo or in East Timor,
the reader must turn to the sections on ending violent conflict and
post-settlement peacebuilding. South Africa, Israel -Palestine and
Northern Ireland are used as case studies to show the complexity of
the process. Peace processes take a long time. While the primary
responsibility for preventing, managing and transforming violent
internal conflict lies with the domestic populations, the authors
conclude that outsiders are essential to help the process. Rightly,
they argue that the international community has no option but to
become involved, and that is their hope for a more peaceful future.
"Contemporary Conflict Resolution" deserves to become a standard work
in the field.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Michael Edwards, who is a Civil Society specialist at the World
Bank, takes up the story where the other two volumes conclude. His
long field experience with Oxfam and Save the Children have given him
a passion for finding practical ways to make the world a better
place. "Future Positive" is an optimistic vision of how to get to a
future where people co-operate universally to end injustice, poverty
and conflict. After the horrors that he has experienced at first
hand, it is heartening that he can hold such idealistic views of how
the world might be changed. He dismisses the imposed solution, which
ignores individual responsibility. He argues that every person can
make a difference by demonstrating co-operative behaviour wherever
they are. Yet, as he readily admits, the devil is in the detail.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Aid to the poorer nations needs to be targeted to encourage
development goals, rather than the disappointing restrictive system
that has emerged over the past 50 years. He looks for the same rules
to be applied internationally to all peoples. He advocates a global
regime which is "light but firm" rather than the current one which is
"heavy and loose". He is at his most optimistic when he looks at how
such a system might emerge. He starts with the importance of ethics,
but admits the difficulties of turning philosophical thought into
political reality. As we have seen in recent British foreign policy,
an ethical doctrine is easy to describe but difficult to deliver. He
believes that it is possible to convince people that they can affect
the future well-being of their children by their actions today. He
admits that international co-operation is one of the least popular of
causes, but blames the way the message has been communicated. If this
is the start of a new way of communicating the message, it is to be
welcomed; but the realist will have little hope of it changing the
selfish way that the world conducts its business. In all of politics,
we see short term self interest winning the votes in elections. While
a Prisoner's Dilemma analysis might show that a co-operative strategy
would provide the best global outcome, most voters, and their
representatives, adopt the parochial views, which makes everyone a
loser. This is at its worst in the United States. Edwards deserves to
be read widely: we all know that what he says is sensible, but still
a long way from being achievable.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Some common themes emerge from these three books. The
international community has a role in promoting peace, prosperity and
security throughout the world. Early action to prevent a crisis is
always the best approach. Top down imposed solutions are never
enough. People must learn that co-operation is good for them as well
as for their neighbours, and most importantly for their children.
