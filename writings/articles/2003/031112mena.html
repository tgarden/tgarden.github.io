			<h3><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The Causes of Conflict</font></h3>
		</div>
		<div align="left">
			<h3><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">External state to state threats</font></h3>
			<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">It is often said that conflict in the 21st Century will be less about wars between  states,  and more about internal disorder and the actions of non-state actors. This may prove to be an over-optimistic assumption for the MENA region, and indeed for the wider world. Disputes between neighbouring countries can arise from a range of issues, some of which may be overlapping. These may include:<br>
					<br>
					a. Territorial and border disputes<br>
					b. Resource disputes<br>
					c. Ethnic and religious divides<br>
					d. Arms race fears<br>
					e. Concerns about WMD development<br>
					f.  Regional power status ambitions<br>
					g. Implications of third party foreign military bases<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					There are also inter-state wars which may not involve countries from the immediate neighbouring regions. Both Afghanistan and Iraq were case of attacks by a distant power, the United States, on countries. Such conflicts can arise from similar concerns to those listed as regional causes for conflict. It may be that a power decides to act on behalf on an ally in the region, or is looking to pre-empt or solve a perceived longer term threat to its interests. The US national security strategy of September 2002 explains that this will be a continuing aspect of US foreign policy with or without allies. The UN may also decide that military intervention is needed,  and this may result in distant operations by nations. This is particularly likely when weak governance results in widespread disorder, and a humanitarian disaster may result.  Both the US and EU have indicated their particular concerns about the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Military intervention remains an option if a new threat emerges.</font></p>
			<h3><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">External non-state actor threats</font></h3>
			<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Although non-state actors have given rise to conflict in many parts of the world,  until recently most operated over comparatively  short ranges. Terrorists and secessionist movements normally had a political aim and operated either from within a state, or based in neighbouring sympathetic countries. The rise of international terrorism has attracted global attention since the attacks by al-Qaeda on the USA in 2001. There had been some smaller scale and less successful attacks in the preceding years. This movement draws its strength from a particular interpretation of Islam. Much of the MENA region is susceptible to Islamic fundamentalist movements.  International terrorism is therefore a key factor in the security equation of  relationships between its target countries and the region.</font></p>
			<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">There is one other non-state actor threat to governments which can give rise to conflict. International crime is now so profitable that the effects can threaten the stability of governments.  It may on occasion be necessary to take on criminals in a para military fashion. However,  the effect may be more subtle through the undermining of good governance through widespread corruption. Corrupt leadership and officialdom can generate dissent among the governed , which in turn leads to conflict.</font></p>
			<h3><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Internal non-state actor threats </font></h3>
			<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The third source of conflict is internal. Secessionist movements may arise from a feeling of injustice, historical events, ethnic or religious divisions, or political motives. In countries where representation of minority views is suppressed, the pressure will increase and other methods for justice will be used. Civil disorder can undermine governments and make things worse. Arbitrary or punitive measures by governments can lead to conflict. Where groups have natural supporters in neighbouring countries dissent may be encouraged. <br>
					<br>
					In weak states and post-conflict states, there may also be an opportunity for opportunist crime to become the rule. Warlords seize power and extract money, or the poor become poorer through looting and stealing from the weakest elements of society.</font></p>

			<h3><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The Risks to the MENA  Region</font></h3>
		</div>
		<div align="left">
			<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Almost all the potential causes of conflict outlined above are present within the region, and many are getting worse or are changing little. We have seen a real war in Iraq in 2003. There remains the possibility that the US, without or without UN approval,  will use a similar strategy in Iran or Syria. The strength of US response to any state, which is found to have given direct support to al-Qaeda, should not be underestimated.  Saudi Arabia and Egypt remain under suspicion in this respect by some in the US administration. The US is able and willing to use military force where necessary throughout the region. It can range from a drone attacking a single convoy in Yemen to a full scale war in Iraq.<br>
					<br>
					Israel continues to be concerned about its internal and external security. Since September  2000, the increasing cycle of violence between Palestinians and Israelis has worsened the security situation considerably. The ability of US engagement in the latest Road Map proposals to stop the violence has still to be shown.  The situation has given problems for Jordan with their large Palestinian population.  Israel has had the threat from Iraq eliminated by US action, but will still worry about nuclear developments in Iran, and also the strategy of Syria.<br>
					<br>
					Iran fears Israeli nuclear weapons,  US intervention, and internal dissent. It does not now need to fear Iraq as a state. It seems probable that it has decided that it needs to proceed with the acquisition of its own nuclear capability to deter attack. This will be a cause for concern for its neighbours and the wider world.<br>
					<br>
					Saudi Arabia is in difficulty. Its main ally, the US, is now less reliable. Iraq can provide both bases and oil for the west, and this means that Saudi cannot expect deference from the US any longer. The removal of American forces also makes it more vulnerable, and may be seen by some in the region as a victory for al Qaeda. Disparity of wealth, corruption,  and resentment may lead to internal conflict in Saudi Arabia. This may be actively desired by those who support the more extreme Islamists.<br>
					<br>
					Egypt continues to find it is impossible to grow its economy fast enough to satisfy the poor in its population. The military and  police keep order with a heavy hand which may store up more support for dissidents. However,  they are less vulnerable to internal conflict in the near term than others in the region. It shows few signs of being able to loosen the authoritarian rule.<br>
					<br>
					The Maghreb has felt the effects of 9/11, Israel-Palestine and the Iraq war. Leaders tried to avoid irritating the White House, but their populations have become more anti-American. North African citizens form a significant proportion of those alleged to be involved in al-Qaeda terrorist planning and operations.<br>
					<br>
					In all the region, there is a sense of an uncertain future. Iraq, Israel and al Qaeda are the keys to the immediate security prospects for the region. Saddam Hussein was an unpopular leader both inside and outside Iraq. Yet in power politics terms, he provided regional stability through his repressive regime. If the US fails to transform Iraq into a viable stable state, there may be some unhelpful new pressures for conflict. Turkey remained remarkably uninvolved in the Iraq war. The prospect of an independent Kurdish state in the north of Iraq would change this. Likewise, Iran might see some attractions in a closer relationship with a breakaway Shia region in the South.<br>
					<br>
					The future of Israel and Palestine is as important for regional stability. To turn the tide of anti- American feeling, a success is needed which shows that Palestinians have a future. Whether this is achievable is arguable. If the cycle of violence continues, there will be plenty of recruits for terrorism both within the region and beyond.<br>
					<br>
					The third element is how the international community decides to deal with al Qaeda and associated terrorism. It is not clear that a military strategy on its own will necessarily reduce the risks. The success of the Afghanistan operation undoubtedly made it more difficult for al-Qaeda to train and co-ordinate future operations. However,  the disorder that now reigns outside Kabul may have sown the seeds for future terrorism. Dealing with current terrorists requires the usual mix of police, intelligence, military and financial effort. It will prevent some terrorist attacks, but not all. On current form, the MENA region will remain prone to such attacks and this will have an adverse effect on many economies. What can be done is to concentrate on reducing the causes for support of al Qaeda. This requires less repression, better economies, justice before the law, and a genuine alliance of East and West.</font></p>
			<h3><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">What are the Threats to Us?</font></h3>
			<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Attacks on our homelands &#150; through terrorism and/or wmd<br>
					Attacks on our global interests: energy particularly.<br>
					Attacks on our allies<br>
					International crime and corruption<br>
					Adverse effects on the international system: human rights and rule of law </font></p>
			<h3><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">From a military/diplomatic perspective &#150; who are the &quot;we&quot;?</font></h3>
			<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The international community is deeply involved in the region in many different ways. The key organisations are:<br>
					UN SC<br>
					USA and US led coalitions of the willing<br>
					Quartet (UN, EU, US and Russia) for MEPP<br>
					NATO<br>
					EU<br>
					Perhaps inner core EU of UK, France and Germany</font></p>
			<h3><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">What capabilities do we have to meet those threats</font></h3>
			<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">High intensity short offensive war capability which has no equal in the region.<br>
					US has full range of power projection. EU rather less so.<br>
					Lack of sustainable capability for extensive post conflict security work.<br>
					Surprisingly poor intelligence capability.<br>
					Mixed range of conflict prevention capabilities.</font></p>
			<h3><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">What are the lessons of recent interventions?</font></h3>
			<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Looking at how those capabilities have been used in the region in recent times, the lesson might be that we (US plus allies) can defeat any country there in a traditional state to state war. Both Gulf Wars and Afghanistan make that clear. What is less clear is whether we either have the right startegy or approach to putting humpty dumpty together again afterwards. The French felt they needed 500,000 troops for Algeria, we have a tiny stabilising force of 5000 for ISAF in Kabul with perhaps twice that number chasing around the hills looking for OBL. IN Iraq the US has 120,000 with perhaps another 20,000 from allies. It is clear that this is inadequate but they are unable to sustain even this number.</font></p>
			<h3><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Where, when and how will we use military force?</font></h3>
			<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Afghanistan and Iraq continue into the future &#150; perhaps NATO<br>
					Israel Palestine will need peacekeeping force or intervention if all goes bad.<br>
					Iran may become centre for international diplomatic pressure backed by threat of force.<br>
					Syria remains on US list of possible rogues states (as does Libya with less cause)<br>
					Algeria, Saudi Arabia and Egypt both have internal stability problems. </font></p>
			<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">However the Iraq experience may have made it less likely that interventions will happen.</font></p>
			<h3><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">What changes to force posture are needed therefore?</font></h3>
			<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Resources need to increase to provide:<br>
					Rapid deployment of forces<br>
					Good Intelligence<br>
					Sustainability</font></p>
			<h3><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Final Questions</font></h3>
			<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Do we need more capable weapon systems? If so for what against whom?<br>
					What can we do to improve conflict prevention in this region?<br>
					Can we reduce oil dependence?<br>
					Do we know how to build an Islamic democracy from scratch?</font></p>
