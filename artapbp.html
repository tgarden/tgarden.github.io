<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>Introduction</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Returning to the University of Birmingham to talk about Air Power,
reminded me of my first Air Power conference in 1982 - some of the
audience were there then as well. How easy it was to set the agenda
then. We had a well defined threat - and could call on experts to
explain how it would develop in the future. We had a defence budget
growing at 3% per year in real terms, and we had no lack of
technological prophets to tell us of the Dan Dare air forces of the
future.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I am afraid that tonight, I am likely to be much more hesitant in
my forecasts of where British air power is going. For the first time
in 60 years, Britain can make genuine choices about its level of
military activity and where it wishes to focus its efforts. I will
quickly skate over the factors which will influence that analysis,
look at what we might expect in terms of co-operation from the rest
of the world community and then narrow my view to some of the options
which air power can give us.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>Strategic Context</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>What sort of a world have we inherited in the aftermath of the
Cold War? From a UK viewpoint, the answer must be that we are
immeasurably safer. This may seem an overstatement when we completed
a major military operation in the Gulf only 4 years ago, the papers
are full of our troops' exploits in the Former Yugoslavia, and
nuclear concerns about North Korea continue to surface. Despite all
this, since the demise of the Warsaw Pact, followed by that of the
Soviet Union, the direct threat to these islands has all but
disappeared. I make no assumptions about future developments, I am
merely looking at those countries with the military power projection
to reach the UK today and judging whether they could have any
conceivable reason for using it against us.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In the longer term, direct threats might re-emerge if NATO
atrophied and Russia grew stronger. In a very particular way we might
come within range of ballistic missiles acquired by more distant
hostile countries, but that is still some way off. It is of course
possible to construct scenarios which would give more short term
concern. A sudden change of direction in Russia and the
externalisation of problems; or the tension between former Soviet
Union republics, and in particular Ukraine and Russia, spilling over
to a more major conflict in which perhaps the decaying nuclear
armoury was used. But in all of these the old Cold War expectation of
a war across the whole of Central Europe is no longer valid.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Even so war in Europe is not just possible, but is actually
happening. One price of the end of the Cold War has been the growth
of local conflicts: old scores to be settled, ethnic and racial
disputes, economic tensions, and sheer brigandry. The disintegration
of the former Yugoslavia has been the most visible, but within the
former Soviet Union there has been, and increasingly will be,
flashpoints for conflict.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Let me move on round the globe. In the Gulf War, the scale of
forces provided, and the number of nations providing, showed that the
Middle East remains an area of great strategic importance. Again
there are no lack of scenarios for new difficulties in that region.
Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait -
you can almost perm any two to produce worries for the future,
despite the wonders of the peace process. Internal tensions are also
great in some parts of the region, with the possibility for severe
changes to the balance of power. The oil fields will ensure that the
future of the region is of interest to the West. As we have seen,
Iraq continues to be able to stimulate a military response from the
West. Yet at the same time we have seen an amazing change in the
Israel/ Palestine question.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Moving further East, the Indian subcontinent continues to flare up
with both internal unrest and external border disputes. Indeed, if I
were looking for a particular worry for a major war then the
continuing difficulties between India and its neighbours seem to me
important.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Interest in China as a player on the International scene seems to
have waned. Yet the indications are that in the not so long term, it
could be a very significant player on the world scene. Its economic
growth continues unabated. Next time you are in a department store,
have a look at the electric toasters - lots of familiar brand names,
but all with Made in China as country of origin. An economically
successful China, with a massive army and nuclear weapons will
presumably be an influence on strategic thinking in the future.
Already we see it beginning to flex its control of the local seas. As
power projection capability increases, we may have to take more
notice. Defence expenditure and modernisation is impressive.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>While in the Orient, the future impact of Japan's position on the
international scene is also important. It may continue to be broadly
neutral in terms of European security interests. There are of course
other directions both positive and negative, which given its economic
strength may affect our future world. If relations with the US were
to deteriorate to the extent that the US removed its security
guarantee, Japan might have to take a more prominent role in the
security of the region.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Korea continues to be an area of concern. North Korea has been
working hard to gain weapons of mass destruction, and despite the
current progress, could become a flashpoint once again.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Moving South, let me wring my hands over Africa first. The four
horsemen of the apocalypse seem to have decided that Africa is a
great place to stay. The famine, disease and war are all
inter-related. The West response is primarily humanitarian in its
most limited sense. Yet there are also great signs of hope. South
Africa has again confounded the pessimists, and the spirit of
reconciliation is real. Mozambique is holding elections now and
Frelimo and Renamo working together. Yet there is still the problems
of Angola and Rwanda.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In North Africa, and closer to home there are great problems
bubbling - particularly in Algeria. The Economist 1995 review picked
Casablanca to Cairo as the trouble spot of the year.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>South America has made a great move to democracy in recent years
with a move away from military dictatorships, and regaining control
of economies. There and in Central America, the Drug trade is an
important security factor for the future.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Before completing the rapid spin round the Globe, let me just
hover for a moment over North America. Developments in security
policy in the United States affect our security interests very
directly. Europe continues to benefit greatly from the US
contribution to its defence needs. It benefits not just through NATO,
but also through the provision of the expensive parts of armed forces
for operations elsewhere. Some on both sides of the Atlantic would
argue that this is not healthy for Europe, and in any event is not a
safe long term planning assumption. Certainly Europe's actions today
will influence the US approach to European security in the future.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>And so we return to the United Kingdom. An island of tranquillity
in a turbulent world? Well we have had Northern Ireland absorbing our
security concerns until the recent cease-fire. This gives the best
hope of progress that we have seen in a generation. It would however
be a brave man who thought the problems will be solved easily.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>International Responses</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Let me now move my analysis on to what sort of International
response we may expect to all these uncertainties and concerns.</P>

<P>NATO has of course been responding to the changes in the
international scene. I believe it has moved remarkably with new ideas
and the development of relationships with the East through
Partnership for Peace.</P>

<P>There are those who argue for faster change, and even a move away
from NATO, sometimes on the grounds that its days are numbered. This
seems to me to high a risk. The WEU, the CSCE, the NACC and the UN
all have important diplomatic roles to play in security issues. Only
NATO has the military infrastructure, training, forces and procedures
to deploy efficient and usable international armed forces. That said
I would not underrate the strains that the organisation is under in
responding to the new world order and the different perspectives from
either side of the Atlantic and within Europe.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The other major player is of course the United Nations. I say " of
course ", but we do have to make a judgement as to whether the trend
for intervention by the UN will continue and whether the intensity of
such intervention will also increase. I recall suggesting at a NATO
conference five years' ago that we might find ourselves more involved
in UN sponsored operations as the security council recovered from its
cold war born paralysis. The suggestion fell on stony ground. But if
the UN is to take on the world policeman role, it will need a better
handle on the nuts and bolts of military planning.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The role of Europe as an entity in future security work is still
emerging. The questions are various: the implications of Maastricht
on the road to a common security and defence policy; the role of the
WEU; the part that the eastern European states and the neutrals have
to play, and under what umbrella organisation - but time stops me
from going too far down that fascinating avenue.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>UK Position</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>What I need to turn to now is the more narrow question of the
impact that all this may have on the UK's security policy, and hence
defence policy and the provision of military forces. We shall
doubtless discuss whether Britain does more than its fair share on
the world's stage given its economic status. Nor is it for me as a
military officer to comment on such a foreign policy issue. However,
I do have to be concerned about what the Government may wish to use
its forces for in the future, to ensure that we have provided
resources in the right areas. We have a history of playing in the big
league -and while some deplore it and others applaud - the military
planner needs to take a view on whether we will continue as before.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Only two nations are simultaneously members of NATO, the WEU, the
EC, the CSCE and are permanent members of the UN security council:
France and UK. They are also nuclear weapon states and both have
distant interests as legacies of empire. Of those two only the UK is
a full member of the NATO integrated military structure. I make no
judgement as to whether all this is a good thing or not; the
historians among you will enjoy explaining how we could have done it
differently. The fact is that we find ourselves with a leading role
in any and all the organisations that might be expected to do
something about the new world order.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>So we can expect to be asked to make contributions to UN
operations. We also have to maintain a contribution to NATO if we
wish to keep it in being. These are not necessarily separate forces -
but we do need to make sure than we cover the differing tasks. We
also need to retain forces for our direct national interests. These
would include those for the direct protection of our land, sea and
air sovereignty; but also for those tasks that we have to do on our
own.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>But there is a new problem. In the Cold War period, we planned for
World War 3. A war characterised by taking all the forces in being -
all other tasks were of lower priority - and using them once to
continue the battle until finished. In the immediate aftermath of the
collapse of the Soviet threat, we began to think of ways to exploit
the lengthening warning times that we perceived for a re-emerging
threat from the East. This system worked fine for the Gulf, which I
can perhaps characterise as a mini WW3: massive forces, high
intensity but short duration. The signs are that it may not have been
typical. UN operations in the traditional Peacekeeping role have been
small forces of very high calibre, low intensity but prolonged for
years. The former Yugoslavia gives an indication of another model if
the UN moves to Peacemaking: medium scale forces; operating at high
intensity in terms of equipment utilisation and technology, but not
in terms of fighting; and importantly for greatly extended periods.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The reason I focus on this issue is that it has great relevance to
the cost of forces for the new world order. We have an example of
prolonged armed peacekeeping in Northern Ireland. In a regular army
it seems reasonable that the 6 month intensive tours of duty for
soldiers on the ground should not come round too frequently
(particularly if when they are not in NI they are liable for a Gulf,
a Bosnia or whatever). Even it were to be every other 6 months, you
more than double the number of troops you need (remembering that you
have also to train them for NI and their other role). The aim at
present - not realised for all - is to make the interval between
emergency tours 24 months and that generates a multiplier of 5 for
your forces. If you now transfer this analysis to a UN operation
which errs on the side of Peacemaking and has an indefinite life,
parallel concerns arise. For a given size of force, you can send a
large number of troops for a limited period -or a much smaller number
for an indefinite period. Similar concerns affect planning for air
and naval forces, although the training for changes in theatre is
less of a problem.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>Future British defence policy</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>These then are the factors we have to juggle when planning for the
future.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>For our primary defence role - our inescapable obligations we will
provide forces to protect our land, sea and airspace. Not enormous
numbers, but enough to prevent infringement of sovereignty, piracy,
or other illegal acts all at short notice. Air defence and air
surveillance will of course remain a fundamental part of this. We
also have national overseas obligations which are set to continue to
decline, but are still there. The price of these special to UK tasks
is not small, and explains why our percentage of GDP on defence is
above the NATO average.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>For the other two defence roles, NATO and our wider security
interests, we have traditionally scaled our forces on the NATO
ticket, and taken the forces for our wider security interests as a
free good. As NATO and UN actions begin to overlap and to become more
similar in nature, this approach can continue to work. Those forces
that we need for a major NATO conflict should be associated with
longer warning times, and can thus be put at lower readiness, become
more dependent on Reserves, or mothballed. The fire brigade forces -
the rapid reaction elements will be at high readiness for either a
NATO or other operation.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In looking at the third defence role ( pursuit of our wider
interests), my earlier analysis suggests that, like it or not, the
Government will want some reasonable cards with which to play its
hand. Here it is worth remembering that each military capability can
offer a different type of contribution - and at different costs.
Naval Power has great advantages in allowing us to contribute, either
alone or as part of a multinational force, without needing friendly
powers nearby. Forces can be used for monitoring, embargo ops,
intelligence gathering or deterrence. All this can be done without
deep involvement - a naval force can poise for weeks and then if the
situation changes, it can disentangle and sail away. It also has use
for disengaging ground forces if that is necessary. Part of this is
of course Naval air Power. One of the challenges for the future will
be how we stay in this game given the cost of replacing carriers and
their aircraft.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>If we run up a scale of increasing political commitment, air
forces offer a form of escalation. No fly zones are now common
concepts for a somewhat hotter diplomatic situation than embargoes.
Here we use fighters and airborne early warning aircraft to police
the zone. Again we can de-escalate relatively easily, but we need
support somewhere reasonably local if the cost of air to air
refuelling is not to become prohibitive. Another notch up the ladder
comes from the threat to use offensive air power. The threat to bomb
Serbian targets as a coercive measure The threat remains in our
maintenance of Harriers to protect the Kurds in Northern Iraq and
Tornados to protect the Shias in the south. Deployments to deter
troop movements. With all of this tactical reconnaissance remains
vital through air systems.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Finally we come to the real crunch, commitment of troops on the
ground. Whether it is security for humanitarian aid, traditional UN
peacekeeping, peacemaking or forcible return to the status quo ante
(as in the Gulf), troops on the ground are a different order of
magnitude in commitment. They are time consuming to get in and get
set up, they are more difficult to operate on a multinational command
and control basis, and they are ten times more difficult to withdraw.
For all those reasons, it is a real sign of a Government's
seriousness of purpose when the decision to put them in is taken. For
most operations, ground troops will be needed at some stage.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>On current plans the UK defence forces are structured pretty well
to offer these choices to the Government. What they cannot do is
produce large scale ground forces on operations for indefinite
periods.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>This approach seems to have worked well. There is of course a
great temptation to assume that whatever operation we are currently
engaged in, that is the model for the future; and that we should
therefore optimise our forces accordingly. Thus the Gulf War was seen
by some as the indicator for much greater investment in air
superiority and precision offensive air assets at the expense of
ground and naval forces. Others were quick to use it as the
justification for an expansion in tanks. Humanitarian operations for
the Kurds have given air transport, both fixed wing and helicopters,
a boost. Multinational embargo operations in the Adriatic remind us
of how useful our surface fleet can be in bringing diplomatic
pressure to bear. UN operations in Bosnia show that the experience in
Northern Ireland pays dividends in UN ground force operations.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I could go on. My message is that we have a range of military
capabilities that allow the UK to choose its response to an
international problem in a very selective way. There are alternative
models. We could draw in our horns and abandon the rest of the world,
but we would still spend a sizeable amount on our inescapable
national security tasks. We could maintain our current level of
resources but concentrate on one capability at the expense of others.
We might then find that we had nothing usable to offer for the next
crisis. Or we could provide more resources to give more endurance to
our capabilities.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Inevitably, what we will actually do is more fuzzy than these
stark alternatives suggest. As far as air power goes, we can expect
to continue to have a need to meet humanitarian aid missions. Whether
it is following natural or man-made disaster the use of air transport
both fixed wing and rotary is key. Here the UK has been at the
forefront, and has announced two key programmes recently - the
purchase of C130J and the new mixed support helicopter fleet,
doubling the helicopter lift of the British forces.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Whenever an operation is to be mounted, be it land sea or air, in
a less than benign environment, the first interest that a commander
will have is in his own air defence. Again we are well set in this
field with Eurofighter coming in to replace the Tornado F3 which has
been doing such stirling work patrolling the Bosnian air exclusion
zone. Reconnaissance and information will be the commander's next
priority. Here the Sentry AEW aircraft give the most modern air
reconnaissance picture, and all the fast jet force can contribute -
but in particular for the more hostile environment the Tornado. For
maritime reconnaissance, the Nimrod continues to do great service -
as it is with the maritime exclusion zone, but it will need replacing
or refurbishing in the not too distant future. Doubtless the size of
force needed will be a question when that decision has to be made.
The naval EH101, the Merlin, will be coming into service, and for
shorter range maritime surveillance we shall have a new capability.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Moving along the spectrum of conflict - or the Air Power pendulum
as I see Tony Mason characterises it in his new book - the Gulf War
has reminded us that hot wars remain a worry. Here we need to add the
offensive dimension: air power remains the key to this whether it is
deep with the Tornado or tactical with the attack helicopter. Again
we expect to bring into service a new attack helicopter, and we will
update all our Tornado interdictor aircraft, and of course we have
just taken delivery of a complete fleet of new Harriers, and the
number of these is being increased. This puts the platform capability
in good shape for some time. The challenge will come when we have to
consider the follow on to Tornado. Weapons have been a less happy
story. Harping back to 1982, we were talking about greater stand off
capability then. Only now have we made progress with procuring these
weapons.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>Technology</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>It would be unusual for a speaker looking ahead on that most
technical of military areas, not to make some assertions on the
direction which technology will take us. Those of you who know my
writings will be aware that I am somewhat sceptical about the claims
of the technologists. The first trend line I would identify as the
key to successful technology is the more bang per buck.</P>

<P>Reducing aircraft types</P>

<P>Precision weapons</P>

<P>Cheaper manufacture and upgrade</P>

<P>Simulation</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>Conclusion</B></P>

<P>In conclusion, I have tried to show why I think future governments
in this uncertain world will want to be able to call upon the full
range of air power capabilities. In Britain, the prospects for us
being able to fulfil those requirements are remarkably good given
that equipment which has recently come into service, that which is
firmly in the programme, and that which is currently being examined.
The challenges that I see for the more distant future will be the
maintenance of the two key capabilities of a maritime fixed wing air
capability and the follow on to Tornado in the long range bomber
role.</P>
