<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Most of the discussions both in the EU and
the UN on security matters tend to focus on military capability. Yet,
whatever the inefficiencies of both organisations in managing armed
forces, the real lack of useful capability is in deployable
policemen. When something disastrous happens in the Balkans, in East
Timor, in Sierra Leone or in any of the other humanitarian crises,
the international community is driven to lengthy military
deployments. Air power may have been able to bring Milosevic back to
the negotiating table over Bosnia and then Kosovo. Soldiers may have
been needed to secure the territories after an agreement. However for
the long haul, it is the forces of law and order which are needed.
Soldiers are not well suited to these tasks of investigation,
prosecution and establishment of a belief in the rule of law. They
are also expensive to deploy for long periods, and the supplying
states soon grow weary of the commitment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">What the UN is desperately short of is a
pool of international policemen to deploy to troubled areas. They
could often be used to prevent failing states from descending into
anarchy. In any peace settlement, they could bring order and train
the local police forces to be fair in their dispensing of justice.
Unfortunately, there has not been any available pool of "spare"
policemen (and police women). They all tend to be fully employed on
their local national duties. This is one initiative that requires
inter-governmental co-operation, which is something the EU is
particularly good at. The reports that EU leaders, during the current
meeting in Portugal, are looking at a 5,000 strong police force for
international tasks is very welcome. The aim is to have the force in
being by 2003, with an ability to deploy 1000 officers at 30 days
notice. What would these policemen do when not deployed? They could
provide training teams, or doubtless even supplement hard pressed
national forces. How would the UK, with its very regionalised police
forces, provide a contribution? Perhaps early retirees from the RUC
have an exciting career opportunity ahead.</FONT></P>
