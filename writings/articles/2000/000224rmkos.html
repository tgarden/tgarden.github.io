<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Political Context</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The Labour Government came to power in the
United Kingdom on 1 May 1997 and had immediately set to work on a
review of what defence capabilities were needed to support its
foreign policy requirements. The review was detailed and the process
was unusually transparent. As a result by the time the outcome of the
review (1) was  published in July 1998, a remarkable national
consensus had been achieved.  The government's foreign policy
priorities were explained by Robin Cook in two major presentations
soon after the election (2).  UK foreign policy would continue to be
governed by a sense of international responsibility in the light of
permanent membership of the UN security council, NATO, the EU and the
Commonwealth. Analysts summed up the new policy as a continuation of
Britain's desire "to punch above its weight", or to have more
influence than its economic ranking might indicate. There was also a
new emphasis on what has come to be known as ethical foreign policy.
Human rights, poverty and international development were brought in
as explicit factors is determining foreign policy interests. </FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The UK's term of presidency of the
European Union from January to July 1998 came  within the first year
of the new Labour government, and much political capital was invested
in it.  However, events militated against the hoped for achievements.
The presidency coincided with the introduction of the new structures
to support European monetary union, from which the UK had excluded
itself in the initial stages.  A  growing crisis over Iraq in
February 1998 should have been an opportunity for the UK government
to show leadership in one area where it had particular expertise. Yet
it proved impossible to develop an EU consensus on the necessary 
action to be taken, and Britain was seen by its EU partners as being
too ready to align itself with the United States. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The strategic defence review reinforced
the importance of NATO and the transatlantic relationship, and had
little to say about the development of a stronger European Security
and Defence Identity. Nevertheless, Tony Blair, the British Prime
Minister, looked for ways to improve relationships with Europe.
France has been the natural, yet at times uneasy, partner  for the UK
in security matters. The two countries have a similar robust approach
to intervention, and a view that their armed forces are able to cope
with a wide variety of military tasks. The St Malo summit (3) in
December 1998 demonstrated that  the UK was prepared to take a
positive approach to developing better European defence co-operation
and capability. This was a significant change in British Foreign
policy. However, later that same month, Operation Desert Fox in Iraq
found Britain operating alone with the United States in a combat air
operation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The Kosovo crisis had been brewing through
1998, and was coming to a head in early 1999 just as the UK
government had completed its plans for a restructuring of the armed
forces to be available for rapid deployment intervention operations.
Much work had been going on in the development of the new NATO
strategic concept which was to be launched at the Washington Summit
in April 1999. The discussions over whether a explicit UN authority
was required for humanitarian intervention operations had been a
major issue in the pre NATO summit work. There was also a growing
sense that the repeated threats of punitive action against Milosevic
over Kosovo were becoming self defeating.  There had been little hope
that the unarmed OSCE monitors would be able to achieve much once
winter was over.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The British government thus approached the
Kosovo crisis with a clear theoretical view of how it would undertake
a humanitarian intervention operation, and a growing feeling that
Europe needed to act more coherently on foreign and security policy
issues. The ethical dimension to foreign policy articulated by the
Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, was entirely in sympathy with the
moralistic view that Tony Blair takes of international affairs. The
unsatisfactory progress at Rambouillet, coupled with the worsening
situation on the ground in Kosovo, made it clear to the UK government
that the need for the use of military force was becoming more and
more likely. The final attempt by Richard Holbrooke on 22 March to
get Milosevic to agree to the Rambouillet terms was seen as the
decision point for NATO.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Tony Blair made this clear in a statement
to the British Parliament in 23 March:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"> </FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">I say this to the
British people: there is a heavy responsibility on a Government, when
putting their armed forces into battle, to justify such action. I
warn that the potential consequences of military action are serious,
both for NATO forces and for the people in the region. Their
suffering cannot be ended overnight. But in my judgment, the
consequences of not acting are more serious still for human life and
for peace in the long term. We must act to save thousands of innocent
men, women and children from humanitarian catastrophe--from death,
barbarism and ethnic cleansing by a brutal dictatorship--and to save
the stability of the Balkan region, where we know chaos can engulf
the whole of the European Union. We have no alternative, therefore,
but to act, and act we will, unless Milosevic even now chooses the
path of peace.  (4)</FONT></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Parliament was, for the main part, very
supportive of the Prime Minister's line, although there were worries
about the capability of the British Forces to take on yet another
task. There was also some discussion about the legitimacy of
intervention. It was on this occasion that the Prime Minister first
ruled out the use of ground forces to fight their way in to
Kosovo:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">Mr. Alex Salmond
(Banff and Buchan): The vast majority of the House is in no doubt as
to who the aggressor is in these circumstances. But I have been
listening carefully to the Prime Minister during the past 15 minutes,
and it is not yet clear to me whether he has ruled out the use of
ground forces if air power fails. I can understand his being
cautious, but is that something that he can do, or does he feel that
he cannot do it under the circumstances? </FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Prime Minister: No, I have made it
clear that we support the use of ground troops in supporting the
agreement. We do not plan to use ground troops in order to fight our
way into Kosovo, for the very reason that I gave earlier. I do not
know whether that is what the hon. Gentleman is suggesting, but it
would take a huge commitment--possibly more than 100,000 ground
troops--and that is why we have said that that is not our plan.
(5)</FONT></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">He reinforced this statement by going on to
say in answer to another question, and dismissed the concept of a UN
protectorate for Kosovo:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">I do not accept
that land troops are necessary to curb repression in Kosovo. Air
strikes properly targeted--directed against the military capability
of the oppressor--can achieve the objective that we set ourselves. 
Secondly, my hon. Friend mentioned the concept of a United Nations
protectorate. There is no notion of establishing a UN protectorate in
the strict legal sense, but obviously the purpose of putting in
ground troops was to back up an agreement--a constitutional
settlement--in Kosovo, and that, of course, is what we still want to
do if it is possible. A precondition, however, is that an agreement
is in place to which not merely the Kosovar Albanians but the Serbs
themselves will agree.  I believe that the action that we have
proposed will be successful.  (6)</FONT></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The final breakdown of the Holbrooke
diplomatic talks led to NATO launching the air campaign on the
evening of 24 March 1999. </FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Military Context</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	While the political context could hardly
have been better for a wholehearted UK participation in the
humanitarian intervention operation, the state of the British
military was less good. The recently completed strategic defence
review was designed around just such a scenario but full
implementation was still some time ahead. In any event, the British
Forces had undergone a series of minor and major restructurings since
the end of the Cold War. These had left them significantly fewer in
number and also heavily committed to a number of different
operations. It had been hoped that the large task in Northern Ireland
would be reducing as the peace process there continued, but the signs
of  a long term settlement were becoming less certain. The air force
and navy remained committed to Iraq operations. British aircraft with
the United States were  continuing the patrolling the North and South
Iraq air exclusion zones, as they had been since the early 90s. Since
Operation Desert Fox in December 1998, these sorties were routinely
fired upon by Iraqi air defences, and UK aircraft were involved in
regular defence suppression attacks. In Bosnia, the UK continued to
provide a significant ground force component, supported by military
air transport. An army of around 100,000 trained men, an air force of
half that number, and an even smaller navy  was finding itself over
committed, and deployed away from its home bases very frequently.
This was compounding the problem of retaining trained
manpower.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	In terms of equipment for the Kosovo
operation, the British forces were reasonably well structured. The
move towards more deployable capability was just what was needed for
Kosovo. However, some of the smart weapons were in limited supply,
and the submarine-launched cruise missiles were only just coming into
service. The UK, waiting for Eurofighter, lacked an agile air defence
fighter apart from the small number of carrier borne Sea Harriers. In
the event, there were more than enough of these provided by other
nations.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Air Campaign</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	NATO planners had ensured that all the
participating air forces were involved on the first night of
operations. For the UK, this was the first operational use of the
newly acquired Tomahawk cruise missiles launched from the submarine
HMS Splendid which was submerged in the Aegean. The number of
missiles fired has not been released, but is likely to be a very
small number given the limited overall stocks and the carrying
capacity of a single submarine. The target was a radar facility near
Pristina airfield in Kosovo. The UK manned aircraft contribution to
the first night was 6 Harrier GR7 aircraft of which four aircraft
each carried a pair of Paveway 2 laser designated 1000lb bombs. The
other two Harriers were used as escort aircraft. This Harrier force
attacked an ammunition storage site, which was used to support the
Ministry of Interior Police near Pristina. However, the first pair of
Harriers missed the target because their bombs lost lock in the smoke
conditions, and the second pair aborted the attack because they
thought their bombs would also lose the laser guidance.(8) It was
thus a somewhat limited contribution in the purely military sense
which the UK made on the first night of the air campaign.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	For the opening stages of the air campaign
the UK forces allocated were 8 Harrier GR7 aircraft based at Gioia
del Colle in Italy, one cruise missile capable submarine in the
Aegean,  two Tristar air to air refuelling aircraft and three E3D
Sentry early warning aircraft. There were some 4500 UK troops in
Macedonia. Weather problems dogged the Harriers in the opening days
of the campaign and they were unable to carry out their missions. On
28 March, the UK announced the deployment of a further 4 Harriers and
another Tristar tanker aircraft. They also announced that 8 Tornado
GR1 bomber aircraft would be prepared for deployment. (9). At the
press briefing that day, General Sir Charles Guthrie, the Chief of
Defence Staff, was asked to confirm that only two bombs had been
successfully dropped so far by UK aircraft. He confirmed this. 
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	As the flood of refugees from Kosovo built
up in early April, the UK used military Hercules to fly out supplies
and tenting for the large numbers of displaced people. The troops,
including the contingent of 4500 from the UK army, were used to
assist in the housing of these refugees. The first use of UK Tornado
bombers was on  4 April 1999 when 6 aircraft launched attacks from
their base in North Western Germany. They needed the air to air
refuelling support of three VC10 tanker aircraft to complete their 7
hour round trips. (10) As the days of the air campaign extended into
weeks, the UK military effort remained largely the same. The Tornados
were redeployed to Corsica  which allowed them to operate without
such a long transit time. HMS Splendid, the only UK cruise missile
equipped submarine was restocked and repositioned, but remained only
an occasional contributor.  There was however one interesting further
military contribution for a limited period during the air campaign:
the aircraft carrier HMS Invincible.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The UK aircraft carrier is one of 3
procured during the Cold War for anti-submarine warfare operations.
Their small size means that they can operate only helicopters and
Harrier short take off and landing type fixed wing aircraft. The 7
Sea Harriers aboard HMS Invincible were FA-2  air defence fighters
provided primarily for protection of the carrier itself. In addition
a destroyer, HMS Newscastle, and a support ship accompanied the
aircraft carrier. The role of this force package was never adequately
explained. In announcing it, Robin Cook, the Foreign Secretary,
said:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">Sending in the
aircraft carrier is a major statement, it is a visible demonstration
of our commitment to completing the job and forcing President
Milosevic to reverse the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo. (11)</FONT></I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">However, NATO was not short of air defence
capability, and by this time was proudly announcing that Milosevic
was left with little in the way of manned air defence fighters. It
appears therefore that the opportunity to divert HMS Illustrious to
the Aegean, as it returned from operations in the Gulf, was taken
more for political reasons than military need. Certainly it provided
a publicly visible contribution at little extra cost, balanced the
presence of the French carrier Foch, and allowed the Royal Navy to
demonstrate the importance of carriers in future equipment
requirements. The subsequent departure of  HMS Illustrious from
operations on 21 May was done with little explanation as to why it
was no longer needed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	At the end of April, the UK forces were
again increased by a further 4 Harrier GR7, 4 Tornado GR1 and another
Tristar tanker. The peak contribution, until the departure of HMS
Illustrious, was some 35 combat aircraft and 13 support aircraft plus
8 Chinook, 6 Puma and 4 Lynx helicopters.   Air Marshal Sir John Day,
the Deputy Chief of the UK Defence Staff (Commitments) said at the
end of the campaign:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000"> NATO has so far
in this campaign flown over 36,000 sorties, of which over 10,000 were
bombing sorties. The British contribution so far has been over 100
air defence sorties by the Sea Harrier FA2s of the Royal Navy, over
1,000 bombing sorties by the Harrier GR7s and the Tornado GR1s of the
Royal Air Force, and over 500 sorties in support by the Royal Air
Force's VC10 and Tristar tankers and the E3D airborne early warning
and control aircraft, not to mention the hundreds of Hercules C130,
VC10 and Tristar sorties operating in the strategic air transport
role with the mobility of land forces being greatly assisted by
Chinook and Puma support helicopters. (12)</FONT></I></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">These figures were further clarified in
George Robertson's departing publication on the crisis.. The 48 UK
military aircraft represented just over 4% of the NATO force at its
peak. Their 1600 sorties are also just over 4% of the total NATO
sorties. However, in the key area of bombing missions, the UK appears
to have been involved in 10% of NATO's attacks compared with 12% for
French bombers. This figure does not tell the whole story. The total
UK munitions released (1011) average just one bomb per sortie and
again represent about 4% of the NATO effort. Most of this was of
course US offensive aircraft.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Diplomatic and Political Activity</FONT>
</H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	If the UK military contribution was
modest, and may appear even more modest once the bombing survey
results are published, the UK diplomatic and political effort was
heralded as of great significance. From the start the UK Government
saw itself in a leading role in Europe, in NATO and in the UN. The 
day after the Holbrooke negotiations finally broke down, the British
Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, explained to Parliament  how the UK
was at the front in trying to find a peaceful settlement:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">No nation has
done more to seek a peaceful settlement for Kosovo than Britain. It
was Britain that convened and chaired the Heathrow meeting of the
Contact Group which  sent Dick Holbrooke last October with a mandate
to negotiate a cease-fire. It was Britain which then made a leading
contribution to the verification mission to police the supposed
cease-fire. It was Britain and France that jointly chaired the peace
talks at  Rambouillet and in Paris.  (7)</FONT></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Once the air campaign started, the British
(rightly or wrongly) saw themselves as setting the pace among NATO
allies. It was at an early UK Ministry of Defence daily briefing (25
March) that the first suggestions of indictments for War Crimes for
the Serbian leadership were publicly made. The identification of
potential leaders to be indicted again happened in London before
Brussels. As the realisation dawned in Capitals that the air campaign
was not going to bring Milosevic back to the negotiating table in a
matter of days, the British expended much political and diplomatic
effort on keeping the Alliance together. There were also early signs
of contingency planning for an opposed ground operation if it should
become necessary. Tony Blair had come to realise that his early
discounting of a ground option had been a mistake. He went to the
United States ahead of  the Washington summit to celebrate NATO's
50th birthday. He knew that there was great reluctance in the Clinton
Administration to even discuss the possibility of a ground war in
Kosovo. To the surprise of many, and the irritation of some, he
decided to try to appeal to the American people over the heads of
both the Administration and Congress. Speaking in Chicago, he made an
impassioned case for the cause of internationalism in general and the
justice of the war in Kosovo in particular.</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">"We have always
made clear this campaign will take time. We will not have succeeded
until an international force has entered Kosovo and allowed the
refugees to return to their homes. Milosevic will have no veto on the
entry of this international force. Just as I believe there was no
alternative to military action, now it has started I am convinced
there is no alternative to continuing until we succeed."
(13)</FONT></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">This speech, coupled with the pre-Summit
discussions, caused one US newspaper to use the headline "Blair Grabs
Role as Alliance Hawk" (14). The article pointed out that despite
contributing fewer planes to the air campaign than the French, he was
taking the political leadership in the Alliance, and "pushed for NATO
to consider sending ground troops into Kosovo sooner rather than
later." While he made little progress at the NATO summit on gathering
support for a ground option, the British government continued
throughout the campaign to keep the pressure on for developing such
an option. In the event, it was not needed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Ground Operation</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The eventual agreement by the Serb
military and police forces to withdraw came as something of a
surprise within the UK. While, the daily government press briefings
had always talked about the Serb forces being near breaking point,
this had been repeated week after week. There seemed little
conviction within official circles that the results of the air
campaign had caused Milosevic to cave in. The UK view appears to be
that Russian withdrawal of support for Milosevic was a key factor.
The growing talk of mounting a NATO ground offensive, the destruction
of factories coupled with economic sanctions, and the indictment of
war criminals were all seen as additional important pressures to the
air campaign.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Once the NATO bombing was officially
suspended on 10 June 1999, the focus moved rapidly to the NATO ground
force negotiations and entry into Kosovo. For this part of the
operation the UK was able to contribute strongly in terms of both
political and military action. The NATO force had been forming up
under the auspices of the Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps
(ARRC) HQ which is a British led NATO formation. The UK had provided
the largest numbers of troops for KFOR and was able to have 5000 in
Kosovo by 13 June. The Commander of the ARRC was a British 3 star
officer, General Sir Michael Jackson, who was seen as the key
negotiator with the Serbs for the transition process. Reports of
differences between General Jackson and SACEUR, General Wesley Clark,
over the response to the Russian move to Pristina airport, reinforced
a UK public perception that the British were in control.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Yet the realities of the small size of UK
defence forces soon became evident. On 6 July, the UK Defence
Secretary, George Robertson, announced that a drawdown of British
forces would start. This was well before KFOR had built up to its
full establishment .</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Media &amp; Public Opinion</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Throughout the air campaign, the British
public remained supportive of the NATO action and of the UK
involvement. Although NATO bombing mistakes received considerable
coverage, they had little effect on public opinion. The media
coverage was very extensive. The  news television channels (Sky News,
CNN, BBC News 24 and BBC World) covered the air campaign
continuously.  All four channels brought daily live coverage and
analysis of the UK MOD press briefing, the NATO press briefing and
the Washington briefing. All other major channels carried
comprehensive news and commentary throughout the campaign.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Considerable effort was focused by the UK
government on maintaining interest in their daily media briefing.
Rather than use professional briefers, a Minister from either the
Ministry of Defence or the Foreign Office gave the major address each
day. The Minister was supported by a senior military commander (often
the Chief of Defence Staff). To maintain interest, the content was
varied by such events as live hook ups to  Macedonia and to a joint
session with the French press briefing. The World Wide Web was also
used to make all the briefing transcripts and policy statements
available with translation for Serbian surfers. (15). It was also
claimed that the Prime Minister's press officer provided helpful
advice to NATO on how to handle its media briefings.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Lessons</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	In an EU speech (16) in Brussels after the
crisis, Robin Cook, the British  Foreign Secretary, drew a number of
lessons from Kosovo. He believed that Europe needed to give greater
priority to a Balkans policy, that it needed to think more creatively
about diplomacy, that it needed a capacity for rapid response to
crises and that something must be done about the overall European
defence capability. Certainly, Kosovo has strongly reinforced the
view in the UK that there is a great need for Europe to do better in
defence. The Uk had already started moves towards this at St Malo in
December 1998. The new startegic concept for NATO, announced in April
1999, followed this through and the EU has been working to strenthen
its ability to respond to crises since. This culminated in the
headline goals announced in Helsinki in December 1999.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	There remains something of an absence in
policy about the need for capability to rebuild civil society after
the military operations in such places as Kosovo.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Now that the UK Defence Secretary, George
Robertson, has departed to become the new Secretary General of NATO,
British commentators wait to see what the effect of Kosovo will be on
UK Defence policy. After ten years of cutting defence budgets and the
numbers of the armed forces, the limitations imposed on the British
contribution in Kosovo was very evident to the Prime Minister. It
remains to be seen whether this will result in more resources for
Britain's overstretched military.</FONT></P>
