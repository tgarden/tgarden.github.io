<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>1.	This second military doctrine seminar is a living illustration
of how the world security order has changed over the past two years.
We as military men are having to come to terms with much less certain
requirements. Our governments continue to need defence forces to
provide assurance that the nation can enjoy the benefits of
continuing peace, security and stability. As the tensions of the
potential confrontation between the two superpowers and their
military allies have evaporated, we look forward to the benefits of
drawing down our military structures. Yet the world is at the same
time becoming in some ways a more uncertain place. The economic
interdependence of nations, the wider security concerns of CSCE and
the UN, all mean that instability beyond our territory cannot be
ignored. The extraordinary changes in Europe have also brought their
own strains, and it would be a brave man who said that the future
path in Europe will be without its own dangers.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>2.	We have therefore the problem of managing legitimate security
interests against a backdrop of potential instabilities, large
military capability to be disposed of, and declining in-place forces
to police the transition. It is against this background, and the
recent practical example in the Gulf War, that the important role
which air power has to play has become more widely recognised. In
this presentation, I will develop this thinking from a UK perspective
and indicate what it means to our future air force structure and
concepts.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>3.	The leaner force structures resulting from arms control
agreements and financial constraints mean that the defender will have
fewer troops, more thinly spread and at reduced readiness, whereas a
potential attacker will retain ability to concentrate force. The less
predictable threat involves a shift of emphasis from capabilities
needed to defend  against large direct threat to conflict prevention
and crisis management. This will also mean a greater emphasis on
international co-operation as of course we saw so vividly in the
Gulf.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Key Characteristics of Air Power</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>4.	So we need to look to our future forces in the light of a
requirement to defend against less predictable threats, while
providing a credible response from reduced numbers at lower states of
readiness. Happily air power has the ideal characteristics to solve
the problem.  The byword on every airman's lips is Flexibility . 
Given the appropriate arrangements, air power can cover a wide range
of possible  threats without the need for them to be closely defined
in advance.  These threats can emerge in different places and so the
Mobility, which air power provides to both firepower and ground
forces is a key to crisis management.  The third key characteristic
is that of Responsiveness.  We have seen how rapidly trouble can
flare up around the world with little forewarning. Again the
knowledge that nations can respond quickly and powerfully is in
itself an important factor in bring political pressure to bear for
resolution short of conflict.  </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>5.	Air power provides a more politically acceptable show of force
than insertion of a ground force and can achieve deterrent effect
from outside potential conflict zone. But the maintenance of these
characteristics and capabilities involves relatively high readiness
and hence readily available personnel and equipments in a
war-fighting condition. This is an aspect I shall return to when
looking at training requirements.  </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Air Power in Crisis Management</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>6.	The use of air power as a crisis management tool is not new.
Nor need it be of an overtly military nature. At one end of the
spectrum is the importance of rapid deployment of humanitarian aid
during critical stages following natural disasters. Military aircraft
employed on relief operations can promote stability and security, and
may resolve distress which could lead to conflict before that stage
is ever approached. The examples are many. In recent years we have
been involved in such places as Ethiopia, Mexico, Colombia and
Bangladesh responding to the need for aid following famine,
earthquake, flooding or other natural disaster. The UN operation in
Kurdistan following the Gulf War is an example of the next stage up
in such relief operations. Here some military protection is necessary
as well as the relief of the starving and displaced Kurds. These
operations are met by military air transport, with an appropriate mix
of fixed wing and helicopters.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>7.	Moving along this spectrum of crisis management, the
surveillance possible by air and space military systems can be a key
to stability. Arms control agreements and UN resolutions following
conflict must  be verifiable. Indeed air reconnaissance can provide
both increased confidence in compliance and a deterrent against
non-compliance. In this respect the role of aircraft in CFE
verification and Open Skies is in my view particularly important.
Again, the movement of powerful surveillance capabilities into a
region can be used as a signal of concern about the actions of a
potential aggressor.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>8.	If conflict seems probable, the rapid deployment of air defence
capability will be an early priority. Airmen have always spoken of
the importance of control of the air in any war. The world saw the
meaning of this on its televisions every day of Desert Storm. If
conflict is likely, then resolution will require the ability to
deploy convincing offensive firepower. Again aircraft can provide
such show of resolution at short notice, and if war has broken out
can provide the time for main defence forces to ready themselves and
deploy to theatre.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>9.	Thus at every level from humanitarian aid to the risk of high
intensity conflict, military air power has a key role to play in
providing policy options to governments and alliances.  To provide
these options however requires properly structured, equipped and
trained air forces.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Future Air Power Roles</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>10.	What then are the roles which air forces need to train and
equip for against these new requirements?  Here, I expand the
requirements beyond crisis management to the ability to resolve
conflict, and also the continuing need to contribute to national
security needs. Interestingly, the roles do not change in nature from
the past activities of military aircraft.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>11.	It is clear that for national as well alliance and world
security needs, air defence remains a key role. Each nation will want
to be able to ensure the integrity of its airspace, work within an
alliance to protect the members from aggression, and be able to
deploy air defence cover for any other military capability that is
deployed.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>12.	Even in this new more defensively orientated world order,
offensive air assets will be needed. For deterrence, the risk of
punishment from air attack is an important aspect. The nature of
these offensive capabilities may be changing as more precise
application of military force is demanded - but fortunately
technology is helping us in this respect. If we find ourselves
fighting a war, offensive combat aircraft remain vital to counter the
opposition's air, land and sea forces.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>13.	On the supporting side, reconnaissance will be of increasing
importance to monitor the aggressor's actions and make optimum use of
our own forces.. The large area of potential operations will place
increasing demands on air to air refueling capability. Finally
support at distances from home bases means yet more demands on
logistic support, and hence on transport aircraft and helicopters.
</P>

<P> </P>

<P>14.	Yet we will have to do all this from smaller forces, and
this means that there will be a move towards greater multi-roling of
aircraft. This will give advantages in being able to meet a wider
range of possible contingencies from a limited number of combat
aircraft. It of course has implications for training and for new
aircraft procurement.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Training Implications</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>15.	The greater likelihood of multi-national involvement in
international peace-keeping operations will entail close integration
of air forces.  Of course, we have always trained together in the
past, but we will see a continuing need in the future - and perhaps
with a wider range of nations. This will be important in order to
develop and maintain the capability to integrate, possibly at short
notice, into a  force large enough to demonstrate political resolve
against any threat to peace.  In particular this will mean a
continuing need to develop and exercise common operating and command
&amp; control procedures within Alliances. We saw how valuable the
years of NATO exercises were when it came to the Gulf.	We also need
to continue working hard at interoperability generally.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>16. 	The responsiveness implicit in air reaction forces for use
both within and outside European area demands intense levels of
training, particularly for potential leading elements; but scope for
graduated response overall should permit different levels of training
to be adopted within air forces. There is however the problem that
unless aircrew are kept in practice to a certain minimum level, they
may not be able to respond for a very long time. We will expect to
place greater emphasis on mobility and out-of-area training;
therefore, there is a need to identify, and negotiate facilities in,
areas offering most realistic training opportunities. There is an
increasing problem in keeping areas for such training as populations
become less willing to accept the environmental burden associated
with military flying training. We are fortunate in the United Kingdom
that we still have a good measure of public support for our training
requirements.</P>

<P> </P>

<P>17.	Resource constraints will make it difficult to maintain the
highest readiness capability throughout air force. It may be that we
will need to move more towards a 3-tier structure: high readiness for
crisis management and key defence needs; lower readiness for main
forces;and longer term capability through reserves. However the
overall training requirement is unlikely to diminish significantly
given the greater number of employment options and the move towards
aircrew having to undertake more than one role. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>18.	As we look at the implications for future training needs,
the readiness requirements will be the main driver. Operations, under
the concepts which I covered earlier, will require a high level of
co-ordination between the components of any given deployed package.
Such co-ordination was necessary before in the NATO/Warsaw Pact era,
but could be planned and exercised in detail over years. The change
for the future is the range of possible operations, participants and
aims. Nevertheless, we can make some broad assumptions on the
implications for our training.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>19.	Whatever the nature of the operation, it will require
logistic support by air. Without such support, rapid response cannot
be prolonged. Thus the air transport, strategic, tactical and
helicopter will need to be trained and exercised as currently to
maintain an ability to respond instantly. Similarly, the air to air
refueling force will need to be ready at short notice. We have moved
towards a policy of making our air transport force capable of tanking
so that the division between each of the requirements can be changed
to meet the needs of the day.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>20.	The core of the air rapid reaction force will need to be
able to deploy at short notice. Typically, we would expect to be able
to put a credible force in place around the world ready for combat in
a matter of a very few days. Ideally, it would be helpful if such a
force lived and trained together in peace; and our current
redeployments may give us some opportunity to move in this direction.
It will not be practical to completely collocate all parts of such a
force, and in any event it is unlikely to be used on its own. This
reinforces the importance of regular integrated training between
potential participating national air forces.  We shall continue to
need air weapons ranges to ensure that the expertise across all
weapon systems can be maintained.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>21.	Looking for ways to limit the costs (both financial and
environmental) of this training, we are of course examining
simulation. As yet, simulation can only provided limited help.
Particularly in the very demanding large integrated force with many
complex demands, the simulator is not the answer. Smaller forces will
in any event reduce the overall number of flying hours required, and
we are looking at how best to strike a balance between the competing
training hour requirements.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>22.	We see the development of the military pilot's skills
continuing as in the past. The selection of the most suitable
candidates is the key to reducing training problems. We will continue
to provide the training in basic flying skills, developing them on
more advanced training aircraft and them teaching our aircrew how to
fight in the air.	We will need to adapt training concept to reflect
multi-role participation in force packages, having first developed 
their individual skills.  That multi-role requirement will put
greater demands on the aircrew, and will require them to be
proficient in more flying skills than in the past.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>23.	One particular aspect of flying training which has been
traditionally important to the Royal Air Force has been that of low
flying. Some have read the lessons of the Gulf War as suggesting that
the requirement for training at very low level is no longer needed.
This is not our analysis. In the singular circumstances of </P>

<P>no air launched air defences, coupled with massive suppression of
enemy air defences, the balance of advantage moved away for some
systems from low level. We may not be so fortunate in other
conflicts, and we see low flying training as an important element in
our aircrew training. We hall continue to train routinely at 250 feet
above ground level, with our crews at highest readiness training down
to 100 feet.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>24.	In looking at the way we train, the importance of realistic
large scale exercises will increase. We have valued the opportunity
to take part in NATO exercises in Europe and Flag exercises in North
America. If air power is to be an effective crisis management tool,
such training will be necessary for all nations who wish to make a
significant contribution. The opportunity to train over a particular
nation's territory is of course one way to make a contribution.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Equipment</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>25.	Although money for defence will be reducing, there will be a
continuing need to replace old equipment. This new focus on air power
has some implications for the way we view future equipment. The need
for flexibility in response to unpredictable needs has made the
scenario-dependant weapon system neither sensible nor affordable. Our
aircraft need to be able to change to meet the circumstances. We are
fortunate that the Tornado  can be used for offensive counter air,
battlefield air interdiction, close air support, suppression of enemy
air defences, ant-surface ship operations, reconnaissance,
sub-strategic missions and air defence. Our next generation fighter,
the European fighter aircraft, will again be multi-roled. I have
already spoken of the ability to switch between transport and
tanking. We will continue to move in this direction. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>26.	Perhaps the area that needs more attention will be that of
weapons themselves. We are seeing a need for many operations for
greater precision and greater penetration. There is also great
logistic advantage to be had from greater commonality of weapons
between co-operating air forces. At the same time there are now
greater worries with proliferation of modern weapons, that we need to
have the counter to what have been traditionally regarded as friendly
weapon systems.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Conclusion</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>27.	The new world order is bringing with new risks of
instability both within Europe and beyond. Air power is singularly
well suited to help manage crises, deter conflict and police
agreements. However to provide an air power capability capable of
doing this will mean maintaining air forces across the breadth of
roles, albeit at lower force levels and reduced states of readiness.
The need to train aircrew will remain, and their are financial and
environmental challenges to meet. The UK sees a continuing need to
provide a broad range of air power capabilities for national security
reasons as well as a significant contribution to security and
peacekeeping in Europe and beyond. The capability of its air force,
its provision of realistic flying training over its territory and its
plans for future aircraft and air systems indicate the importance the
United Kingdom attaches to air power in the modern world. </P>
