<H3><CENTER>An Ethical Foreign Policy &amp; East Timor</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER>by Sir Timothy Garden - 7 September 1999</CENTER></P>

<P>As murderous militias rage unchecked in East Timor after its
overwhelming vote for independence, the international community is
once again searching for a way to bring order to a troubled region.
The Kosovo operation has been heralded as a significant watershed in
international law. Human Rights are overtaking national sovereignty
as the key determinant for action. The decision to establish an
International Criminal Court has, despite the non-participation of
the United States, put another marker down in terms of the
accountability of national leaders in the field of human rights. The
General Pinochet case indicated that the liberal democracies are
serious about their responsibilities to prevent crimes against
humanity. The slow process of the war crimes tribunal for Bosnia is 
showing that it has teeth, and there is a determination to bring war
criminals to justice over crimes in Kosovo. The UK Labour government
has made human rights a central plank of its foreign policy. </P>

<P>Yet despite all this progress, East Timor is highlighting the
limits of international law in the field of human rights. On an
objective basis, East Timor is a stronger case for intervention by
the international community than was Kosovo. Not only was the
original occupation of East Timor by the Indonesians illegal, the
recent referendum had shown that the population is overwhelmingly in
support of independence. The acts of barbarism by the
anti-independence militias were graphically  reported by the world's
media and by UN officials in place. There could hardly be a clearer
case for the new world order to operate. In this ideal world, the UN
would bring to bear a rapid deployment massive military force to
reestablish law and order and allow a peaceful transition to
independence. However, in the real world, the UN has no such force,
and its members no inclincation to become involved in a war. The
allocation of 10,000 or so  troops, which each of France and the UK
have declared available to the UN, are already fully committed to the
Balkans. In any event, it requires months (even with rapid reaction
forces) to mount an amphibious intervention into a hostile land. Only
the US has such a capability, and after its reluctance in Kosovo,
there is little hope of greater political will for a messy operation
in Indonesia. Hence the oft stated need for UN forces only to go in
at the invitation of the Indonesian Government.</P>

<P>What can the Indonesian government do? A military takeover seemed
on the cards at the time of the Asian markets crisis two years ago.
With a presidential election campaign underway in Indonesia, there is
still the possibility of the military deciding to take over the reins
of power. The Indonesian economy is in poor shape despite the$US43
billion bail out by the IMF, and they are seeking another $US70
billion. The UN can try to apply leverage by holding back financial
support, but this will only accelerate unrest, and make a military
takeover more probable. Nor is it clear that the military are all on
the same side. Indonesia has a population of 200 million people, a
fragile economy and a very fragile civilian government. Most options
for outside intervention are likely to make things even worse. Yet it
would be a great step backwards if the international community,
flushed by success over Kosovo, were to turn away from the suffering
in East Timor. Certainly all military support to Indonesia should
cease immediately, and the UN could establish an arms embargo. The UN
should also establish a war crimes tribunal for East Timor, with the
promise that crimes against humanity will be punished at some time in
the future. Every form of intelligence should be used to keep what is
happening in East Timor on the front pages of the world's newspapers.
International pressure for justice must be unremitting. The strategy
must be to make the Indonesian military realise that their future
depends on bringing the rule of law back to East Timor.back to East
Timor.</P>
