			<p><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">It is not only wars that are getting faster; expert analysis is also appearing in ever shorter timescales. Anthony Cordesman has brought together virtually all the known data and official commentary on the 2003 war in Iraq, and produced a useful, relevant and up to date sourcebook in a remarkably short time. The content draws on material as late as July 2003, and his deductions are proving more relevant day by day. First, he looks at the straight facts about the war giving orders of battle and a diary of events. This is a useful compilation, and where there are differences between sources, he alerts the reader. As he reminds us, there has been little done yet in terms of battle damage assessment, and we will probably never get the level of detail which was available after the 1991 Gulf War.  He next turns to the debates about the war plan and the technological transformation of the US military. He concludes rightly there is still a long way to go before the new US vision of warfare comes to pass, but that some of the new concepts appear well founded. <br>
					<br>
					The middle section of the book is a full analysis of the contribution made by each element in the battle fielded either by the US, UK, Australian coalition or by the Iraqis. In trying to read the lessons of the battle, Cordesman identifies the problem that sometimes Iraq's action are just impossible to understand. He remarks that a major asymmetry was that &quot;the coalition had highly effective leadership and that Iraq was led by a military jackass&quot;. <br>
					<br>
					The book would have been an excellent summary of the war if it had ended at this stage, but there is better yet to come. The last three chapters are the most important of all and look at the post conflict phase, and the lessons to be drawn in terms of both the military and for grand strategy in the region. While he has been broadly complimentary about the coalition conduct of war between 18 March and 21 April, he is fierce in his criticisms of the subsequent mismanagement. He rightly points out that the massive looting, which followed the end of major warfighting, caused more civil and economic damage than the war itself. It also allowed the situation to get out of control from the start. <br>
					<br>
					He list in page after page some 38 major failures at the strategic and tactical level in the conflict termination phase. He reminds the reader that things were not in bad shape at the end of the war: infrastructure had been preserved, a humanitarian disaster failed to materialise, the Iraqi forces had not remained loyal to Saddam, and the Kurds in the north had not become another problem. Yet mismanagement and poor planning has turned a potential success into a messy chaotic situation. The list of policy failures, which he must have written in the Summer, appear to be still relevant at the end of the year. As Cordesman concludes: &quot; These failures did much to create a climate of continuing violence after May 1 and to create the threat of low-intensity and asymmetric warfare.&quot;<br>
					<br>
					His final seven lessons are those of grand strategy rather than military operations. He argues the need to establish a secure environment fast, to focus on state-building, keep in view the long term aim, provide the necessary resources, and work with the international community. Wise words from a wise authority.</font></p>
