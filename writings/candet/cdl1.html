<ADDRESS ALIGN=RIGHT>BERNARD BRODIE in 1946</ADDRESS></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 demonstrated to
the world the unprecedented scale of devastation which could now be
achieved from a single attack. The death and disruption which had
needed vast numbers of aircraft, over a number of hours, using
conventional high explosive bombs, could now be obtained with a
single weapon in an instant. Even this power was soon to be dwarfed
by the theoretically limitless energy of the thermonuclear bomb. The
American strategist, Bernard Brodie, appreciated the - significance
of this development from the earliest days of the atomic age. He
could visualise no effective defence against such weapons and so
nuclear deterrence could be the only practical future strategy.</P>

<P>The decision to go to war is an act of choice by a state. The
choice may be made for offensive purposes, in order to gain some
advantage; or it may be for defensive reasons, in order to protect
some vital interest from an aggressor. In either event, the decision
to go to war has been based on an assessment, which is not
necessarily correct, that there is more to be gained, or less to be
lost, by going to war rather than refraining from war. The essence of
deterrence is the ability to convince a state, which has it in mind
to go to war with you, that no such advantageous profit and loss
assessment is possible. To achieve this happy position, a number of
conditions must be met:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><OL>
   <LI TYPE="i">Capability. The deterring state must have the
   capability to ensure that the potential enemy will profit less by
   going to war than by refraining from war.
   
   <LI>Will. The deterring state must have the will to use its
   capability if necessary.
   
   <LI>Credibility. The potential enemy must know of, and believe in,
   both (i) and (ii).
   
   <LI>iv Rationality. Each side must be sufficiently rational to
   base its conduct on an understanding of (i) to (iii).
</OL></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>By examining each of these four conditions in detail, the various
threads and paradoxes of deterrent theory emerge.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3><CENTER>THE CAPABILITY TO DETER</CENTER></H3>

<P>What capability is necessary to ensure that no potential enemy can
make the wrong deduction about his inevitable losses, should he go to
war? Many had expected that the conventional 1 strategic bombing,
which was to come in World War II, would cause unacceptable
devastation. In the event, the damage was not a decisive factor and
the capability was not a deterrent. Brodie maintained that nuclear
weapons are different because; of the lack of warning time, the
instantaneous destruction, the uselessness of shelters and the
additional casualties from the delayed effects.2 The United States
Senate Committee on Foreign Relations commissioned a report, which
was published in 1980, into the effects of a nuclear war. The report
examines, as objectively as possible, the various outcomes of a range
of conflicts in which nuclear weapons are used. The stark summary of
the effects on either of the superpowers of a large scale attack
shows the quite different deterrent capability of nuclear weapons
from high explosive:</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><ADDRESS><CENTER>Summary of Effects</CENTER></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS>Case 4: Attack on range of military and economic targets
using large fraction of existing arsenal.</ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS>Main causes of civilian damage: Blast and fallout;
subsequent economic disruption; possible lack of resources to support
surviving population or economic recovery. Possible breakdown of
social order. Possible incapacitating psychological trauma.
</ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS>Immediate Deaths: 20,000,000 -160,000,000</ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS>Middle-term effects: Enormous economic destruction and
disruption. If immediate deaths are in the low range, more tens of
millions may die subsequently because the economy is unable to
support them. Major question whether economic viability can be
restored - key variables may be those of political and economic
organisation. Unpredictable psychological effects.</ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS>Long-term effects: Cancer deaths and genetic damage in the
millions; relatively insignificant in the attacked areas, but quite
significant~cant elsewhere in the world. Possibility of ecological
damage.(3)</ADDRESS></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>This summary describes what amounts to the destruction of the
state. Indeed, elsewhere it explores the economic problems following
an attack and points to the possibility that 'the future of
civilisation in the nations attacked would be in doubt'.(4) Other
research has suggested that the use of between 500 and 2000 nuclear
warheads could trigger a climatic catastrophe, which would carry with
it the risk of the extinction of the human race.(5) In the early days
of deterrence theory, attempts were made to quantify levels of
assured destruction necessary to deter; modern nuclear arsenals leave
little room for doubt that these levels have been achieved.</P>

<P>Nuclear weapons can therefore provide a level of destruction
which, by any criteria, will leave a state worse off if it suffers a
nuclear attack than if it takes a course of action which will not
result in such an attack. One such course is to be deterred, the
other is to prevent the nuclear attack from happening by destroying
the opponent's capability. Thus to preserve a deterrent capability, a
state must be able to deliver its weapons under all possible
circumstances. Much concern has been expressed by the theorists over
the possibility of preventative or preemptive attacks in which the
deterring state is deprived of its retaliatory capability. A
threatened state could reduce its risk of unacceptable damage by
making the first strike against the other state's nuclear forces: a
counter-force strike. As the French strategist, General Beaufre,
said:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><ADDRESS>The conclusion was therefore that capacity for
riposte was the key to nuclear deterrence, whereas capability to
reduce the riposte was the key to nuclear initiative.(6)</ADDRESS>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>What is necessary is the ability to absorb a first strike, and yet
still retain the capability to return a sufficiently devastating
attack against all that the enemy values: a counter-value strike.
There is general agreement that the invulnerable second strike
capability against the counter-value targets (which in practice would
be cities) underpins any deterrent posture.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3><CENTER>THE POLITICAL WILL</CENTER></H3>

<P>If the political will to use the nuclear weapon capability does
not exist, then deterrence can only be achieved through bluff. As
Herman Kahn explained:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><ADDRESS>If we are only pretending that we would do it,
the credibility and therefore the deterrent value of our force is i
almost certain to be lessened by the automatic and : inevitable
leaks.(7)</ADDRESS></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The question of credibility will be discussed later, but the
factors which affect the real determination to use nuclear weapons
<I>in extremis</I> are now considered.</P>

<P>Deterrence of a non-nuclear state by a nuclear weapon state ought
to be straightforward. There should be no doubt that the nuclear
state can devastate its non-nuclear opponent, while remaining
unscathed itself. It is by no means clear, however, that any nuclear
state, with the possible exception of Israel, has the will to use its
nuclear weapons against a non-nuclear enemy. Leaving aside the
examples of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, each time that the opportunity to
use nuclear weapons has arisen, the nuclear state has limited itself
to the use of conventional weapons only; even at the price of
accepting limited defeat. It appears that the political will is
lacking for practical, political and ethical reasons.</P>

<P>Brodie suggested a number of different reasons why nuclear weapons
were not used in the Korean War.(8) The limited American stockpile
was kept in reserve for Europe; the weapons were considered
inappropriate for tactical targets; there was political pressure from
the United Nations allies; the Soviets might use their bomb; there
were distasteful racial implications in using atomic weapons first
against the Japanese, and then against the Koreans and Chinese.
Thomas Schelling, in 1960, highlighted the importance of a tradition
of the non-use of nuclear weapons.(9) By making a 'tacit bargain'
through the continued non-use, then the expectation grows that all
crises will be solved without recourse to nuclear weapons, and
stability is enhanced. Whether this restraint has been the conscious
- establishing of a tradition, moral repugnance or fear of other
super- power involvement, the taboo has grown. It appears unlikely,
unless the survival of a country was at stake - as could be the case
in Israel - that nuclear weapons will be used against an enemy armed
only with conventional weapons.</P>

<P>The political will to use nuclear weapons against another
nuclear-armed state raises many of the fundamental questions of
nuclear deterrence. Once each of two opposing states has invulnerable
retaliatory forces, deterrence is mutual. The question- then is
whether, given the retaliatory power of the opponent- , a state would
ever have the will to use its weapons. Herman Kahn explored the
consequences of a nuclear exchange in the 1960s, and considered that
measures could be taken to limit the damage expected sufficiently to
reinforce the will to use nuclear weapons. His view that civil
defence measures, air defence improvements and targeting the enemy's
nuclear weapons on the ground could so limit damage that the
'survivors will not envy the dead (10) has lost credibility in the
light of the growth of nuclear capabilities. Henry Kissinger, writing
three years earlier, could not conceive of a meaningful victory in a
total war, but he was concerned with the effect that this nuclear
stalemate would have on his nation's strategy and diplomacy:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><ADDRESS>The costs of an all-out war are too fearful for
it to be our only response to a challenge. Even if it could be ~won,
we should seek to achieve our objectives at smaller sacrifice.
Strategy can assist policy only by developing a maximum number of
stages between total peace (which may mean surrender) and total war.
It can increase the a willingness of policy-makers to run risks only
if it can demonstrate other means of preventing amputations than the
threat of suicide. (11)</ADDRESS></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>There is a widespread assumption that a government would have the
will to use its nuclear capability in response to an all-out attack
on the homeland. The rationality of this action will be considered
later. This spasm response is the basis of mutual assured destruction
deterrence. The worry that Kissinger was expressing was the need for
appropriate responses to threats at levels beneath that of the
destruction of the homeland. The extending of deterrence to cover a
range of conflicts, including the defence of allies, is a recurring
problem in the writings of strategists. If deterrence works, then a
country will be self-deterred if it has no alternative but all-out
war in any conflict. What is required is a range of options which
will give the politician the chance to combat aggression with the
appropriate level of defence. A conventional attack is met with a
conventional defence; tactical nuclear weapons meet a nuclear
response; limited strategic options of, for example, the destruction
of one city, are returned in kind. The political will to use a
capability to reply in kind is more likely to exist than the
political will to cause a total war for limited objectives.</P>

<P>The range of options can be described as a 'flexible response'
doctrine or a 'nuclear war-fighting' capability, depending on the
view of the writer as to the motives of that state. In either case,
it has a number of attractions to the political, military, scientific
and strategic establishment. It gives the politician a wide range of
options; it allows the military to equip and plan for a wide range of
contingencies; it gives the scientist scope to develop new weapons;
and the strategist can devise scenarios to justify the range of
options. However, if every level of engagement is to be catered for,
the potential cost can become very great. In admitting that military
resources must be finite, the politician must admit also that the
appropriate response available for any given level of aggression may
be inadequate. The option then is to concede or to escalate. A
conventional attack would be met with a conventional response, to the
limits of the defending forces. If the defences do not hold, then
battlefield nuclear weapons would be used to prevent defeat. This
type of escalation scenario envisages a graduated increase in the
level and extent of the battle until one side stops, having realised
that it cannot win. In a symmetrical conflict between nuclear powers,
it is difficult to see how the escalation of violence by one side can
do anything except raise the level of the response. With the
exception of the important tradition of the distinction between
conventional and nuclear weapons, there is no natural stopping place
on the slope to all-out war. Even if such fire breaks could be
tacitly agreed, one study by Desmond Ball (12) gives little prospect
for the practicalities of control of a war, once the nuclear
threshold has been crossed.</P>

<P>If the practicalities of a particular flexible strategy are such
that there is a strong possibility of any response to aggression
leading to a strategic nuclear exchange, then the problem of the
political will has not been solved. This difficulty is particularly
acute in NATO strategy. Any use of nuclear weapons in Europe, at
whatever level, is likely to result in massive devastation to the
country which is the scene of the conflict. The political will might
well exist in the United States to use battlefield nuclear weapons to
stem a possible conventional defeat on European soil, if there were a
strong belief that further escalation would not occur. In Europe, the
attractions of limiting the destruction to the continent itself might
be less strong. Indeed, there would be a desire to shelter under the
greater deterrent threat of the American strategic guarantee. This
would increase the pressure for rapid escalation if the nuclear
threshold were crossed. The problems of the deterrent posture for
Western Europe have given rise to two schools of thought. There are
those who follow General Beaufre (13) Henry Kissinger (14) and Glenn
Snyder (15) and maintain that the tactical nuclear weapons provide
the essential graduated link between the strategic nuclear forces and
the conventional forces. The expectation that the political will
exists to meet aggression at the conventional level, but is likely to
escalate to the strategic level, couples the strategic deterrent to
all the other possible response levels. Those of the other school -
Richard Garwin,(16) Lord Carver (17) and Fred Ikle,(18) for example -
argue that the strategic deterrent is effective. A strong
conventional force is usable, whereas the prospect of a nuclear
battlefield in Europe would sap the political will of West European
leaders.</P>

<P>While there is some force to both proposals, it is unlikely that
either would make a great deal of difference in practice to the kind
of decision which politicians would have to make in a crisis. While
two of the European NATO powers - Britain and France - have their own
deterrent forces, it would seem likely that at least one nuclear
power would be prepared to honour its guarantees, and this aspect is
discussed further when credibility is considered. The argument that
conventional forces need to be increased to raise the nuclear
threshold, and thus enhance deterrence, is valid only if it dissuades
the opposition from adventurism. Conventional forces as a deterrent
have had little success in the past, and if an increase in them
signifies a reluctance to use nuclear weapons, then this may reduce
the overall deterrent effect.</P>

<P>If the stark alternatives of suicide or surrender sap the
political will, and the graduated devastation of the countries where
the battle is fought is also politically controversial, the third
strategy to consider is that of limited strategic options. In this
case, the response to an act of aggression would be to carry out,
either with or without warning, limited strategic strikes. The
strikes could be on selected military, industrial or urban targets.
If the action, plus the threat of further strikes, is sufficient to
cause the adversary to withdraw, then this is a powerful form of
deterrence. Escalation is, of course, still possible and indeed could
be more likely following even a single strike on an enemy city, but
it can be argued that the war would be more easily controlled than
the fast moving events of the nuclear battlefield. One investigation
in 1962 into the political will to carry through such a policy of
limited strategic war concluded that it did not seem to offer a
viable alternative to the normal counter-force strategy which
existed.(9) However, since then, the technical capability to carry
out accurate strategic attacks has improved considerably with the
advent of better navigation systems, rapid retargeting facilities and
a wide range of warhead yields. It is also entirely likely that the
leaders of any nuclear countries would wish in a crisis to keep close
personal control over the use of nuclear weapons, at least in the
early stages. This would mean that the effective strategy might well
become one of threats for very limited strikes, with deadlines set,
followed by careful execution of the threat. Limited strategic
options appear to be the more likely way nuclear weapons would be
used, whatever the declared strategy or the force structure. In this
case, there is some merit in questio&#176;ning the usefulness of a
tactical nuclear capability if it has an adverse effect on
non-nuclear capability.</P>

<P>In summary, the political will to use the nuclear capability
remains an uncertain area. The political will may be there for a
spasm retaliation to an attack on the homeland. At lesser levels, the
political will is questionable, whatever the force structure, given
the expectation of escalation. In the event of a crisis and the
failure of deterrence, the capability to threaten limited strategic
strikes may serve to offer sufficient prospect of control to
reinforce the political will.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3><CENTER>CREDIBILITY</CENTER></H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The credibility of a particular deterrent posture cannot be
assigned some absolute value. It is a measure of the probability, as
perceived by the potential enemy, that the deterring state has both
the will and the capability to carry out an action which will make
the planned aggression not worth doing. It is interesting to note
that there is an interaction between the perception of capability and
of will. For example, it is entirely credible that a conventionally
armed invasion force would, normally be met with a conventional
defence: the political will is credible. However, the deterrent
effect of this conventional defence posture is reduced if its
capability to stop the invasion is perceived by the invader as low:
the capability is not credible. At the other extreme, to threaten
massive nuclear retaliation in response to a minor incursion may lack
credibility, not through any doubt of the capability to make such an
incursion less than worthwhile but because of a disbelief in the
political will to carry through such a policy. Where two states have
an assured retaliation capability, it will seem especially unlikely
that the defender will risk retribution by taking such heavy handed
action against a small aggression. In general, the harsher the
nuclear response, the more improbable that it will be employed, for
fear that it will draw similar or worse retaliation.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In an attempt to rationalise the mutual perceptions of
probabilities of action, some strategists have reduced the
relationships between states to mathematical models. While no
precision is claimed for the values attributed to specific
probabilities, and to the profit and loss values of different
outcomes, their authors claim that 'to express it in mathematical
terms can provide a useful check on intuitive judgment' (20) The
methodology of game theory could be of value, when examining past
crises, as a way of pointing to factors which merit detailed
analysis. It is of limited application when dealing with the
complexities of the decision-making processes, to produce answers to
future problems which are as yet ill-defined. The Cuban missile
crisis was a rare occasion on which there was some evidence of the
perceived probabilities involved, and where the deductions from game
theory give rather unconvincing results:</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><ADDRESS>President Kennedy said that he thought the
chances of war during the Cuban missile crisis were at least one in
three. If he believed this, he either placed an incredibly high value
on prevailing, or else he did not understand probability-utility
calculus. It is hard to accept the notion that Kennedy thought the
costs of war combined with twice the gains that would accrue if he
won (the payoff for 3 standing J~firm when the odds were two to one
that the Russians would back down) were anything like equal to the
value of losing combined with twice the value of a compromise (the
payoff for backing down with the odds as stated) (21)</ADDRESS>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>As both ignorance and the conscious ignoring of probability-
utility calculus are likely to be continuing features of crisis
management, game theory offers little help in formulating deterrent
strategy for the wide range of possible future~ scenarios. We shall
not consider it further, but return to the subjective approach.</P>

<P>To make a deterrent threat credible, the deterrent state must
signal its potential enemy that there is a significant probability
that the appropriate retribution will be forthcoming. As we have
seen, a convincing readiness to fight a nuclear war at any level can
improve credibility. Measures such as civil defence, air defence and
the complete integration of nuclear arms into battle plans make this
posture more credible. As Kahn (22) pointed out, the deterrent
posture would become completely credible if it could be made to be a
totally automatic form of retaliation. Moves towards this can be made
by adopting 'launch on warning' techniques and delegating nuclear
release authority to the lowest levels. While these measures may
improve credibility, they have two major drawbacks: they make
accidental war more likely; and they give worse outcomes should
deterrence fail. Responsible governments are, rightly, likely to
depend on declared policy, rehearsed in exercises, with authority
retained at the highest level, to give as convincing a posture as
possible.</P>

<P>The credibility of a nuclear response is also increased as the
number of independent nuclear weapon states increases. If more than
one such state is threatened, then a lack of political will in one
place can be compensated for by firmness in another. Multiple centres
of independent decision-making increase the credibility of an
alliance deterrent. The converse situation arises in an alliance when
more than one state must agree before nuclear weapons can be used. In
this case, a lack of will on the part of any of the chain of
decision-making states would affect the response of them all; and
thus the credibility of the deterrent posture of such an arrangement
is reduced. 'Dual-key' nuclear systems may offer reassurance to the
public, but they are not as effective as deterrent forces.</P>

<P>In discussing capability necessary to deter, the necessity for
invulnerable retaliatory forces was highlighted earlier in this
chapter. Not only must these forces be invulnerable but - of greater
importance - the potential enemy must believe that they are. This can
be done by making the problem of their simultaneous preemptive
destruction as difficult as possible. Sheer numbers of systems
compound the problem of their destruction. Different basing systems -
submarine, air-launched- , ground-based, ship-carried, low altitude
transit and ballistic flight - all serve to complicate the attacker's
disabling strike plan, and hence increase the credibility of the
deterrent posture. The multiplication of weapon systems also acts as
an insurance against future technological developments, which might
render a particular basing system too vulnerable to retain
credibility.</P>

<P>The final aspect of credibility is concerned with the potential
aggressor's perception of the defender's areas of vital interest. A
deterrent posture will fail if the potential enemy does not believe
that it applies in a particular crisis. By failing to make an
unambiguous security commitment to South Korea when their troops
withdrew in 1949, the Americans could not expect their deterrent
posture to be as effective as if they had given a guarantee. One
study by George and Smoke (23) concludes that deterrence failed
because the Communists did not believe Korea was an area of vital
interest to the United States. The problem does not end with the
defining and signalling of areas of vital interest. Future
credibility depends on whether these areas are defended when
necessary. A failure to meet an alliance or treaty obligation, or the
appearance of a lack of resolve in one crisis, can reduce the overall
credibility of a deterrent posture for the future.</P>

<P>In summary, credibility deals with mutual perceptions and cannot
be an absolute science. A massive risk needs only to be slightly
credible to deter; a less intimidating threat may by its nature be
more credible, yet not deter as much.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3><CENTER>RATIONALITY AND DETERRENCE</CENTER></H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>For deterrence to operate, a certain level of rationality must be
presumed in the decision-making process of the state which is to be
deterred. At minimum, this needs to be an assumption that the enemy
will refrain from war if he believes that he will lose more, by going
to war, than by refraining from war. It can be argued that the
penalties of nuclear retaliation are so great that a form of
rationality will be necessarily imposed on what may otherwise be a
less than rational government. Professor Waltz has explored the
question of whether, had nuclear weapons been available, Hitler's
behaviour could have been moderated. He concludes that Germany,
either through Hitler or his generals, would have been deterred.24
Even if this speculation were true, it is equally possible to
postulate irrational enemies, nuclear terrorists for example, who
would not be deterred. For those who lack the rationality to
understand the rules of the game, deterrence theory has no answers.
</P>

<P>When mutual deterrence is operating, similar assumptions must be
made about the rationality of both sides. If these assumptions of
rationality are followed through, an interesting paradox emerges.
Kahn made the point, since made by many others:</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><ADDRESS>In most deterrence situations, once deterrence
has failed, it is irrational to carry out the previously made
warnings or threats of retaliation since that action will produce an
absolute or net loss to the retaliator.(25)</ADDRESS></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>If the carrying out of the threat is irrational, and there is an
assumption of rationality, then the threat will not deter, and
deterrence fails. Fortunately, the knot tied by these assumptions of
consistent rationality is not difficult to cut through. Patrick
Morgan summed up the problem as:</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><ADDRESS>The ultimate problem in devising a theory of
deterrence is to simultaneously postulate that officials and
governments are sometimes in some ways conscious and rational, yet
take into account that certain forces work to make their behaviour
unconscious and irrational. (26)</ADDRESS></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Governments cannot be aware of all the possible outcomes of any
decision: they have less than perfect information, intellect and
control; they are subject to conflicting pressures; and their
alternatives may be constrained in different ways at different times.
If deterrence were to fail, there is little prospect that an attacked
nation would act in a purely rational way. Deterrence can operate
because of the entirely rational fear that the &#176;opposition will
act less than rationally, once it has suffered loss. It is
interesting to see how Bernard Brodie modified his views as a result
of the success of nuclear deterrence. In 1959, he wrote:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><ADDRESS>Over the long term a policy of deterrence
threatens to founder on the fact that too few people are sufficiently
rational or sufficiently wise, with respect to either diplomacy or
strategy to make it work.(27)</ADDRESS></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Fourteen years later he said:</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><ADDRESS>It is a curious paradox of our time that one of
the foremost factors making deterrence really work, and work well, is
the lurking fear that in some massive confrontation crisis it might
fail. Under these circumstances one does not tempt fate.(28)
</ADDRESS></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The rationality paradox is solved by the understanding that it is
entirely normal for human beings to act irrationally, especially when
under pressure.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3><CENTER>THE LIMITATIONS OF DETERRENCE THEORY</CENTER></H3>

<P>Deterrence theory has emerged through the work of social
scientists, historians, scientists, military thinkers, politicians
and the followers of many disciplines. It is by no means a cohesive
internally consistent theory which can predict best strategies for
every scenario. Indeed, some deductions are mutually exclusive.
Nevertheless, it can show which factors may be of importance when
attempting to make a deterrent posture more effective.</P>

<P>The examination of the requirements necessary to meet the four
conditions for deterrence showed an edifice built on mutual
perceptions and assessments of risk in an unpredictably rational
world. While theory could point to ways to improve deterrence
posture, the results often made the outcome, if deterrence failed,
less controllable. The realities of the world can make the structure
and strategy of the deterrent force quite different from the ideal.
In Part II, this practical application of nuclear weapons to strategy
is examined.</P>
