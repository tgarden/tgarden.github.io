<P>It is not often that a heavyweight academic tome manages to time
publication with such topicality as Nuclear Wastelands, which
describes itself as a global guide to nuclear weapons production and
its health and environmental effects. The 50th anniversary of the
only use of atomic bombs in conflict was a predictable publishing
link, but the uproar over the latest round of French nuclear testing
makes the book even more interesting. The editors have brought the
daunting amount of material from the Special Commission of
International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War and the
Institute for Energy and Environmental Research together into a
reasonably coherent, if somewhat repetitive, story. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>First we are taken through the production processes involved in
uranium extraction, plutonium production and nuclear weapon
manufacture. The health hazards, some potential and some documented
after past incidents, are covered in great detail. This section
should be required reading for anyone in the nuclear industry, and
will doubtless fascinate any specialist in occupational medicine. For
the strategic studies specialist, the tragic tales of silicosis in 36
Canadian workers out of the 1364 workers at the Elliot Lake uranium
mine are difficult to put in context. Mining of any ores is full of
hazards, and the layman is hard pressed to draw comparisons between
relative risks. Having visited the R&ouml;ssing uranium mine in
Namibia last year, I looked to see what horrors I had missed. The
verdict is less than clear: shortcomings of the past are highlighted,
yet it is also said that R&ouml;ssing had responded to international
criticism by the 1980s. Certainly, the major concern of the workers
last year seemed to be the decline in the market for their product,
and the possible knock-on effect on the various amenities which the
company had provided throughout Namibia.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>It is the second half of the book which will interest the
strategist more.  Nuclear weapon powers, actual and potential, are
examined one by one. Seven categories of such states are identified:
the five declared nuclear powers; the three undeclared nuclear weapon
states of Israel, India and Pakistan; two potential candidates with
current weapon material production in Japan and North Korea; South
Africa as the only ex- nuclear weapon state; 9 or 10 states with
sufficient technical capability to go nuclear if they wish; three
former Soviet Union states with weapons on their territory; and
finally Libya as the sole example of a state seeking to become a
nuclear state by purchasing whatever is necessary. The chapter on the
United Kingdom focuses, unsurprisingly, on the difficulties of
obtaining information on nuclear weapon matters. Looking at the role
of the Defence Select Committee, the authors claim that it has little
power, cannot require civil servants to appear before it, or require
them to provide specific information. I doubt that those who have
been involved with preparing evidence for the Committee would agree
with this view.  The chapter on France gives no help to the searcher
for knowledge about the Pacific testing programme and its effects
beyond a map of the area. The United States, Russia and China nuclear
weapon production industries are listed site by site, and the text
interleaved with the disasters of the past. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Although much sparser in detail, the most interesting part of the
book is the collection of information available on some potential
nuclear proliferators. Yet others, although identified in the opening
chapter on methodology, get little or no mention. The reader wants to
know about Iraq's nuclear programme. Much evidence is in the public
domain, but it hardy has a passing mention. This seems surprising
given that  Iraq showed little concern for environmental health in
the Gulf War, and that at the time a nuclear armed Iraq was not long
away from arriving on the world scene.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>It is a long and winding journey to the final chapter which looks
at the global picture today. The authors admit that deriving any
estimate of the effect world-wide of the last half century of nuclear
weapon manufacture is impossible. They indicate where the risks to
health are higher than average, and they make a series of
recommendations for the post Cold War world. It is the last of these
recommendations which allows the reader to understand what the
authors have set out to prove in the preceding 590 pages. They
recommend that we  "Re-examine the concept of nuclear deterrence in
view of its role in the health and environmental damage that has been
caused in the name of national security and in view of its effect of
promoting nuclear ambitions and arsenals". That is quite an assertion
to make without also looking at whether the world has been healthier
as a result of nuclear deterrence. It is not just 50 years after
Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but also the same half century since the end
of the last World War. Nuclear weapons are difficult and hazardous to
produce, which is why so few states have managed to do so. Yet
nuclear deterrence prevented  conflict between two power blocks which
 had the conventional military capability to affect the health of
many. Certainly the world needs to move towards ever greater safety
of nuclear materials, both military and civil, and the research in
this book will help those who must deal with these difficult
materials. There are other things to be done. The Complete Test Ban
Treaty will be an important step forward. The continuing reductions
in nuclear armouries are important. Nevertheless, nuclear weapons
developed by unfriendly states may pose potential security threats
for some time ahead; and in such circumstances, deterrence will
remain the most effective safeguard.</P>
