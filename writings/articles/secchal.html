Challenges of Tomorrow </FONT></CENTER></H3>

Conference 1998</FONT></CENTER></ADDRESS>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">Background </FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">My aim will be try to give you my view of the
significance of a "Foreign Policy Led Review"; the sort of political
economic and security factors that an Institute like Chatham House is
concerned about for the next 30 years; and to see what the
implications are for the armed forces in the UK in general and the
equipment programme in particular. </FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">Reviews </FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The review process is always about adjusting the
terrible three parameters of commitments, resources and capabilities.
Those years which have dramatic enough changes to be remembered as
defence reviews (Duncan Sandys, Denis Healey, John Nott, Tom King and
Malcolm Rifkind) have made some judgment about which of the three
factors can be changed in some major way. In an ideal world, a
foreign policy led review would determine the commitments which would
allow the defence experts to scale the capabilities necessary and
thus determine the resources needed. This is of course not the way it
happens in reality - nor I would argue should it. The defence expert
must always push for the maximum assurance that an appropriate
capability will be available for any potential future security risk.
It is only the resource constraint that makes it necessary to make
judgements about priorities and risks. For a constant (or constrained
or declining ) amount of money for defence, changes to capabilities
as a result of a changed view of the priority of commitments can only
be achieved through reductions in lower priority areas to fund higher
priority areas. The overall resources will in the end be a political
judgement of the risks and needs of the economy &ntilde; whatever the
ideology of the governing party. So if a foreign policy led review
wants to reorder priorities, it must also accept that less will be
done in some areas in order that more can be done in others. </FONT>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">The World in the next 30 years</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Most defence planning tries to extrapolate the
experience of the recent past. This in military circles is the trap
of planning for the last war instead of the next one. In the
technology area extrapolations are sometimes made of the experience
of the small scale laboratory innovation to assume that it will be
adopted world-wide in a very short time. The trouble with all such
forecasting is that it fails, by definition, to take into account the
unpredictable key events or applications of technology. In
international affairs, we have seen the change in the Middle East
that has resulted from an assassin's bullet which killed Prime
Minister Rabin. The widescale use of integrated circuits has changed
the way that the world operates over the past 30 years. Putting
ourselves back 30 years, we might have expected that nuclear power
would have been providing us with clean cheap energy. Yet Chernobyl
and 3 mile island have changed perspectives. So I start this look at
the future from a position of great humility. All I can do is give
you some possibilities for the way the world will develop. Like all
scenario building this allows us to judge whether a particular future
world is one that we would want. If it is not, then we may have
options to change the future , and some of them may affect defence
planning, and it will not come to pass.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">A Continuing World? </FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The first question to ask is whether we expect
there to be a viable planet for the next 30 years. With the end of
the Cold War, we have reduced the risk of extinguishing life through
a massive strategic nuclear exchange. There are still more than
enough nuclear weapons to put as risk the viability of the planet,
but we have more confidence that they will not be used. To reduce the
risk yet further means that we must continue the arms reductions in
this area. It perhaps also means that military planning will look at
ways to reduce the threat of accidental nuclear use. This is the
question in American jargon of de-alerting, but to us is perhaps an
issue of readiness. As the worry of a nuclear winter have receded we
have seen new global concerns emerge: ozone layer depletion, global
warming, over-fishing, reducing biodiversity, atmospheric pollution,
reduction in fresh water sources, population growth, epidemics. None
of these are likely to threaten the survivability of the species in
the next 30 years, but all of them represent key problems that will
need to be addressed during the period. There is also the random
possibility of a strike by an asteroid or comet, and it may be that
the risk will be seen as significant enough for work to be needed.
Indeed, I have seen one US writer suggesting that it is the sort of
issue that air power strategists should focus on. However for the
purpose of today, I shall be assuming that the world will make it to
2030, and that the population will have risen from the current 6
Billion to perhaps as much as 10 Billion. It is likely by then that
India will have overtaken China to become the most populous state on
earth. </FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">International relations </FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Any plan for the future must consider the
relations between states. There seems to be a growing tendency for
the power of the State to decline. In one direction, many issues need
to be dealt with at the supranational level. Regional groupings form
for economic reasons initially, but develop into political entities.
The debate over a federal Europe is all about the vision of the
economic community transforming into a political entity with its own
foreign and security policy. In other parts of the world parallel
moves are happening, but the others are all at an earlier stage than
the EU. We see NAFTA in North America, Mercosur in South America,
ASEAN in the Asia-Pacific, and so on. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">It is too early to say how these regional
groupings will mature: they appear in some cases to look as though
there are limits to the degree of integration possible at the
supranational level. Yet in 30 years time, it would be surprising if
some had not formed arrangements akin to superstates. One might
envisage a European, an American and an Asian set of such groupings.
They might by then be co-operating or competing. From a defence
planning perspective one needs to make judgements about the future of
the US relationship. At the supranational level, the development of
global organisations will also be important. The United Nations may
be very different. It might have become more effective in its
decision-making, have the power to implement decisions, and be an
effective monitor of international behaviour. Perhaps, more likely,
it will have become less effective as the membership of the security
council is expanded, and decision making becomes more difficult.
Certainly the signs are that the process of changing the membership
may itself be pretty damaging as arguments break out of which nations
should represent particular regions. Many would argue for a future
where the UN could act as the World's policeman with appropriate
forces on hand to enforce international law. I rather doubt that this
will come to pass in the next 30 years.The World Trade Organisation
may however have developed to be a far more important entity in
moderating international behaviour. We are in the early days yet, and
there are plenty of opportunities for it to lose power, particularly
if the US is selective in which rulings it is prepared to accept.
However, given the universal advantage in well regulated trade
arrangements, it may be that WTO is a better horse to back as a
future global coordinator. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">We might in the discussion talk about other ways
of arranging the world's affairs. Will International Law develop into
a more codified arrangement with agreed enforcement methods? If it
does, it is more likely to be by way of national economic
self-interest than by the emergence of a global agreement to an
absolute set of rules for the conduct of governments and individuals.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">If I take a spin around the world, I can only give
a very superficial analysis of the way States and Regions seem to be
moving. We have a perception today that the states of Western Europe,
including the UK, are stable, co-operative, rich and technologically
advanced. We worry about high costs of labour, we enjoy reasonable
growth, with unemployment a problem for many of the countries. We
look to an expansion of this sphere of stability to encompass Central
and eastern Europe. New members of the EU coming on stream within 5
years, and an expectation that that process continues. Problems may
include FRY, Russia and the North African littoral states. </FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">There are of course black scenarios which might
look at today as being the peak of EU development as the strains of
greater integration, and monetary union in particular, lead to a
fracturing of the carefully built consensus. Or that the strains of
taking on new members, without some fundamental reforms of the CAP,
cause the EU to stultify. Or that the great Russian democratic
experiment fails with a fall into complete lawlessness, anarchy or
military coup. Or that the populous poor of North Africa repeat the
Islamic invasion of the past, this time seeking food rather than
conquest. All these are possible, but in my view less likely than a
progressive extension of the EU strengthening security and prosperity
in Europe. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">However, at the Eastern end of the Mediterranean
there is a more intractable problem between Israel and its
neighbouring states. 30 years ago Arab/Israeli wars happened, and it
may be that in 30 years time they remain possible. That the current
peace process was so profoundly affected by the murder of Rabin is an
indication of the difficulty in making predictions for the region.
However until there is a harmonious relationship between an Israel
that feels safe and a viable Palestinian state, it is likely to
remain a future worry. For the remainder of the Middle East, and
perhaps in the Caucasus as well, the availability of oil is likely to
be a factor which is of interest to the rest of the world for another
30 years. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">I do not share with some a fear of Fundamental
Islam as a unifying force which will change the political face of the
globe. The differences within the different factions of Islam are
more than enough to prevent such a single force operating in the next
30 years. Nor do I support the views of Samuel Huntington who has
written of a clash of civilisations. Nevertheless, the hope of a
global view of the definition of individual rights and democracy will
remain difficult to formulate. We remain to an extent prisoners of
the present when thinking of the region. Thus we will worry about
Iran and Iraq, but it may be that over the next 30 years there will
emerge other personalities to worry us. Egypt has a problem with
fundamentalists, which it currently contains, but at the price of
slowing up economic reform. Saudi Arabia is not without its potential
difficulties in such a time span. Nevertheless, the practical man may
take the approach that oil is only of value if you can sell it.
Therefore in the end, the consumer nations have a lever to operate,
as we see them doing today in Iraq. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">But let me move on to the Asia Pacific region.
Here we have two questions to consider: first, and most importantly,
where will China be in 30 years time; and second what of the ASEAN
nations? Again we find ourselves trapped in extrapolations of what is
happening at the moment. We flip-flop from overoptimistic assumptions
of prolonged double digit growth to assuming that the current
correction may be the end of the tiger economies. In 30 years, the
region will be more populous and more developed. it will be consuming
more resources and more power. It may or may not be peaceful, and
China will be a much more significant player in the world. All this
suggests that there is much to be said for engaging China and drawing
it into the global institutions such as the WTO. Japan is more
difficult to assess. It seems to be finding great difficulty in
adapting fast enough to the new global markets. Certainly the
Japanese opinion formers are acutely aware of the need for reform.
Korea still has the possibility to surprise the world, and perhaps
not in a pleasant way. In this look at the future, we can postulate
either a unified Korea or a war devastated peninsular. Either are
possible. Nor is the Indian subcontinent's future assured. There are
good signs with the increase of high technology industry in India,
but it has not got its population problem under control. War with
Pakistan remains possible, but one hopes unlikely particularly given
that it could have a nuclear dimension. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">If we look at Africa, it is difficult to envisage
any rapid answer to the many problems of the continent. The triumph
of the return to democracy in South Africa, and also in Mozambique
and Namibia gives hope for a region of increasing stability and
prosperity in the South. Yet criminality could still undermine that,
and it will be many years before such potential prosperity would
encompass Central Africa. It seems likely that the world will have to
help the Continent throughout the next 30 years. Whether it will
continue to be willing to do so is another question. In South
America, the move away from military dictatorships to democracies has
been a good development over the past few years. There are some
thriving economies with great potential. Yet crime and corruption,
often drug related, remains a significant problem. Environmental
issues are also likely to cause tensions between the developed world
and some South American states. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Most important of all, what is the future for
North America? The world will be very different depending on whether
the US becomes the world's policeman or retreats into regional
isolation. The implications for the sort of investment we should make
in security depends critically on this issue. As I indicated earlier,
while many of the potential problems of today and tomorrow need a
supranational approach, there is also a tendency for power to move
downward from States to individuals. The widening recognition of the
need to protect human rights, the wish for ethnic groups to have self
determination, increasing access to information, increasing education
of women, and the ability of individuals to communicate globally, are
all pointers to a future where States may decline in power, and in
some cases even break up into smaller parts. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">Technology </FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Having set the uncertainties of the future world
as my backdrop, let me t give you some thoughts on technology over
the next 30 years. In doing this I feel even more circumspect than I
do about predicting the state of the world. It is a common perception
that we are in a time of unprecedented rate of technological change.
In some respects this is obviously true, but I think there are some
important caveats to be made. At the end of the last century,
scientists were beginning to think they were within sight of having
an explanation for everything and an end to discovery. Indeed
scientific discovery and technological application to industrial
processes was remarkable then. There is perhaps a need to introduce
the concept of effective technology. Thus we have had heavier than
air flight for just short of a century, jet engines for half that
time. We have developed technology which allows us to fly at
supersonic speeds, but with a few exceptions, most air travel
continues to be at the same high subsonic speed that we have enjoyed
for the past 30 years. If you wish to improve transit times between
London and New York, a better return is achieved by speeding up the
process of getting from the centre of each city to the aircraft
before it takes off. Similarly the car has peaked in its effective
speed. We have just demonstrated that we have the technology for a
supersonic car, but the speed of traffic through cities is declining.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">None of this is to suggest a Luddite view of pure
and applied research. It is more to point to the disparity between
the extrapolation of the laboratory experiment to full scale
production in the sort of societies that we anticipate. I remember
lecturing in the 60s about the exciting possible future applications
for Lasers. While I might talk then about directed energy weapons,
they have been rather slow to be realised, and clever repairs to
detached retinas, which have happened but are hardly an everyday
experience; it never crossed my mind that every home today would have
a laser in its successor to the gramophone or every office one in its
successor to the typewriter. With all those health warnings, what are
the technologies which will affect security over the next 30 years?
Time will not allow me to do more than list them. They include:
materials science, nanotechnology, genetic engineering, medicine,
novel manufacturing techniques, non-lethal warfare, yet more in
communications and computing. The use of space will be a fruitful
area as well. We will cover others doubtless in discussion, but there
are many that we have yet to realise will be significant. I do
however believe that the trend away from defence being in the lead on
R&amp;D towards the greater exploitation of civil technologies will
continue increasingly. We need to concentrate defence research
resources in the few narrow fields where civil research will not
help.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE="+1">The UK Armed Forces</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">So what does this hurried look at possible factors
affecting our security over the next 30 years mean for the UK armed
forces? Nothing suggests a short notice military threat to our
territorial security, although terrorism and international crime
could approach that level under some scenarios. We come down to
choices about our involvement in all the other potential issues of
which I have spoken. It seems likely that successive Governments will
wish to have a capability to take part in international actions.
However, unless as part of a much stronger coalition, a full scale
hot war is difficult to build up as a likely scenario. This means
that plans for the future will need to keep an ability to deploy
force contributions at distances beyond Europe, and maintain them for
significant periods. An ability to operate with partner forces will
be key, and high quality manpower may be of use more often than heavy
firepower. </FONT></P>
