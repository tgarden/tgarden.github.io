			<p>Saddam Hussein's capture was a fantastic coup for the US forces. Taking him alive, uninjured and without firing a shot must be a dead cert for a Hollywood blockbuster. The problem now is what to do with him. The future of Iraq remains uncertain, and the handling of this most important prisoner could help or hinder the road to democracy. For the architect of the 1988 gassing of Kurds  in Halabja, and mass killing of his people elsewhere, there is little doubt that he should be tried for crimes against humanity. His use of chemical weapons against Iranian forces were war crimes. He must be brought to justice. Any trial needs to be public and international. Unfortunately, the pass may already have been sold, and what follows now may turn in to something less than open, and certainly not under international legal arrangements.  It may even give rise to new tensions between the occupying powers and the Iraqis, between the US and Europe, and between all the players in the region.  Another chance for wider world involvement in the future of Iraq is probably about to be lost.<br>
				<br>
				Paul Bremer, the US head of the Coalition Provisional Authority, agreed last week to allow the Iraqi Governing Council to set up its own special tribunal. This tribunal is tasked with investigating the events of the past 35 years, bringing those implicated in war crimes to justice, and sentencing those found guilty with punishments which include the death penalty. Unfortunately, the Council has no democratic legitimacy. Only a month ago, the members of the Council signed a formal agreement with Ambassador Bremer, which laid out the long route to democracy. By February, they have to draw up a quick set of rules to cover  the federal structure of the country, the control of their armed forces, and provisions for human rights. Over March and April there will be selected Iraqis organising groups in each of the 18 regions. These groups then produce a Transitional National Assembly by the end of May. The Assembly produces an interim government by 30 June 2004, and the Coalition Provisional Authority is dissolved. At this stage, Iraq is still being run by a self selected elite, which has a limited life. Their task will be to ensure the full constitutional conference and referendum takes place, and that direct elections take place by the end of 2005. Thus if all goes well, there will at last be a legitimate government of Iraq some 2 years from now.<br>
				<br>
				Despite agreeing to the Iraqi proposal for a tribunal, it is unlikely that the Americans will be in any hurry to hand over Saddam. After two years of interrogating captives from Afghanistan at Guantanamo Bay, they still have not brought any of them to trial. Saddam Hussein is a much richer intelligence source. They will want to tap into all the information that he has accumulated over decades of power. It may also be that certain elements of the US/Iraq relationship during the 1980s might be embarrassing if revealed in open court. There will therefore be some in the US Administration who might prefer that  a Camp Delta style military tribunal, complete with execution facility, welcomes Saddam.<br>
				<br>
				The debate on the death penalty is also going to feature in the coming weeks. Already Senator Joe Liebermann, the Democratic presidential candidate, has said that any arrangements should start from the assumption that the death penalty will be needed. This concept is now familiar to the US public after the Washington sniper trial was moved to Virginia to ensure the accused could face execution. In Iraq there will be little political support for advocates of life imprisonment. Meanwhile the Europeans, including on this occasion the UK government, will not equate the promise of the death penalty with observance of human rights. Sir Jeremy Greenstock, the senior UK diplomat in Iraq, said last night that the UK would not participate if a tribunal were to be authorised to execute those found guilty. <br>
				<br>
				The capture of Saddam is truly a watershed. It is an opportunity for the political process towards democracy to be accelerated. The Iraqi people have had their worst nightmare removed. The desire for revenge is understandable, but is a poor basis for a new country. South Africa has shown that reconciliation gives a sounder foundation. Saddam needs to brought to justice for the litany of crimes he has committed against his people and his neighbours. The two most likely current outcomes will not be seen as justice in the Arab world or in Europe. Either Saddam will become another lost soul in the US military tribunal system, or he will be returned for victor's justice from those he once subjugated. In the first case, the evidence will not be fully revealed. In the second, he is likely to be given a fairly summary hearing before execution. It may be that Iraqis will be unable to keep him safe long enough for even that. <br>
				<br>
				If the Iraqi Governing Council really wants to show that it is serious about changing the nature of Iraq, it now has a golden opportunity, but one I fear it is likely to spurn. It should call on the United Nations Security Council to establish an international tribunal in Iraq to investigate and prosecute those who have committed crimes against humanity, starting with Saddam Hussein. With co-operation from Iran and Kuwait, the war crimes could be included.  It could start immediately, would be recognised throughout the world, and would show that Iraq means to learn from its history. </p>
