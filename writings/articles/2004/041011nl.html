			<h4>European Defence: Creating Consensus and Capability</h4>
			<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Professor The Lord Garden KCB</font>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>Why?</h3>
			<p>Originally 7 years ago it was the problem of declining defence capabilities &#150; defence inflation meant that even level budgets led to decline in capability. In UK, we continued to rationalise and outsource, but our size of forces declined. It seemed logical that we should look to pool or share capabilities across Europe, to reduce overheads, eliminate duplication and improve output.</p>
			<p>But since then, a number of things have made deeper integration of defence capabilities more important. The strategic context has changed twice. Moving from Balkans operations to a post 9/11 world changed our security concerns from peacekeeping to countering international terrorism. This led to a more complex security response being needed. The EU was in many ways better suited than NATO to police work, border control, gripping terrorist financial sources, providing aid to counter the seedbeds of radical Islam, and promoting good governance.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Second we have had the wars first in Afghanistan and then Iraq. These have changed our relationship with the US in ways that I think may be permanent. The US is unlikely to call upon NATO for major offensive action; but it seems to expect NATO to take on the long and difficult task of post conflict stabilisation. Yet Europe seems to have little influence in the US strategy. All of this suggests that it is more urgent for the enlarged Europe to be able to operate all the levers of power that are appropriate to a region of nearly half a billion people, with a GDP as big as the US.</p>
			<p>So for financial practicality, to meet the new security challenges (particularly extreme international terrorism), and because the transatlantic divide has grown too wide, the EU must produce the full range of military and other security capabilities.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>What?</h3>
			<p>What do we need in terms of capabilities? This is perhaps the easiest question to answer. We need small forces that can be deployed rapidly to stop a situation getting worse, or control the crisis until larger forces are available, or rescue our citizens from trouble spots. We may need larger forces to stabilise failing states under UN authorisation at longer notice. We need the capability to defend our interests using force if necessary. In some cases this may be with the US ( through NATO preferably), but in others it may not. We need to be able to train, equip, deploy and sustain such forces over considerable distances &#150; be they in Africa or Asia, or closer to home on the edges of Europe. The 1999 NATO&nbsp; Defence Capabilities Initiative, the Prague Capabilities Commitment, and the Helsinki Headline goal work have told where our shortcomings are.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>How?&nbsp;</h3>
			<p>How do we generate these capabilities &#150; and as importantly how do we generate the political will within Europe to use them? Let me look at the different possibilities and weigh the advantages and disadvantages.</p>

				<li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <b>Increase national defence budgets.</b> Increasing budgets is the usual cry from defence specialists. It is not the answer for a number of reasons. We currently spend across the EU &euro;180 billion or so per year. For this we get a relatively small deployable output. Each of 25 members has to support headquarters, logistics, and training for each of its armed forces. The US can get so much more for each dollar because it has one DOD. Thus small rises in defence spending are wasted when divided across the nations. Of course the other reason for discounting increases in defence budgets is because they are not going to happen in most countries.</font>
				<li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <b>Rationalise Defence procurement.</b> Politicians love to focus on defence procurement as a key issue. Part of the reason for defence equipment being so expensive is political interference. A politically directed European defence industry would not make this better. The subsidised feather-bedded national defence industries would become the even less competitive European entity. What we need if we are serious about reducing equipment costs is to increase competition. Start by taking the EU exemption for defence equipment away. Compete internationally. Make best value for money &#150; coupled with security of supply &#150; the key driver.</font>
				<li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Multinational activities</b>. Many confuse European defence integration with the generation of EU multinational forces. There may be good political arguments for such forces, but they provide no cost benefit in capability. Often they will be less effective than single nation forces of the same size. The key question that should be asked whenever there is a new EU initiative is: how does this reduce the cost of the desired output?</font>
				<li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp; <b>Role specialisation</b>. The idea that particular nations might specialise in some areas, and leave others to cover them elsewhere, has some attractions. The immediate questions are how do you decide which roles to abandon; what happens if the nation providing a key specialisation decides not to play; and how do you stop all the nations getting rid of the same expensive capabilities? Of course some degree of role specialisation is happening as nations find particular roles no longer affordable. The trouble is that these all tend to be in similar areas. If some co-ordination of future plans could be set up within the EU, then this might help &#150; but it will be very difficult to co-ordinate to give coherent capabilities. This is a possible role for the new European Defence Agency.</font>
				<li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <b>Pooling of current capabilities</b>. Pooling of forces that are already in being offers in theory the ability to reduce support and operating costs. The C130, the F16 or Eurofighter could be operated on a pooled basis at much lower costs with common training, maintenance, logistics, basing and upgrading. This only works if you have a truly pooled fleet management. We saw with Tornado that shared training becomes an added expense if nations modify their own fleets in different directions. The difficulty with pooled operations is twofold &#150; one political and one financial. The political one is how you opt out and how you conduct national operations. The problems deepen as the capability being shared becomes more combat related and higher technology. The finance problem is how do you make such arrangements fair. How do you ensure that savings are kept with EU defence rather than going back to national treasuries. You of course need to look fairly soon at a European Defence Budget. This has considerable political difficulties. But common funding and pooling of outsourced support may be a way in to showing the advantages. Why shouldn't Avis Europe bid for an EU wide contract for military support vehicles?</font>
				<li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp; <b>Joint owned &#150; joint operated</b>. To get the big ticket capabilities, which Europe is missing, requires a different form of pooling. Money must be shared to provide joint capabilities &#150; just as NATO does with AWACs &#150; and personnel and support needs to be done at the European level. The money saved by rationalisation through pooling could be recycled to provided the strategic sea and airlift, the ISTAR capabilities, deployable HQs, AAR and other important enablers.</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font>

			<h3>When?</h3>
			<p>Let me finish by mapping out a possible future and indicating where I think we are going in the right direction. In my view we need a vision. Just as monetary union was a vision for many years, so a CFSP underpinned by serious diplomatic, economic, political and military levers is still a long term project. We have done much in the past 6 years to unstick years of obstruction (primarily by the UK). The Helsinki Headline Goal was a start. The evolution of Solana's role, particularly if we can ratify the new Constitution, will be important. Experience in Macedonia, Congo and soon Bosnia will again help. We now have an agreed EU Global Security Strategy, which is an important basis for developing consensus and capabilities. The European Defence Agency and the goal for 2010 offer opportunities to progress.</p>
			<p>But in the end, we still seem to be putting together national forces in different packages, whether it is against HHG requirements or the new smaller Battle Groups for quick response. We must be more adventurous in putting together our limited capabilities in a way that produces much greater effectiveness for the Euro. Pooling capabilities, perhaps initially in the contracted-out support area, must be the way most likely to produce serious rationalisation. This is what the European Defence Agency needs to be directed to encourage rather than act as an industrial restructuring empire. If we could get pooled capabilities, the procurement benefits would flow for successor generations of equipment.</p>
			<p>I am not advocating the European Army next year. However, we can make moves in smaller ways at first. The Netherlands has set a good example with your naval arrangements with Belgium and your air transport co-operation with Germany. Each of those seem to me to offer cost benefits. Bilateral arrangements are easier for accounting purposes. We need to set up a defence budgetary arrangement in the EU, which ensure each nation is paying its fair share in capability or money. Finance ministers need to take a much closer interest in the advantages of EU defence rationalisation. The money saved by merging capabilities needs to feed into the enabling forces that we lack.</p>
			<p>We may never achieve the return that the US can from its defence budget, but we can certainly aim to come a lot closer. When we have a serious range of capabilities to further European interests, we can work with the Americans as we do in the field of trade issues &#150; as equal partners. I believe we have an obligation as Europeans to make this happen.</p>
