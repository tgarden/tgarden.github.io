<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Personal Background</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I remember 20 years as a squadron leader fresh from staff college
at Camberley (joint training is not that new), I found myself talking
to the then DUS(Air) at a party. I explained that  I thought that
there would be a much more efficient management of defence if at the
rank of Colonel or equivalent in the other two services, we all gave
up our affiliation to the Navy, Army or Air Force and became Colonel
Garden (late RAF). Since most broad Whitehall warriors were at this
level or above, they could share a career scheme which meant success
was not seen as winning the resource battle for your service rather
than for defence as a whole. The kindly DUS(Air) explained to me that
I should keep such thoughts to myself if I wished to spend much
longer on the 6th floor as PSO to an AFB member. Yet 20 years on we
have moved enormously towards a more centrally controlled defence
structure. The DUS(Air) post is long forgotten. It would seem absurd
to today's Whitehall warriors that the individual services should
have their own tame 3 star civil servant to fight their cause.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Having spent that interesting period in the 70s seeing how the
service boards operated it was 10 years before I returned to main
building, successively as a group captain in the defence programmes
staff, an air commodore as director of air force staff duties (the
bastion of single service projection), an air vice-marshal assistant
chief of the air staff, and finally back to the power of the centre
as the assistant chief of the defence staff responsible for the
defence programme.  I speak therefore from personal prejudice and
experience as well academic objectivity, if the two can be combined.
There is no doubt in my mind that resources have been wasted over the
year by poor decisions taken on the basis of inter-service horse
trading and turf fights. The question may be whether such
difficulties are solved by the changes that have happened, are
continuing and may happen in the future.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Evolution of MOD</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In the War Office of the Crimea War, it was Florence Nightingale
who observed that the Minister had in his charge: </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>" a very slow office, an enormously expensive office,a not very
efficient office, and one in which the minister's intentions can be
entirely negatived by all his sub-departments, and those of each of
the subdepartments by every other." </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P> This feeling has continued to modern times, although we have had
great changes to attempt to address each of the problems that
Florence Nightingale identified. The 3 Services are only 3 of a
number of lobbying groups within the power struggle of the MOD. In
1871, it was suggested that one way round the obstructionism of the
fiefdoms within the ministry would have been to follow the example of
other countries and install a serving soldier as Secretary of State.
Even in those times, this was not considered seriously. We have the
first key factor in studying how defence is organised in the UK. We
have a very long tradition of democratic civilian political led
policy. All the elements of the MOD are there to provide advice to
elected politicians who take decisions. This is a strength in terms
of democratic accountability, but of course is also a recipe for
generating warring factions trying to gain the ear of the minister.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In 1870, by means of the War Office Act, the responsibilities were
divided into three, in an attempt to have clear lines of
accountability. The Commander -in -Chief was responsible for military
advice, a Surveyor General of Ordnance looked after materiel ( we
shall return to his modern day successor: the Chief of Defence
Logistics), and a civilian Financial Secretary was responsible for
the estimates and accounts. There were some serious equipment
failures in Egypt during the 1884-85 campaign and the special office
for equipment became a casualty. In 1888, the war Office had two
halves - the battle lines were drawn between military and civilian.
Again, the problems of the day will resonate with those who have
worked in the MOD in recent days. A Commission (the Stephen
Commission of 1887) reported that the military side when planning
routinely pitched their demands too high knowing that the civilian
financial side would cut them back. "Extravagance controlled by
stinginess is not likely to result in either economy or efficiency",
they reported. In these days the Treasury also played a role, which
was every bit as unhelpful as has been the case in recent years. At
the turn of the century, a new Chancellor was reported as saying "I
have been rather struck by the uniform and constant attitude of
positive hostility in language taken up by various Officers of the
Treasury towards Naval and Military Officers generally."</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The system worked badly, and as a result of failures in the Boer
war, a Royal commission looked into the organisation, under Lord
Elgin. The result was the creation of the Chief of the General Staff 
post, a mixed military civilian army council chaired by Sof S
-feeding a Committee of Imperial Defence which was chaired by the PM
with the Army and Navy SofS's as members. The age of Defence by
committee had started. There was one aberration. Having eschewed the
control of defence policy and expenditure by the military, in 1914
Lord Kitchener was appointed as Secretary of State for War for the
1st World War.  This was not a happy experience. However the
experience of poor planning in WW1 had a number of beneficial effects
in the development of a Ministry of Defence. Not least of these was
of course the formation of an independent air force - which I am sure
you have already covered. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In the immediate post WW1 era there was pressure for the
establishment of a Minister of Defence, partially seen as having
sufficient clout to stand up to the Treasury. The 10 year rule made
the Treasury very powerful in restraining money to spent on the
military. It was 1936 before the post of Minister for Co-ordination
of Defence was established with Sir Thomas Inskip as the first
incumbent.  It was the period where the Secretary of State for Air
was seen as way in the lead with the bomber programme as the major
user of resources, the Navy coming second and the army way behind.
The Inskip report of 1937 may have changed the priority for spending
from offence to defence, but it still left the RAF in the lead with
the need for air defences. It has even been suggested that
Chamberlain appointed Hore-Belisha to the War Office to weaken its
influence further so that the Inskip policy would work. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>It was only with Churchill's appointment as Prime Minister  in May
1940, that we see a concerted effort to point all the players in the
same direction. Churchill became Minister of Defence and shunted the
individual Service ministers out of the War Cabinet.  Churchill ran
defence planning and resource allocation as a Prime Ministerial task.
Perhaps that is the only way to be able to bang heads together and
get over the problems which Florence Nightingale correctly
identified. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>After the war, this centralised control suffered a set back with
the establishment of the Cabinet Defence Committee which took its
input from the individual Service ministries - the Admiralty, the War
Office and the Air Ministry. Although the Minister of Defence was the
deputy chairman of the committee, the chiefs of staff and the
individual ministers sat on the committee and were thus able to
bypass the Ministry of Defence. The post was not seen as career
enhancing to the up and coming politician.  The individual service
ministers had their own appropriations and were thus each service
went its own way. Defence planning between 1946 and 1952 was chaotic.
The Services competed for defence roles - and this led to compromises
with tri Service recommendations. The transition to the Cold War, and
the difficult economic position of the country made the competition
between the Services all the greater. The Korean War put further
pressure on the system with a sudden requirement for rearmament. Each
service department dealt directly with the Treasury to obtain its
allocation of money.</P>

<P>Suez exposed the weaknesses of the divided organisation both in
terms of planning and execution, and Macmillan charged Duncan Sandys
with sorting it out.</P>

<P>In 1958 Sandys White Paper on Defence organisation sought to
develop an organisational structure which would  make the defence
minister responsible for 'formulation and general application of a
unified policy relating to the Armed Forces and their requirements."
A new post of Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff had been brought in
1956 ( Mountbatten claims that he suggested it to Eden, and this post
now became Chief of the Defence Staff. The individual service chiefs
retained their right of access to the PM and their individual
ministers. This was the time of the Sandys Review and the projected
cutback in manned aircraft for air defences did little to bed the
arrangement down well. Sandys had a remit to cut defence expenditure
and he took little notice of the views of the individual service
chiefs. There was perhaps more unity generated by the common dislike
of Sandys from each of the Services. As a result his proposals were
watered down and progress to a unified central control was slowed.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>It was not until 1963, that a truly unified Ministry of Defence
came into being as a result of the work of Lord Mountbatten who was
the second Chief of Defence Staff (1958 to 1965). Mountbatten argued
that the individual service ministries must be abolished if the
Defence Minister was ever to be able to take control. This made
Thorneycroft the first Secretary of State for Defence, with the
individual service ministers reduced to ministers of state who had to
act through the new S of S. Mountbatten also intended that the
service chiefs would in a parallel way tender their advice through
the CDS. However the battle fought by the service chiefs was
successful and they retained their individual roles and
responsibility for military operations The procurement organisation
was also formed, and the Defence Operational Requirements Staff came
into being in an attempt to get inter-Service agreement about longer
term plans at a level below COS. The new Ministry of Defence meant
that 4 departments of state disappeared (3 services and aviation).
The SofS became responsible for all questions of policy and
administration of the fighting services. He would have 3 principle
advisers, CDS, PUS and CSA. Mountbatten remained concerned about the
disruptive effect of the vestigial remains of the 3 Service
departments and was clear that  "the goal must be a completely
functional organisation". In many ways that is still the guiding
light of the changes we see happening now. The election of October
1964 of a small majority Labour Government  was a mixed blessing in
terms of MOD reform. Denis Healey was a strong Defence Minister but
had resource  problems of an acute nature to manage. The TSR2 crisis,
the 5th Polaris, the TA (yes even then), Aden, reduction in carriers
(resignation of Mayhew) made things difficult. There was a to and fro
between RAF and Navy in a time when the budget was cash limited. (at
&#163;2Bn). Mayhew was against centralisation and felt he had to
resign and speak out. The Geraghty Committee of 1966 produced a plan
for a radical restructuring which would eliminate the single service
boards, and have a Defence Management Board responsible  for
procurement,personnel and logistics. The plan did not find favour and
was not implemented. Healey did bring the three service intelligence
organisations together however.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In 1967 the service ministers were downgraded a further notch, and
two new ministers of state posts for Administration and Equipment
were established, and in 1970 the junior service ministers
disappeared entirely, but were restored the following year by the new
Conservative Government (but with much limited remits). The weakening
of the powerbase within the ministry of the individual service chiefs
has been much slower, but the move from three independent fiefdoms to
a unified central headquarters has continued from 1970, when the
powers of the CDS were increased. In a letter to the Times in 1970
Professor Michael Howard wrote that despite the changes to the MOD "
a glut of uniformed officers were preventing decisions from being
made which might be prejudicial to the interests of their own
service. The secondary debate of the division of power between
military and civilian in the MOD is also an issue which we need to
think about.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The 70s saw little movement in the power struggle between the
single services and the central control advocates. It was a difficult
time with financial crises and to some extent the pressure was so
acute as to cause co-operation against the common enemy of the
Treasury. Labour public sector pay policy was causing enormous
difficulties, and the single service ministers had a useful role to
play. The arrival of Margaret Thatcher in 1979 had a number of
effects on defence. The pay awards of the dying Callaghan government
were accelerated and defence took a higher priority in government
thinking. Nevertheless, Mrs Thatcher was not impressed by the waste
and inefficiency of the MOD. She replaced her first Defence Minister,
Francis Pym, when he did not seem to be sorting out defence to her
satisfaction. John Nott came in charged to shake up the organisation.
His Review looked to change the by now traditional carve up of the
cake between the Services. Keith Speed, the Navy minister was sacked
when he spoke out against cuts to the Navy, and was not replaced. His
was the final death knell of the single service ministers. Mrs
Thatcher implemented a change without an organisational review which
severed the direct link between the Services and the Government, and
also because of one junior minister stepping out of line. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	John Nott was a casualty of the Falklands, but Mrs Thatcher had
put her PPS Clive Whitmore in as PUS in mid 1982, and Michael
Heseltine, who fancied himself as a management expert, arrived as
Defence Secretary. He did not disappoint in his radical approach to
defence management. The Ministry of Defence Organisational Review was
published in 1984. He had grafted on his Management Information for
Ministers System (MINIS) which had been developed while he was at
Environment.   It took little note of the single service
sensitivities and was structured on a broadly functional basis. The
key change was to the responsibilities of CDS and PUS who became
jointly the principal advisers to S of S. CDS was the advisor for
military operations and strategy, while PUS looked after political
and financial policy. The VCDS and 4 DCDS posts, the 2nd PUS with the
Office of Management and Budget, the CSA and the CDP left a rather
small role within the MOD for the individual service chiefs who
boards could provide advice to the centre. The 2nd PUS was a member
of all of the service boards to give that linkage.  The COS kept
proudly their right of access to the Prime Minister.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	As the Cold War was coming to an end, the happy days of growth
in the Defence Budget was also at an end. The 3% real growth through
the first half of the 80s had caused the forward programme to become
unaffordable. At the same time Mrs Thatchers continuing search for a
more efficient Whitehall had put MOD in the spotlight. Peter Levene
had introduced ruthless competitive policies into defence
procurement, the New Management Strategy sort to align financial and
management responsibilities. You suddenly found senior military
officers scrabbling to become budget holders - knowing that the power
went with the budget. The revolution that was taking place also
tackled the support area. The government was intent on privatising
what it did not need to run, and making semi-independent agencies of
activities which did not need direct day to day running from
Whitehall. Contacting out of activities which had previously been
undertaken by servicemen or MOD civilians reduced the number of
defence personnel - and also showed how expensive they were.
Typically savings of 25% were achieved. This hiving off of aspects of
the services did of course have an effect on the nature of the
services. A single firm would happily provide an operation for all 3
services, where each service may have operated its own previously. 
The Defence Evaluation and Research Agency brought together tracts of
land owned by the services with scientists and analysts who could
operate as a defence capability rather than a single service lobby
group.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	A key study during this time was into the number of senior
posts. The constitution of the three Service Boards were such that
they generated a large number of unnecessary 2 star and above
officers. The move to aligning financial and management
responsibility meant that the separation of the C-in-Cs from the
policy making board members was no longer sustainable.  There was
also a need to rationalise headquarters to save money - an also
improve efficiency. The Prospect study made the PAOs and the CinCs of
the logistics arms the same post, and the PPOs and the CinCs of the
personnel &amp; training commands the same person, and bought the
operational commanders on to the service boards. This had the side
effect of moving most of the board members out of London. PE was also
undergoing changes which meant that the the three service controllers
were now downgraded and have subsequently disappeared. Another board
function disappearing from London. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	The next bite of the cherry came with series of quick studies
as part of Malcolm Rifkind's  Front Line First   defence review.
There was very much a theme of joint operations and training
throughout the studies. The study was designed to take the logic of
the new management strategy further. "there was still a gap to be
closed between the principles of Prospect and NMS and current
practice" Prospect had forecast a decrease in MOD London posts from
12,700 in 1990 to 5200 in 1995. Front Line First set a target of 3750
for 1998. The OMB and Defence Staff compartments were to be ended. It
would create "a Head Office composed of a unified Central Staff and
three small headquarters staffs supporting the individual Chiefs of
Staff as heads of their Services. Further responsibilities would be
delegated to Commands".  The FPMG is made clearly the single key
policy forum with the Chiefs of Staff Committee as "the ultimate
source of professional military advice".</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Front line first also announced the decision to form a
permanent Joint Headquarters at Northwood. It seemed at first sight
odd that another operational headquarters should be formed. Up until
then, the appropriate lead Service had provided its HQ for joint
operations (the Navy for the Falklands, the RAF for the Gulf War, the
Army for Bosnia). The original thinking was that this would allow the
move of the Commitments staff out of MOD to the new HQ, but that was
a step to large.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Current Position</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	The SDR has rightly been heralded as a remarkably good piece of
work. It is true that the Labour manifesto commitment to conduct a
review within 6 months of coming into power was little more than a
device to ensure that defence policy could not become an internally
divisive issue. It had in the past been an entirely negative factor
in Labour's chances of being elected. The selection of George
Robertson as Defence Minister changed it from a delaying device to a
genuine attempt to match commitments, resources and capabilities. It
took much longer than the 6 months of the manifesto commitment, but
that was in many ways a good thing as it could be announced at much
the same time as the Treasury led comprehensive spending review. Had
it produced a White Paper in November, there is little doubt that the
MOD position would have been much weaker by the middle of this year
when the CSR was reporting. But that is just a question of the short
term tactics. More importantly to our topic for this morning, the SDR
has taken forward the development of the MOD, and the roles of the
individual single services, in  a number of significant ways.  The
central staffs have gained power again at the expense of the Chiefs.
The most significant change is the establishment of the Chief of
Defence Logistics post. The single services currently run almost
entirely their own logistic operations. There is some sharing of the
less operationally sensitive common requirements, but the big budget
items for each service is within their logistic expenditure. The
current budgets of the three service logistics CinCs are 2, 1 and 1.7
Bn in round numbers - over 20% of the defence budget. Chief of Fleet
Support has twice the budget of CinC Fleet. CinC Strike Command has
just about exactly the same budget as Cin C RAF Logs.  This grouping
of the three service logistics commands into a single central joint
organisation is therefore a massive change in power - since control
of resources is a key element of power. Less anyone think that this
merely a HQ change and that the new CDL will merely be a 4 star
ACDS(L) providing logistics advice to CDS and ministers - the
supporting papers of the SDR merit close study:</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>- the three service logistics organisations will be brought
together into a unified organisation to provide logistic support to
all three Services</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>- a Chief of Defence Logistics (4 star) will be appointed to take
overall control of the current organisations and reconfigure them,
after an appropriate transition period, into one integrated
organisation which will, however, retain the necessary close
relationship with front-line forces.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	On the operational side the SDR also makes changes designed to
reduce the problems of inter-Service squabbles.  An important straw
in the wind for the future is the making of the Chief of Joint
Operations into a Top Level Budget Holder, thus giving him ( I think
it will still be sometime before I need to say "or her") equal status
with the 3 service operational CinCs. The amount (&#163;M300) is
relatively small - 10% of CinC Land - but the significance is great.
Again the supporting papers of the SDR make it clear what is in mind:
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>- Individual units depend for their fighting capability on the
training, discipline and ethos generated by their parent Service. But
success for the force as a whole requires effective orchestration of
its individual components.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>- to achieve this, a single joint commander is needed, supported
by a unified command structure. The joint commander must be able to
draw upon and direct the entire range of front-line forces committed
to the operation, together with supporting units and personnel (both
military and civilian)</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The development of Joint Rapid Reaction Forces also points the way
to the immediately ready forces being under central command, and the
diagram (p8-3) makes it clear that the single services are second
echelon activities.  "The substantial expansion in both the number
and types of forces assigned to our Joint Rapid Reaction Forces, and
hence the number of operations likely to come under the command of
the Permanent Joint Headquarters, has led us to reassess the role of
the Chief of Joint Operations".  All this is of course reinforced by
Joint Force 2000 (Harriers), Joint Defence Centre (Doctrine), Joint
Helicopter Command, Joint Ground Based Air Defence, Joint Nuclear,
Chemical and Biological Defence as well as of course the Joint
Support through CDL. It will not have escaped the RAF members that
their service is perhaps more affected by these joint sharing of
roles than the other two. This is scarcely surprising as air is key
in both land and maritime operations. It does not in my mind mean
that the RAF is disappearing to be shared by the other two Services,
but that the individual Services are losing their separateness, and a
new model for the provision of military capability in an efficient
manner is evolving.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>What does this leave for the individual services to do? As the SDR
makes clear, the role of the single services, and their chiefs, will
be to deliver fighting capability. They will be responsible for
training, discipline and ethos. This is a fairly limited remit
compared with the days of the global strategy review when the single
Service Chiefs produced government and NATO policy.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Future Possibilities</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>So let me turn to what I see as the most likely future
developments. The trend for looking for the best man for the job
rather than buggins turn for rotational appointments will continue.
As more of the key appointments are within the joint organisations
this will spread downwards. This will inevitably bring pressure to
bear on the personnel management areas of the Services. There will be
significant rationalisations possible if the three services
rationalised their personnel organisations. However, this would be a
big step and would bring into question their ability to deliver on
ethos. The likely stages will be the increasing of the power of the
centre - currently represented by DCDS(P&amp;P). This post is a
somewhat unhappy mixture with responsibilities for saving money on
the Programmes side while being generous with it on the Personnel
side. The Betts Report identified the strange situation that the
armed forces, for all their reliance on people, has no one person
with clear single responsibility for what  in business would be
called Human Resources. The strengthening of the Centre at the
expense of the PPOs will lead to the establishment of a CDP with a
similar remit to CDL. This will be fought strongly by the COS,
because in the end the only real power that they retain is that of
patronage.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>This leads me to speculate about the longer term developments in
the COS' role. As the service boards have changed over the past ten
years, they have seen their key advisers disappear from Whitehall.
Whereas the PPOs, PAOs, PE Controllerates were all in adjacent
offices on the sixth floor of MOD main building, the Personnel and
Logistics organisations are now out at the commands, PE is at Abbey
Wood, and the operational commands are working to the PJHQ and
DCDS(C).  The ACOS provide the only direct staff resource to
individual chiefs for coordinating and planning within the MOD. Their
dedicated staffs have again been moved within the organisation to
provide the central staff resource for operations, programmes and OR.
 There will be a growing sense of irrelevance for the role of
individual service chiefs. If their job is to provide fighting
capability then how does it differ from the operational C-in-Cs? Once
logistics is organised centrally (CDL), the forward programme is
organised centrally (Programmes staff), Operational Requirements are
organised centrally (DCDS(S)), Procurement is organised centrally
(CDP), and the move is made to centralise personnel management with a
CDP, the only bit of the job that is left is the operational command
and the training which could be merged with it. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>This may seem unlikely and I would not wish to forecast when it
will happen, but I think it entirely likely. The pieces have been put
in place. The rank structure will at some stage be addressed. It was
always curious to have a 3 star DCDS(P&amp;P) who chaired the 4 star
PAOs and PPOs. That has partially been corrected with the reduction
of the PAOs and PPOs to 3 star. The 4 star CDL points the way for a
rank structure which would place the hierarchy where the power lies,
and is clear that the 3 logistics CinCs will become part of his
organisation. There will be difficulties with the C-in-Cs who in
effect will be providing a capability to the Chief of Joint
Operations. Over time the logic would be for the CJO to be 4 star,
and the operational CinCs, who will have subsumed the vestigial role
of the service chiefs, to become 3 star. At some time the need for
individual headquarters will also be reviewed. There will doubtless
be a continuing need for the representative tasks undertaken by the
current COS. They could be undertaken either by the senior serving
officer from that Service - or perhaps better by the three 3 starts
under CJO.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	This is a possible future diagram of the way the services are
organised. I think everything points towards this sort of evolution.
It retains the single service training and ethos but delivers
capability on a centrally controlled (rather than joint) basis. The
cynics among you will say that it is the diminution of the military
voice vis a vis  the civilian in terms of shaping policy. There may
be an element of that, but it is as easy to argue that a unified
military voice has more power and influence that arguments between
the Services and the Centre. Will it cure the narrowness of vision
that is the cause of much of the difficulties between the Services?
There will still, as in any organisation, be turf fights, special
interest pleading, and blind dogma. A central career management would
certainly damp down the bloody minded single service approach that
has characterised particular periods. In the end it will need the
right quality of people, who are left in post long enough both to
learn the job, and be held responsible for the outcome of their
actions. Fewer duplicated  posts could make that more possible as
well. </P>
