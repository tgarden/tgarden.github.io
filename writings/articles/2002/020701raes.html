			<h3>Then and Now</h3>
			<p>We meet for this year's Sopwith lecture at a time of great uncertainty for global security. Sir Thomas Sopwith was born in 1888 &#150; fifteen years before the Wright Brothers demonstrated that heavier than air powered flight was possible and he died in 1989, as the Cold War, ended after an extraordinary lifetime of devotion to aviation. He qualified as a pilot in 1910 and  then ensured that his name would remain forever in aviation history  by producing a vast range of  military aircraft used in World War 1. The Great War, the war to end wars, saw the exploitation of air power in virtually all the roles that we would recognise today and yet new technologies had to come off the production line week after week to meet these new challenges. There were over 16,000 Sopwiths spread across 57 different types produced between 1913 and 1918. Yet as we know the vast assemblage of airpower capability was axed at the end of the war, and the Sopwith Aviaiton Company went into voluntary liquidation, even the very existence of the newly formed Royal Air Force was being questioned.<br>
				<br>
				Trenchard, who had had his first flying lessons at Sopwith's flying School, did much to preserve the delicate flower that was the RAF, and we remember his advocacy of the Imperial Policing role as a cost effective way to keep the far flung Empire under control. Churchill told the House of Commons in December 1919: &quot;The first duty of the Royal Air Force is to garrison the British Empire.&quot; Sopwith formed the HG Hawker Engineering Company, and spent the rest of his life involved in developing new British airpower capabilities. His legacy in the range of combat aircraft that Hawker Siddeley developed.<br>
				<br>
				Today we have, what has been characterised by some commentators, as a new imperial age. Again we have finished a great war, the Cold War, but seem increasingly to need to keep distant places under control, so that they do not damage our interests by descending into anarchy or even directly threaten us. Robert Cooper, as a serving diplomat, has written of the need for a &quot;new kind of imperialism, one compatible with human rights and cosmopolitan values: an imperialism which aims to bring order and organisation but which rests today on the voluntary principle.&quot; Just as Trenchard convinced the political leadership of the 20s that air power was the answer, so we now have a world that expects air power to give it victories that are cost free in casualties, and affordable for modern societies which have other more pressing  priorities. <br>
				<br>
				I will look to see whether there are any deeper parallels between the 1920s and the last decade, and,  where there are, what lessons we might learn from the past. I shall also want to focus on what this means for British air power, in an age where it is moving evermore towards  becoming a bit player to the new imperial power:  the United States. Finally, I will suggest  how European defence developments could contribute in this complex and insecure future.<br>
			</p>
			<h3>The First Age of Imperialism</h3>
			<p>So let us start with a place now familiar again to the British public: Afghanistan. But not the present, rather 83 years ago when the third Afghan War broke out along the India's then North West frontier. 5 RAF squadrons were deployed initially to support the army, but subsequently to  carry out bombing missions to put down a rebellion.  I must pay tribute to a very good analysis of the records of the period by Major Michael J.Peterson in an Air University Paper called  &quot;Wood, Fabric and Wire :insights from the biplane era&quot;. He reflects that the rules of engagement  were simply &quot;to get the tribesman to come to terms&quot;. The contemporary reports make it clear that there was little agreed strategy or tactics, while the Air Ministry was putting a very positive spin on the operations, both airmen and soldiers in theatre were rather more sceptical. The GOC of the Wazirstan (a name coming back into currency as al-Qaeda head for the province) force, General Climo, observed that bombing was highly inaccurate and that after 16 tons were dropped on one town, very little damage was done.The local air commander, an Air Commodore Webb-Bowen, said &quot;the RAF acting alone will never overcome a courageous people&quot;. A lesson which was perhaps  not fully learned by the Douhet enthusiasts, and their successors for the rest of the 20th Century. <br>
				<br>
				But then as now, it was spin rather than results which counted. A combination of shortage of cash and a political need to do something meant that air policing and air control became the flavour of the month - or rather  of the inter war period. Somaliland was the next testing ground (even the locations remain the same 80 years on).  Winston Churchill. Minister of War and Air, supported Trenchard over the head of the CIGS Field Marshal Sir Henry Wilson.  A power projection force of 12 De Havilland 9a biplanes was delivered by HMS Ark Royal in December 1919 to Berbera. (early support for aircraft carriers and power projection). Their operation against the &quot;Mad Mullah&quot;, a local warlord stirring up trouble, went down in air power history. Operations began in January 1920 and in a few weeks, the Mullah and his Dervishes were bombed and gunned from the air until they fled over the border (shades of al-Qaeda and Taliban?). The whole epic cost &pound;150k and was seen as the model for the future.<br>
				<br>
				The next task was however of a different order from chasing tribesman (whirling or not) over the border; and also has echoes with the present. Mesopotamia (modern day Iraq) was put under British mandate in mid  1920. The General Staff had, with remarkable wisdom, declared that they could not garrison the country (their successors in the US Joint Chiefs seem to be arriving at a similar conclusion today).  However they were not entirely convinced that air power could do the job either, and were not helpful in providing ground support. As a result the then AVM Sir John Salmond, as the AOC Iraq, raised four infantry battalions and 15,000 irregular locals ( an early equivalent to the Northern Alliance) to provide gound defences and patrols to support his 8 squadrons. The tactics were developed by trial and error, and were perhaps fortunate not to have to contend with CNN and BBC cameramen at every operation.  Such doctrine as there was revolved around being everywhere and using force early when disturbances arose among the population.  In the early days large scale force was used, so that a reputation for overwhelming retribution was established. This allowed a more restrained policing to be used subsequently. RAF junior officers were deployed semi-permanently around the districts to act as the forward intelligence. This was an important aspect of successful operations. People on the ground all over the country are needed.<br>
				<br>
				The rough justice methods of use of air power, which perhaps bear comparison with some recent operations by the Israeli Defence Force, to try to quell trouble in Gaza and the West Bank, were not without their critics back home. In 1924, when the Labour Party came to power, there was considerable ministerial interest in the ethics of air policing. John Salmon used the argument that while air warfare was not humane, is was accompanied by less overall suffering than the older fashioned land methods of waging war in what he called semi-civilised countries. Certainly, having the air force run Iraq until the end of 1920s was a cheaper and reasonably effective way of keeping order. The operation was perhaps rather easier than than the less successful parallel exercise in Palestine. But it is again fascinating to see some 80 years ago, the RAF suggesting that punishment bombing could keep the Palestinians in order. Lack of intelligence and the urban settings were as much a problem then as they are today.<br>
			</p>
			<h3>The Present and US Leadership</h3>
			<p>Let us flash forward 70 years.  The places, Afghanistan, Somalia, Iraq, Palestine remain relevant. League of Nations' mandates are replaced by UN resolutions. Air power is seen as an easier way to intervene rather than enmeshing large numbers of troops in difficult areas. The new imperialism of Robert Cooper is exercised by a number players: but at the forefront is the USA and then Europe, sometimes co-operating but increasingly having different perspectives on how to promote stability and order.<br>
				<br>
				Since the end of the Cold War, the US has flexed its military might in a number of areas. Over the last decade of the 20th Century, it was able to develop a new perspective on the application of military power: one that was driven by technology.  The Gulf War saw the US in the lead of a large coalition operating with the full backing of the United Nations to free Kuwait after invasion by Iraq. The shadows of the Vietnam War were finally laid to rest as the USA demonstrated that its investment in aerospace technology could produce a new way of fighting wars. The remorseless prolonged air campaign meant that the ground operation could be completed with virtually no casualties to the Allied forces. The theories of generations of air power  enthusiasts seemed at last to have been proved. Yet at the time there was no certainty of such a cost free operation. <br>
				<br>
				Subsequent experience in Somalia showed that it was still possible for the US military might to be thwarted by an unsophisticated enemy. In some respects, the Somalia operation against local warlords may become a more appropriate  model for future operations against terrorist networks.  The casualty free experience of the Gulf War had set new political standards for the way US military operations were to be conducted in operations which were not about defence of the homeland. Precision air power was seen by some to have been the key enabler for the Dayton agreement in Bosnia. In Kosovo, the doctrine had advanced to a stage where the use of ground force in hostile territory was discounted by President Clinton from the start of operations. <br>
				<br>
				Each campaign reinforced the message that air power, space systems and precision attack could allow the US (with or without its allies) to intervene, change governments, right wrongs and celebrate the American way without risking GI lives. At the same time this focus on technology has widened the military capability gap between the US and the rest of the world, which has had a profound effect on the practicality of Alliance operations. The French Air Force found itself isolated in the Gulf War because of it years away from NATO interoperability standards. A decade later, few Allies were invited to the party in the air over Afghanistan partially because even the most ardent NATO allies were failing to keep abreast of the technical standards needed to operate with the new US systems.  Allies are more about political support, overflight clearances and  basing facilities these days than about making a real military contribution to any operation which the US leads. And if the US is not in the lead, it loses interest rapidly. While post-conflict operations have been the big activity for European nations and others over the last decade,  the US forces have been reluctant participants, and some would say not too effective either. The nature and tactics of warfare have changed for the United States; but its allies have been slow to accommodate to these changes. It is now unlikely that NATO as NATO will find itself conducting a war again. </p>
			<h3>The growth of the EU as a regional power </h3>
			<p>The European Union has also changed in the decade since the end of the Cold War. Europe was the region directly affected by the fall of the Berlin Wall, the end of the Soviet Union and of the Warsaw Pact. It had lived with a very real and urgent threat of the ultimately destructive war being fought across its territory, and that threat disappeared faster than could ever have been imagined. The process of integration continued particularly with the work towards monetary union. The now 15 EU nations found themselves at peace with each other, growing more prosperous, and looking towards enlarging their membership yet further to take in the states of Central and Eastern Europe and further afield. The EU already matches the US in terms of GDP, and will draw ahead as it enlarges. It is already more populous. <br>
				<br>
				EU members have learned a number of lessons during the decade of the 90's. Europe suddenly felt safer than it had in living memory. Defence budgets fell as the worries of the Cold War were forgotten. Most operational combat forces fell by between 30 and 40%. Some countries, like the UK, took the opportunity to reshape their armed forces towards their interpretation of future needs. Others, like Germany, were slower to restructure. Germany had discovered the time and cost that it took to carry out the reunification process. To an extent it still bears the financial burden of its generous arrangement. This has given it a defence squeeze from two different directions: lack of money and inappropriate military structures. <br>
				<br>
				Yet Europe was also discovering that it could operate in some aspects as a regional power. Trade negotiations were much more effective when conducted at the EU level than by individual states. The EU could restrain unfair practices from any part of the world, and most particularly could face down the US  in trade disputes when necessary. But the EU was still missing the essential qualification to be regarded as a serious global power comparable to the US. Foreign and security policy remained largely national activities, and contributions to intervention operations are made on a national rather than regional basis. If Europe were threatened directly, then NATO was still the forum to turn to. Coping with the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia was not a great success story for the EU as a coherent security organisation. Here was a corner of Europe that was to give troubles for all EU members states as it broke up. Yet the US was needed to drive through an enforceable settlement in Bosnia; the US was needed to provide the major warfare contribution to NATO's operation in Kosovo; and NATO remained in the lead as Macedonia looked as though it might be destabilised.<br>
				<br>
				The willingness of European member states to take the military dimension of regional power seriously has still to be proved. For half a century, we Europeans were able to hide behind the collective security of NATO. The first sign that we had realised how far we had allowed our individual contributions to drop behind was in April 1999 at the NATO summit. The European members signed up to the Defence Capabilities Initiative promising to procure all the capabilities that they needed for the new tasks. Three years on, nothing has happened except that NATO is now looking at reducing its 58 declared shortcomings to half a dozen, so that it might at least focus on the most pressing.<br>
				<br>
				It looked as though the EU was going to try to do better after the UK reversed its opposition to a European defence capability, and Tony Blair went to St Malo at the end of 1999. But despite the agreement in Helsinki  to establish a capability to deploy up to 60,000 troops at short notice to trouble spots, again little in the way of new capabilites has yet been generated.<br>
				<br>
				The European capability shortfalls are well understood.  Many of them are in the air power area. We lack sufficient strategic air transport to deploy useful military capabilities quickly. We lack the all weather precision attack offensive capabilities which are essential in age which expects warfare to be surgical and accurate. We lack the strategic and tactical surveillance systems that allow the tasks to be addressed efficiently, and results analysed. We lack the air to air refueling capabilities which multiply the power of our air forces. It is not that Europe lacks air forces. The 15 members of the EU can field more than 3000 combat aircraft. But the rag bag of types date from the days of the Cold War where territorial defence was the aim rather than power projection. As budgets have declined, replacements have been cancelled and deferred. Numbers have been reduced and upgrades delayed. </p>
			<h3>The UK Dilemma</h3>
			<p>Let me now turn to what this means for the UK. What did the US find useful in Afghanistan from its closest ally? The Canberra - way past its 50th birthday; the VC10 tanker, dating from an earlier age of air transport; and the Nimrod famed once as the first ever commercial jet airliner, when it was the Comet. This is not to denigrate the important contribution that the UK was able to make in the photo recce, tanking and intelligence fields; but it shows that niche specialist capabilities were all that were wanted. Other European allies were even worse placed.<br>
				<br>
				I wrote <a href="../older/artreraf.html">a piece for the R</a><a href="../older/artreraf.html">USI Journal in October 1996</a> in which I suggested that the RAF needed to re-invent itself for the new tasks. Events since then have shown beyond question that there is a key role for airpower in the post Cold War world. The US, which had cut back defence investment just as much as Europe, has now seen the light and is heavily reinvesting in aerospace power to use in its new interventionist role.  In Britain we are still uncertain what to do for the best. The Strategic Defence Review of 1998 pre-dated the move towards European Defence, but nevertheless provided a reasonable template for the sort of force structure that a nation of our wealth might need to contribute to international peace and security. Although George Robertson claimed that it was not constrained by costs, few were surprised when the sums added up to much the same amount as before. Nevertheless, the essential programme for a serious power projection capability was laid down. This included the strategic air transport, the air to air refueling, the new generation air platforms, the surveillance systems, the aircraft carriers and the precision weapons. At the time, many, including the Defence Select Committee, commented on the fragility of the financial assumptions.<br>
				<br>
				In the middle of last year, Sir Michael Alexander, who so sadly died a fortnight ago, and I penned <a href="../2001/ia.htm">a piece for International Affairs</a> in which we explained why the current plans were heading for the rocks. Defence inflation was eating into planned capability, and we would never see the hopes fulfilled unless we took our defence needs more seriously. Since we wrote that analysis things have got worse, not least because of the implications of 11 September. In any rational world, governments would say that new threats from strategic terrorism reinforced the need to promote international peace and security. The SDR requirements become more, not less, important. There will in addition be a need to take measures against the immediate threats from al-Qaeda and its imitators. The baseline would be to fulfill the requirements of the SDR, and then pay the extra needed for additional counter-terrorism measures. <br>
				<br>
				The &quot;Added Chapter&quot; to the SDR may or may not do that. Some 9 months after the attacks on the World Trade Center, we have no white paper, but the indications are that there will be little new money. The signs of continuing capability delay are everywhere. A year's delay to the new tankers; early taking out of service of Sea Harriers, giving 6 years at least with no organic airborne air defence capability for our carriers; an F3 squadron here and some Nimrods there; another delay to Eurofighter. <br>
				<br>
				But perhaps more importantly than each of these nibbles at capability is the lack of vision about what we must do to tackle the new demands. The SDR saw a modest independent national capability to be put at the service of the UN or of NATO, or in a coalition of the willing for intervention operations. Helsinki saw the EU becoming more focused on the new demands, and Britain playing a leading role. The EU could do some important tasks on its own when appropriate, or could join with the US through NATO for more demanding undertakings. But now, we, the UK, seem to be sliding back to an assumption that our military capability is there to buy us political influence with the US. We can dispense with a key air defence element of the fleet, because the US will provide it. We need only equip a few submarines with a tiny number of cruise missiles because their purpose is the political support of US operations, not as an independent military capability. <br>
				<br>
				The attractions to the RAF and RN  of operating with their US opposite numbers is great, but the danger of this growing dependence as junior partner is greater. It will always be possible to justify cuts, delays and savings in the defence programme if it is built on the assumption that we are forever to be bit players to a much more capable US force. Our electorate will lose interest in their armed forces if they become used to a British role of sweeping up after America. </p>
			<h3>A vision of Europe as a military power</h3>
			<p>If this is a problem for the UK, where we see an ever diminishing share of GDP spent on defence, it is also critical throughout the rest of Europe. Those who have heard me elsewhere will be relieved that I shall not spend much time on my familiar refrain of the need for much greater integration of military capability throughout the EU. For those that have not, I would briefly summarise the arguments as being a need to rationalise the 15 armies, 14 air forces and 13 navies to produce a much better return on the 140bn Euros spent each year on defence. Air power is the easiest area for such rationalisation, and the one which produces the largest and quickest payback. A European air force would pack a modern useful punch at much lower cost than the collection of out of date capabilities scattered across the EU nations. Europe with a modern air power capability tailored to the new world would be better placed to play a part in the new benevolent imperialism in its own way.  <br>
				<br>
				While the political difficulties of such deep integration and interdependence of EU air forces remain high, there is much that could be done now which would not be controversial, and would release funds for the key air power enabling capabilities which Europe lacks. NATO has shown that supranational capabilities work with its AWACs international force. We should look for similar ways of operating EU capabilities, which would be available to NATO as well as to EU operations. In the field of outsourcing and contractorisation there are many opportunities for European answers which would be cheaper, and would also improve interoperability. <br>
				<br>
				I have said little about the industrial dimension in all of this, and given that this is an aspect of particular interest to the Society, I shall mention it briefly. In my view, there remains a need for a competitive aerospace industry which can provide the tools for the complex tasks ahead. Keeping our air power procurement divided and under national control means that the US industry will grow and the European diminish as it tries to cater to different national priorities. While I would do nothing to featherbed local industries, I can see that the only long term hope for a viable European defence market is a European defence budget funding European defence capabilities.</p>
			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>Let me bring us back to where I started from. We think that we have come a long way over the last century of aviation. Yet Sopwith could produce tailored capabilities at the rate of a dozen different versions a year. Today we take decades to produce each new platform, and spend years in each upgrade. Between the wars we attempted to keep Afghanistan, Iraq, Palestine, Somalia and the North West Frontier under control from the air - today we expect the same. The changes have been the real cost of airpower, which makes it an expensive option, and the extra value put on the lives of both combatants and civilians which makes the nature of warfare different. Yet the idea remains, and the evidence suggests it to be true, that order can be achieved through air power. What is clear now (as it was in the 1920s) is that you still need a presence on the ground to maintain that order. In this respect I think we shall live to regret the international community&#146;s lack of willingness to deploy stabilising troops through Afghanistan. It will also be a tragedy after the long decade sorting out the Balkans, the US continues to use the threat of ending the peacekeeping force in Bosnia as a lever in its war against the ICC.<br>
				<br>
				 The choice we have in Britain, and in Europe more widely,  is whether we finally hand the air power baton over to the United States as the new imperial power, or whether we still think we can play a serious role. If we want our airpower to count, and we want it to be viable, we must face up to the need to make European defence work. European national air capabilities will continue to atrophy year by year unless regional rationalisation is pursued. The UK should have no problems with redefining  the role of its air forces as a leading and key element of a European air capability rather than as a political element of US imperial air power. Thomas Sopwith had no shortage of  imagination and innovation &#150; let us hope that we can match such vision today.<br>
