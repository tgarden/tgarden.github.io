			<p><b>Defense Strategy for the post-Saddam era. By Michael E.O'Hanlon. </b></p>
			<p>Washington DC: Brookings Institution Press. 2005. 137pp. Index. Pb: $18.95. ISBN 0-8157-6467-7</p>

			<p>How is it that the greatest military power in&nbsp; the history of the world is overextended with just one major post-conflict operation in Iraq and relatively minor operations elsewhere? The United States 2005 defence budget&nbsp; is expected to be around&nbsp; $520 billion with another $40 billion going on Homeland Security. The US will&nbsp; probably be spending as much on defence this year as the rest of the world put together. Michael O'Hanlon explains the problems that the Pentagon planners face. Much of what he says will be familiar territory to any defence ministry planner in any democratic country which fields volunteer armed forces.&nbsp; He opens with the strategic backdrop, and assumes that US forces will remain engaged in Iraq and Afghanistan for the foreseeable future. Deterrence missions for Korea and Taiwan will continue. He explores later in the book how conflict in these two theatres might develop. Engagement with European security will remain important, not least to keep NATO available to help elsewhere. He points to the uncertainties in future over China,&nbsp; Pakistan and Saudi Arabia and perhaps other regions. He looks at a possible future security requirement for Palestine. Strangely an intervention in Iran is given only a passing mention. Against these tasks, he details the current force structures.&nbsp; The US has 1.4 million active duty personnel, nearly a&nbsp; million reservists and 750,000 defence civilians.&nbsp; 400,000 troops are deployed beyond its borders. The force is structured against a requirement to be able simultaneously to defend the homeland,&nbsp; deter in four theatres, fight two wars, and be capable of winning one of them overwhelmingly including occupying territory.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>O'Hanlon's view that there are insufficient deployable troops to fulfil the current tasks will surprise no one.&nbsp; He examines the lessons of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars to see whether the Rumsfeld vision of&nbsp; a new form of warfare dependent on technology and small&nbsp; ground forces is justified.&nbsp; He concludes rightly that precision weaponry has changed warfare, but that troops in significant numbers are still needed both for some warfighting, but most importantly for subsequent stabilisation tasks. He argues that an extra 40,000 soldiers and marines are needed in addition to the already planned increase of 25,000; and that any delay will exacerbate the problem as overstretch leads to retention problems among those currently serving.</p>
			<p>In looking at the policy options to increase the number of ground troops, he examines the possibility of raising a <i>carabinieri </i>style force for stabilisation operations. The constraints on using such a force in a complex theatre such as Iraq makes him argue that the idea has limited utility.&nbsp; Next the reinstatement of the Draft is explored. O'Hanlon is unenthusiastic given the problems of both professional competence and social divisiveness. Yet, he leaves the door open in case an exodus from the all volunteer force becomes too large. There are other structural options, such as the use of reservists for homeland security and the realignment of overseas bases.&nbsp; Such moves may offer relief at the margin.&nbsp; The one fix that he believes could help&nbsp; is if&nbsp; the US could share the burden more with allies.</p>
			<p>Britain and Australia are singled out for praise. The have shown other Western countries how &quot;they can acquire significantly more ability to deploy forces without increasing their budgets substantially.&quot; This suggests that O'Hanlon has not looked too closely either at current UK budget difficulties or the increases which Australia has had to make.&nbsp; He updates a famous 1998 Brookings' quote to say that Europe now spends nearly half the US budget and gets no more than a fifth overall deployable capacity. He does not however address the real issue of the divergence between the European approach to global security problems and the US doctrine. The intervention in Iraq in 2003 made traditional alliance operations much less likely in the future.&nbsp; While the NATO Response Force may give a force of 20,000 deployable troops, the US can hardly depend on political agreement to use them whenever it chooses.</p>
			<p>The US equipment programme is reviewed very briefly. Despite the author's caveat that too much fervour over transformation can lead to misallocation of funds, he seems an enthusiast for some of the new technology. The missile defence programme is to be retained despite its cost and lack of progress. He keeps the Cold War F/A-22 fighter programme and scales back the Joint Strike Fighter. He is sure that major allied partners can accept a delay of some years. While commending Britain's progress in becoming a useful ally, it appears he would have no difficulty in leaving the Royal Navy's new aircraft carriers without their aircraft. He makes some welcome suggestions on reducing nuclear weapon systems and development. However the overall effect on the current US equipment procurement is relatively small, and he seeks increased expenditure in the coming years.</p>
			<p>In sum, this book is more a commentary than a strategy. Most analysts will agree the need for more US troops to cope with their self-imposed tasks. The mechanisms for freeing up resources will be familiar to defence planners everywhere. Salami slicing of equipment programmes with delays to make the books balance. What is missing from this volume is any consideration that perhaps the US should temper its military ambitions. The book opens with a nod at the poor state of the federal deficit. Yet in the end, O'Hanlon signs up to the continual real increases in the already massive US military spending. Perhaps Brookings needs to commission another author to consider whether the colossal sums involved might be used in other ways to make the world a better and safer place.&nbsp;</p>
