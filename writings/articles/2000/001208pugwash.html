<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">It is easy to understand the immediate
appeal to both military and civilian of the thought that it might be
possible to provide defences against such an awful prospect as a
nuclear or other WMD attack. The US has a long and expensive history
of attempting to provide itself with defences against incoming
ballistic missile attack. The first attempts of the 60's were
abandoned when it became clear that such defences were technically
infeasible, and did no more than stimulate the Soviet Union to
increase the numbers of its nuclear tipped missiles. The possibility
of multiple warhead missiles made defences even less reliable and
reduced the stability of deterrence. In a wonderful moment of
rationality, the US and the Soviet Union agreed to the Anti-Ballistic
Missile (ABM) Treaty of 1972 which severely limited the defensive
system that each side could deploy. It was a treaty in which not only
both sides benefited from increased security, but the world at large
- and Europe in particular - applauded the reduced impetus for a
nuclear arms race. As technology improved, industry again offered a
vision of providing leakproof missile defences, and President Reagan
held out the prospect in a speech in 1983. The Strategic Defence
Initiative (SDI) spent billions of dollars, but came no closer to
providing a reliable defence against a nuclear strikes.  The UK
Government then showed interest in the hope of getting a share of the
research funds, but was  sceptical about feasibility.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The arguments against Star Wars in the early
80s had been on technical , strategic, military effectiveness,
financial and stability grounds. The new proposals for NMD draw on
the SDI  technologies but look to a much more limited requirement.
The threat to the continental United States is assumed to come at
some time in the future from a "rogue state" (now called states of
concern). These are normally thought to include North Korea, Iran or
Iraq. Although for the non-nuclear weapons of mass destruction, the
CIA has identified up to 20 states that might develop long range
missiles, and have interests that are at variance with those of the
US. Each is expected to have very few missiles capable of carrying
weapons of mass destruction over intercontinental distances. The
technical problems of interception are therefore expected to be much
less. There is a political consensus among Democrats and Republicans
that NMD should go ahead if it is technically possible, and Congress
has ensured that there is also a legal requirement. The system
testing so far has been ( to put it at its kindest) ambiguous, and
the third key interception test failed badly. Europe celebrated
President Clinton's decision to put off any decision until his
successor is in post. Technical capability may be better than it was,
but remains unable to provide an impermeable screen.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The strategic implications are still much
the same as they were for SDI, despite the end of the Cold War and
the more limited declaratory aims. Some  fear that undermining the
ABM treaty will unpick all the hard won achievements of arms control
over the past 30 years. It is argued by some (and I detect this may
become the UK official position) that if the US manages to
renegotiate the treaty with the Russians, there would be no such
problem. Unfortunately, the elements of the NMD system are not just
minor changes to the treaty. The thrust of the ABM treaty is to
prohibit a nation-wide defensive system. NMD also requires
treaty-banned space-based sensors and radars outside of the United
States. The Russians are currently playing hardball. President Putin
has made it clear that he wishes to retain the ABM treaty and move to
smaller deployments of strategic missiles on both US and Russian
soil. This would be a good thing - but I think we must consider
whether it is likely to remain the Russian approach for the coming
year. They realise that there is little to be gained in the dying
days of the Clinton Presidency. If they wish to negotiate, they need
to do it with the next administration. They are in a good position to
play the ABM treaty long. They may well be prepared to renegotiate
given the right incentives, which are as likely to be economic as to
to be security based. If an incoming Republican administration
decides to unilaterally withdraw from the treaty (as it is legally
entitled to do by giving 6 month's notice), then the Russia can take
the moral high ground. I think therefore that the rest of the world
needs to look carefully at the implications of some form of deal
between the US and Russia over the ABM treaty. It is not sufficient
to say that this is a bilateral treaty which we are not a party to.
We have benefited greatly from the reduction in incentive for
increasing warheads over the years, and we will lose out if a new
arms race results from an irrelevant ABM treaty. Indeed we ought
perhaps be looking to extend the treaty to become multilateral, but
that is a different issue.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">What might the effect be of the end of an
effective ABM treaty? The obvious response for declared nuclear
powers is to increase the number of nuclear systems they field to a
level where they feel they can still maintain their strategic
deterrence requirements. For various reasons, the one nuclear power
that is most likley to react initially is China. The US and Russia
both still have more than enough strategic nuclear systems. It might
affect perceptions about what levels they can downsize towards; but
they have plenty of room for manoeuvre. Indeed the Bush team have
been saying that an effective NMD system would allow them to come
down to 3000 warheads with confidence. It is not clear whether
Congress would deliver this promise. Russia might have much more
difficulty in implenting a downsizing at a time when the US had
withdrawn unilaterally from the ABM treaty. In the past the UK has
worried about the effect of missile defences, and the very expensive
Chevaline programme for Polaris decoys was about overcoming missile
defences. However it has room for increasing within the Trident
system, in the unlikely event that it felt that it needed to respond.
The French are unlikely to feel that they need to do much about their
systems . China is in a different position. It has relatively few
strategic missiles. As the IISS Military Balance says:  </FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">" China's strategic
capability is composed of less than 200 nuclear warheads of which
perhaps 20-30 would be operational at any given time. To be sure of
over-coming even a limmited missile-defence capability, China would
have to spend resources on increasing its strategic weapons and
enhancing counter-measures (including using multiple warheads)."
</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">With no mobile land missiles and only one
SSBN, China will also have increased worries about pre-emtive nuclear
attack, and this of course will have knock on effects on its
readiness posture. It is likely to see a greater need for launch on
warning type arrangements.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">An increase in China's nuclear armoury does
not just affect the US/China nuclear elationship. India's main reason
for a nuclear capability is China (not Pakistan, which it could
easily defeat conventionally. If China goes on to a more offensive
nuclear posture, India is likely to follow suit and Pakistan will
follow the lead. So we see increased nuclear dangers far remote from
the protection of the US continent.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Looking at the postulated threat which NMD
is designed to counter raises a number of questions. Iran, Iraq and
North Korea are reasonably certain potential proliferators. The CIA
report in August 2000 says:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Iran</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Iran sought nuclear-related equipment,
material and technical expertise from a variety of sources,
especially in Russia." Iran is attempting to finish its Bushehr
reactor and "establish a complete nuclear fuel cycle." While Tehran
claims that these activities are purely for civilian energy
applications, the report warns that Iran "continues to seek fissile
material and technology for weapons development" and uses civilian
entities as part of an "elaborate system" devoted to furthering these
efforts.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">North Korea</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">While North Korea has made enough plutonium
for one to two nuclear weapons and continues to purchase items that
potentially could be used in nuclear weapons production, we do not
know of any procurement directly linked to the nuclear weapons
program.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Iraq</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">We do not have any direct evidence that Iraq
has used the period since Desert Fox to reconstitute its WMD
programs, although given its past behavior, this type of activity
must be regarded as likely.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Syria and Libya have become less so in
recent times. Given particular circumstances, Saudi Arabia, South
Korea, Taiwan and Egypt might become interested.  In terms of missile
delivery systems, the only nations either operating or developing
capabilities for missiles of over 500km range are: the 5 NWS,  India,
Iran, Iraq, Israel, N Korea, Libya, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Syria and
Taiwan. All of these are in reaction to regional rather than global
balances of power, although gaining a nuclear capability would change
their status within the international community. Iran is active in
its development of both cruise and long range ballistic missiles.
Iraq can do little about longer range missiles while UN sanctions
continue. Libya has tried unsuccessfully to obtain longer range
missile technology. North Korea is actively obtaining such technology
from China.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In summary then, the future nuclear threats
from states are unlikely to be as severe as they were in the Cold War
days. The major problem remains Russia, and that needs to be handled
in ways other than militarily.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">We need also to consider the threat from
other weapons of mass destruction the Chemical and Biological agents.
The potential of biological agents as strategic weapons has not been
lost on Saddam Hussein in Iraq. While the UNSCOM inspection team have
been fairly successful in destroying his nuclear and chemical warfare
capacity, they are less certain how well they have done in reducing
his ability to manufacture biological weapons. It appears that Iraq
is still intent on achieving a strategic capability using weapons of
mass destruction, and that it is more likely to be successful through
its biological warfare research programmes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The August 2000 CIA report says:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Iraq may have more CW left over
from the Iran-Iraq War then previously anticipated.  Iraq has rebuilt
a number of facilities destroyed in bombing during the Gulf War and
Desert Fox, and is attempting to develop unmanned aerial vehicles
that could be used for delivering CW and BW.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Iran possesses a number of CW, including
blister, blood, and choking agents and the bombs and artillery shells
for delivering them.  Iran continues to seek outside assistance in
all aspects of chemical weapons development, particularly from Russia
and China. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">After UN sanctions against it were dropped
in April of last year, Libya wasted no time in attempting to obtain
chemical weapons components and expertise from other countries,
primarily in Western Europe. Libya still wants to establish its own
offensive CW capability and continues to pursue an indigenous
production capability.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">North Korea has both the production capacity
and means of delivery for a wide variety of CW and BW</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"> Emerging powers  may decide it is better to
go less traditional routes with their WMD delivery systems. None of
this is helpful in promotion confidence and safety. There are also
worries about what the deployment of such a system would mean for
NATO. If the US had provided for itself a shield which was not
available to the rest of NATO, would this affect the internal
alliance relationships adversely? Governor Bush's advisors assure
critics that they would provide effective protection for Europe as
well. The technical viability of this extended system is even more
suspect, the cost enormously greater and there would be a transition
period of perhaps years before the system was extended. Europeans do
not share the US view of how to handle the threat of proliferation in
difficult states. Nor do they believe that a missile defensive system
protects against the many different types of threat that are now
emerging. In some respects the long range missile threat is the least
likely and nuclear deterrence remains a sufficient strategy. Indeed
the main sources of concern (North Korea, Iran and Iraq) are
currently being addressed in different ways.  We need also to look at
the range of counter measures, which are available to us and our
Allies. These are broadly: regulation, deterrence,  offensive
operations, defensive measures both passive and active.  The
regulation regime can be co-operative through arms control, and
nonco-operative through export controls of critical material. Arms
control sometimes gets a bad press, but I would argue it has been
remarkably successful in constraining proliferation. It has roles in
nuclear, chemical and biological. Arms control is well structured in
the nuclear field with the NPT, START, fissile material cut off,
CTBT, nuclear weapon free zones. There are proposals for dealerting
and unilateral reductions of weapons from nuclear weapon states.
There have been deals to control North Korea programmes.  On the much
more difficult side of Chemical weapons, the 1993 CWC entered force
1997 with 2/3 of countries of concern signing. 1972 BWC in force 1975
- lacks effective verification regime. Where arms control fails to
stop proliferators, the next line of defence is deterrence. In the
nuclear field this is well understood, but it is less clear in the
case of biological and chemical attack.  The ambiguity in the UK's
position over the use of nuclear weapons re-inforces the deterrent
effect.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Control of availability of dangerous
cultures is an obvious recommendation. However, there are many
potential killer agents, and also many entirely legitimate uses for
them. The need for good intelligence is highlighted, but this will
never be the complete answer in a democratic society. These
discomforting conclusions mean that limiting the threat may mean
expending most effort on preparation for coping with the outbreak of
infection in order to minimise loss of life. While, precautionary
inoculation against the most likely biological warfare diseases may
be possible for military troops who are at direct risk, it is
unlikely to be an effective or desirable general approach. The key to
defensive measures must be early detection of a release of biological
agents. Biotechnology is offering some prospect of fast reacting
sensors, which can rapidly identify a wide range of agents. The
universal wearing of a relatively inexpensive protective mask is
recommended as a way of reducing civilian casualties from aerosol
agents, such as anthrax, by several orders of magnitude. Quick
response medical teams, who are trained to recognise a biological
warfare event are also needed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"> Measures to counter the problem are
many,complex and need to be tailored to the different risks. One
hundred percent saftey is not possible, but the outlook is not
hopeless. Careful diplomacy, economic measures, intelligence
gathering and defensive and offensive preparations can do much to
contain the risks.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The costs of NMD remain very high, and will
undoubtedly drain defence resources from other more urgent needs.
Some who worry about managing the sorts of conflicts we have been
involved in lately worry about the US focusing its defence
expenditure on the wrong priority. However in the end, the spending
issue is one for the US alone. While the US economy booms, they  can
easily afford the costs, even if they are in the end wasted
again.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">On military effectiveness, it is difficult
to imagine a level of defensive assurance that will change the
approach the US takes in its dealing with difficult nations. No
future President would be so confident of the efficacy of an NMD
system that he would ignore the potential risk of an NMD strike. 
From a military perspective, the loss of money for other capabilities
is likely to be the more important aspect.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">However, despite these  doubts, which are
shared by a wide body of opinion in and out of government in Europe,
what right have we Europeans to interfere in the internal security
arrangements of the United States? The answer of course is that we
fear that NMD will make the world a more dangerous place, will reduce
European security and in the UK give us some internal as well
external problems.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The particular policy problem for the UK
government is that two installations (Fylingdales radar station and
Menwith Hill) may both be integral parts of any US NMD system. The
necessary upgrades are likely to breach the ABM treaty unless it is
renegotiated or abrogated. The UK has therefore some leverage with
any US administration. To preserve that leverage, it has doggedly
stuck to a formula that says " since the US has not requested
upgrades as yet, we have not addressed the policy". This is has
worked well so far, despite criticism of NMD from the Foreign Affairs
Committee and other commentators. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Earlier this year, it looked as though the
UK felt that its best role might be to help to broker the best
modified ABM treaty that it could. This is not a role which would
make many friends in the rest of Europe. It would be seen as another
example of the UK being more with the US than with Europe. There are
also domestic political issues. It may prove difficult to explain why
the UK is hosting two key parts of an American defensive system,
which in the first instance provides no extra security to Britain.
Indeed in any future war, we might expect these facilities to be high
priority for attack. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Conservative party are more sympathetic 
to US NMD aspirations, and it is another issue in their constant
battle against the rest of Europe. They support NMD and want the UK
to offer whatever is necessary. The  Liberal Democrats want the UK to
oppose NMD and look to strengthening ties with Europe and bolstering
the arms control regime. We have therefore a potentially divisive
political issue if the new administration moves quickly on the UK
participation in any NMD scheme. For now the Government has quietly
celebrated the failure of the critical test, and President Clinton's
deferment of the decision.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">What should we and the rest of the
international community do? After all, every American you talk with
says that NMD is a done deal. No politician would speak against it -
any more than they would speak against the death penalty. A move
which is likely to result in a less safe world in general, and a less
safe Britain in particular, for no advantage is one in which Britain
and Europe have a legitimate interest. Perhaps there is now a Common
Foreign and Security Policy interest for Europe which is not shared
by the United States.  The real question is whether we damage our
security more by  accepting that the US is going to do this anyway,
and hoping that the technical difficulties will cause it to take much
much longer than forecast, or whether we risk a serious split with
the US over this issue. European opinion undoubtedly had an influence
earlier this year. There might be merit in supporting a more
evolutionary approach toward missile defences for deployed military
formations. These would be technically more likely to work, cost less
and have a strategic rationale. Some of the NMD technologies are
entirely appropriate for more limited theatre missile defences. If
agreement were possible on this approach, with a maintenance of the
ABM treaty, I think we might look forward to a safer rather more
dangerous world. Whatever, we need to continue the dialogue with the
new administration in the US, and not lose out doubly by causing a
transatlantic security rift and also suffering the reduction in
safety implicit in early decisions on NMD deployment.</FONT></P>
