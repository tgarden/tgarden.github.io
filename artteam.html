<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>A Presentation to the ABI Staff Seminar - 23
September 1996</H4>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I wonder which of us is the more surprised: you to find an air
marshal talking to you at the end of your staff seminar, or me to
find myself with the remit to wind-up the day by offering the
Association of British Insurers some thoughts on how we achieve the
task in a Royal Air Force setting. As I know little of the structure
of your own organisation, I shall not even attempt to draw parallels
in your field. I hope however that I can sow some seeds of our
management techniques, which may have a wider application.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The video clip, which was the introduction to the RAF's PR video
for this year, had two purposes: one to wake you up at with a change
of pace, and the other to remind you of the business that the RAF is
in. We are there for one reason only, that is to provide the air
power military capability which you as taxpayers have paid for. And
it is not cheap. Of the &pound;22 billion or so that goes on defence
each year around about a third goes on RAF related activities. The
Commander in Chief of Strike Command has a budget of &pound;1812
million pounds a year to run. We are a surprisingly small
organisation, and are in the midst of a downsizing operation.
Currently just under 70,000 people, the RAF will be at about 52,000
by the end of the Century. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>People often believe that management in the Services is easy.
After all the officers give orders and the bloody infantry does what
it is told. Of course one could say that was true of any
organisation. The Boss says do it, and you do it, or else. But none
of can operate successfully that way, and in an organisation as
complex and demanding as the RAF, it does not work in that simplistic
way. The Commander-in Chief depends on his organisation to provide
him with the key information to deliver the military power that he is
required to within the money that he has been allocated. He can only
manage such a system by delegating power and responsibility, like any
Chief Executive. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>But I do not want to spend my short time talking about the
parallels with business. Let me instead focus on the sharp end, and
as an example look at how the organisation gets a bomb on the target,
who it involves, how they are organised, managed and led. By
highlighting an individual example, I hope you will be able to
multiply up the thousands of different such activities that take
place. Let us follow a Tornado bomber crew through their day, and see
who they rely on and how they do their task. The crew is made up of
just two people - the pilot and the navigator. Technology has made
aircrew numbers smaller. The Tornado carries much the same bombload
as a Lancaster over much the same range ( a touch faster) but needs
just a crew of 2 because of the modern avionic systems. The
Eurofighter will be a single man operation. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Our intrepid pair start their day perhaps 3 hours before they are
due to be in the air. The Tornado is an all weather day and night
aircraft, and so the working day may start in the middle of the
night. They will meet at the squadron, and the squadron today is no
different from those you see in films of the Battle of Britain or
indeed those of the RFC in the first world war. It is the basic
fighting unit which forges a cohesive team, like the regiment in the
army and the ship's company in the navy. Typically the squadron will
have 12 aircraft of its own, perhaps 24 crews to man those aircraft -
and so for the Tornado with its pilot and navigator that would be 48
aircrew. It will then have its own engineers who can cope with the
routine day to day maintenance and refuelling, and rearming of the
aircraft. This may be 100 men as they must be able to provide shifts
around the clock, and specialist trades for the highly technical
aircraft. The squadron then is both a set of buildings, normally by
the servicing hangar and bunkers where the aircraft live, and also
some 150 people who are dedicated to providing Tornado missions. 
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>So back to our two aviators who have arrived to start their day.
They will have known from yesterday when they were expecting to fly,
and what sort of sortie they were due to do. Their first action will
be to check the squadron operations room to see that the programme
has remained unchanged. The squadron engineers will have been working
through the small hours to make sure that the aircraft will be ready
on time, perhaps an aircraft has been having its deep maintenance by
the station engineers, and is at last returned to the squadron after
week's of being stripped down to the bare essentials. The station
supply organisation will have provided fuel, oil, oxygen, hydraulic
fluid, all to be there at the necessary time. None of this will pass
through our flyer's minds. The fact that the aircraft is shown on the
board as available for take-off on time means that they do not need
to worry about the hundreds of tasks that have come together to
prepare it. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I make this point  because what we focus on, and what we saw in
the clip is the exciting bit: the roar of jet engines with
afterburner, the exhilaration of 500 knots at low level. To make that
happen requires not the barking of orders to be obeyed without
question, but the well oiled machine which knows exactly what is
required, who will do it and how to bring together the operations
efficiently. Indeed these days there may be no spoken word exchanged.
An intranet system can allow the station operations staff, the
squadron flying and engineering controls, the station engineers and
suppliers and armourers all to be aware of what is required and plan
their part of this complex operation. However do not let me leave you
with the impression that it will work faultlessly every time. With so
many critical activities, things do go wrong - and the telephone will
be certainly be rattling.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>But less us return to our pair. They are content that all this
manic activity is happening and they have enough time for a cup of
coffee before they start the rigorous planning for their flight. They
will, as is often the case, not be flying as a single aircraft but as
part of a formation of four, training to evade enemy air defences and
deliver a bomb to a target and to return again through enemy defences
safely. The other six aircrew appear in the coffee bar at the same
time, and the newest man on the squadron makes the coffee - some
things never change. With mugs in hand they now make for the planning
room. The first concern is the weather. 24 hours a day the station
meteorological services will be plotting the weather and producing
local, and national forecasts. These are much more detailed than
those that you see on the tv. The navigator will want to know in
detail the temperature, wind direction and speed at the particular
height to be flown over each part of the route. The pilot will need
to know where he can expect to be flying in cloud, what the
visibility will be when he is in the clear, what the weather for
landing will be, whether there are diversions in case he cannot land
at base. Again the met team knows this requirement and will have the
information ready. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>One aircraft will be nominated to lead the formation and will tell
the crews in outline how the sortie will run, so that they can plan
in detail. It is not necessarily the most experienced pilot who is
the formation leader, as this is a training mission; and new  men and
women need to have their skills brought on. Perhaps I should say that
one can see 3 different forms of expertise in combat pilots: there
are the pure flying skills: these come from 3 years of flying
training (at a cost of over &pound;3 million each), and constant
practice both in the air and in simulators with routine flying tests.
An instrument rating test is an annual requirement for every pilot in
the RAF, a handling skills and emergency check is also required at
regular, but not less than annually.  It is like having to retake
your driving test every year. So each member of this formation knows
that they are all able to fly the aircraft safely. Nobody is excused
because of rank or seniority. [story of helicopter wet escape drill]
The training produces trust in each other's ability. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Secondly, after flying skill, there is the skill of operating the
aircraft as a weapon system. This can only be done if the pilot and
navigator operating skills are second nature. Again training is the
key, and crews will be at different levels of expertise depending on
how much experience they have of the aircraft. The key here is the
teamwork between the pilot and the navigator. Each has different
tasks, and neither can complete the task without the other. They are
seated in separate compartments in tandem and will communicate in the
air by microphone. They will be travelling at speeds of around 8
miles per minute at heights down to 100 feet and they will be under
threat of surprise attack, unpredicted weather, and have to find
their target and hit it with a weapon. They need to trust each other,
understand each other, and work as the ultimate team. Ideally, pilots
and navigators remain paired up for a reasonable length of time. But
there will be times when they cannot, and for this reason
standardisation of procedures is very important. Any pilot should be
able to fly with any navigator at no notice. It is not likely that
they will be as good as the teams who have operated together for
months, but they must be able to do the job.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The third of these skills is that of leading the formation. I
should perhaps explain that this is not a formation like the red
arrows or those tight formations of display aircraft that you see at
air shows. All the pilots could do that sort of formation without too
much difficulty, and will have practised it often during their flying
training. It looks hazardous because the aircraft are so close: in
fact the very closeness helps the pilot keep his position. For a
combat mission, it would be foolish to place all your aircraft
together where a single missile might destroy all four. In this case
the aircraft need to be far enough apart to improve their
survivability, and also to provide extra eyes to look out for
attacking aircraft and other hazards. Typically the aircraft may be a
mile or so apart, and to the ground spectator may not even appear to
be travelling as a single unit. This is a much more difficult team to
lead. The leader must know where his other 3 aircraft are, and
operate them as a mutually re-informing team, while ensuring that
enemy defences are evaded and the target is found and successfully
attacked. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Once the planning is complete, a formal briefing for the sortie is
carried out by the leader. This may take half an hour to cover every
aspect of the trip. Which aircraft is responsible for what? The types
of weapons, the routes, the contingency plans, the emergency
procedures. If anything can go wrong, everyone should be clear what
will be done? Military flying is demanding but great fun. There is a
dilemma between the need to train aircrew to face and surmount risks
in war, but also maintain flight safety and operate strictly within
the confines of the military flying rules. There are no lack of these
rules. Each month every aircrew will sign to say that he knows these
rules, every flight he will check for any new rules, temporary
restrictions, and new warnings. The final  check in the squadron is
to check out at the operations room. An experienced supervisor will
ensure that nothing has been forgotten, that all the information has
been passed, that the team is properly prepared for its task in terms
of preparatory training and then the will sign an authorisation for
the flight, followed by the captain of each aircraft signing to say
he understands what he is authorised to do. This formal process is
very important in ensuring that the professional approach to flying
is never allowed to slip. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Don't Assume - check</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Passing through the safety equipment section the crews will
collect their personalised flying equipment, prepared by the
dedicated team of technicians. If they have to eject from the
aircraft they will be depending on the safety equipment all working.
They know that it will, because the preparation of dinghy, emergency
radio and the hundred other bits and pieces has been just as
professional as their own sortie briefing.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>And now to the Line - not really a line of aircraft any more at
many stations, since the building of hardened aircraft shelters. But
the engineering centre where the aircraft is handed over from the
engineers to the aircrew. Each aircraft has a book which is a record
of every action that has ever been taken on it. The engineering teams
will record what they have done, and where the action is of a
critical system, say removing the control column, someone will also
record that he or she checked that it had been put back correctly.
But the pilot as he checks this book does not worry about all this
detail. He knows that the training and supervision system of the
engineers means that he can have confidence that if their team leader
has said it is ready to fly, then it is. hat he wants to check is any
limitations peculiar to this airframe, and any history of problems in
the past, and confirm his weapon load and his fuel. It takes a couple
of minutes. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>As he goes out to the aircraft, his checks around the outside will
seem cursory and may even remind you of "kick the tyres and light the
fires". He is relying on the professionalism of the engineers to have
done the detailed checks. What he is now doing is ensuring the
removal of  some of the protective locks and covers which are left in
place until the last moment before flying. As he climbs into the
cockpit, he will check that the seals on his ejector seat show that
it is as the specialist engineer left it when he serviced it. Again
trust, because the system trains the teams, provides supervision and
rechecks critical items.  And at that stage they start up, check in
with Air Traffic Control, another team which will be with them for
much of the trip, and take off. The trip continues and involves many
other teams of experts: air traffic, air defence squadrons, fighter
controllers, weapons' ranges. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I hope I have begun to build up a picture in your mind, not of a
military organisation where senior officers issue edicts, to junior
officers, who tell other ranks to get on with it. What we have is a
series of teams full of continuously trained and tested experts. The
training system for each is such that others can have confidence in
their skills and know that they will do their job properly. Where
human failing might be critical, supervisory cross-checks are put
into the system. A service which has to be able to do these difficult
tasks under fire must ensure that each individual's sense of
responsibility is developed. Each member of a team must be able to do
his task, and be confident that all his colleagues can do their's.
Training (and that means continuous in-service training),
professionalism and pride in excellence are qualities which I am sure
are as important to the Association of British Insurers as they are
to the Royal Air Force.</P>
