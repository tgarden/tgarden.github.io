<H2><CENTER>Europe a Strategic Power?</CENTER></H2>

<ADDRESS><CENTER>Sir Timothy Garden</CENTER></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><CENTER>Lille 1 April 1999</CENTER></ADDRESS>

<P ALIGN=RIGHT>			</P>

<P>	Europe is an economic power, but it is a long way from being a
strategic power. To be a strategic power requires two key elements: a
clear and coherent foreign policy, and the diplomatic and military
means to implement that foreign policy. Europe currently has neither.
For the 21st Century we must ask first whether we want Europe to
become a strategic power. For myself, but not necessarily for most
people in Britain, the answer must be yes. It seems inconceivable  to
me that a region which is as rich and populous as the United States,
particularly after the start of monetary union, can expect to
continue its foreign and security policy on either an exclusively 
national basis or only through NATO.</P>

<P>	We see the limitations of the European position today as we try
to deal with the Balkans. Even for a tragedy on our doorstep, we must
look to the USA to provide the lead and the major military
capabilities. We must shape our strategy for Europe always mindful of
how it will play in Congress. We see this now as we debate the use of
ground troops in Kosovo. NATO is important, but we cannot be sure
that it will always be there to save us from ourselves.</P>

<P>	The question then is how do we develop a European Foreign and
Security Policy which is underpinned by the necessary diplomatic and
military capability to implement it. We need a design which maintains
NATO but gives us a European capability to protect and promote
European vital interests.The arguments too often revolve around the
institutional debates. The confusion of acronyms and organisations.
The linkages between NATO, WEU, and the EU, coupled with debates over
second and fourth pillars, do little to advance the military
capability.</P>

<P>	A recent analysis by the Brookings Institution claims that
"despite spending two thirds of what the United States does on
defense, European NATO countries have less than 10 per cent of the
transportable defense capability for prompt long range action." In
the Kosovo operation, we have seen the almost total reliance on US
capability, with the European nations each providing quite small
capabilities. Hopes for fixing the problems of European defence
capability currently centre on each nation modernising their military
on a national basis. I believe that we are more likely to be able to
improve Europe's defence effectiveness by eliminating unnecessary
duplication through seeking European, rather than national,
capabilities.</P>

<P>	The development of the common defence policy for the European
Union, like the United Kingdom's recent strategic defence review,
should be foreign policy led. The scale and the scope of the armed
forces would be determined by the objectives of foreign policy
developed within the CFSP, while ensuring that  members of the North
Atlantic Alliance could meet their NATO obligations.  This would not
lead to any decoupling of European countries from their NATO
undertakings.  Nor should there be any duplication of the critical
contribution to military co-operation provided by NATO, namely its
command structures and headquarters, although certain developments of
'double-hatting' could take place.  The most effective way for the
members of the European Union to "get more deployable forces for a
euro" is by systematically developing economies of scales in the
support, training and operational management of their armed forces. 
</P>

<P>	There are two approaches whereby duplication between European
armed forces could be eliminated  and additional resources  made
available for increased force effectiveness.  One would be in the
common development of new common capabilities, and the other is the
development of common support and logistic services.  An existing
Alliance example of the first approach is the common procurement and
operation by fourteen allies of the AWACS (airborne early warning and
control) aircraft.  An example of the second approach is the way that
four Nordic countries providing troops to IFOR/SFOR are supported by
a common logistic battalion.  The agreement by the Netherlands and
Belgian navies to develop common headquarters and support services
for their fleets is an hopeful sign that some European states have
made a start to the elimination of expensive duplication.</P>

<P>	In attempting to identify early candidates for common
procurement, the fact that the armed forces of different countries
want new tanks or new fighter aircraft at different times will be
raised as a major objection. This can best be solved by concentrating
on new projects on which there is a widely shared common requirement.
 The second approach will be a systematic analysis of support and
logistic services to see where these could be provided on a Europe
wide basis or for a group of countries procuring a common item of
equipment.</P>

<P>	An immediate example is the Medium Scale Transport Aircraft,
for which common tenders are being sought by seven European
countries, as well as the proposed large Strategic Air Lift projects.
These are two examples where common procurement and common operation
could be considered. A reduction in the number of operating bases
required would lead to much greater cost effectiveness.  These could
become early examples of European Force Elements.  The development of
a common European flight refuelling service could also be examined. 
In the longer term the common support and servicing of helicopters
could make sense. The Eurofighter, already ordered by five countries,
could provide a trial for a number of these concepts. </P>

<P>	In the marine environment one can cumulate existing capacities
and provide common supply services, possibly leading to a
rationalisation of the number of European naval bases.  Fleet
auxiliaries can be envisaged as developing a common European service.
 An early candidate as one of the European Force Elements, would be a
European mine counter measure service. The principle could be applied
to larger ships.  France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom all
wish to have some aircraft carrier capability; could it be provided
by a common squadron thereby providing savings in support and
logistic chains, while also ensuring that a viable force was
available at all times?  A European led Combined Joint Task Force in
the maritime environment at present lacks a satisfactory headquarters
ship; one, or more, of these could be acquired on a common basis.
</P>

<P>	It would make sense to begin the approach to land forces by
looking at engineers, communications, transport and medical services,
which could provide the first common programmes.  The wider field of
logistic support could follow and an early candidate would be the
development of common IT systems for logistics.  The question of
outsourcing logistic and support services is now under active
consideration in a number of European countries.  There would be
economies through the  working out of common specifications and the
use of a limited number of common suppliers.  Success in these areas
would enable a subsequent application of the approach of European
Force Elements to artillery, armour and infantry units.</P>

<P>	There are some force elements which are provided jointly
to&nbsp;all armed services.  Some of these, like protection against
nuclear, biological and chemical warfare, are obvious candidates for
common provision.  Others, such as intelligence and mapping, are more
difficult because of traditional transatlantic patterns of
co-operation, but it would be a mistake for the development of a
separable NATO for any capability to depend on a single ally, even
the United States.</P>

<P>	These examples suggest some areas where the development of
European Force Elements and common support and logistic services
could provide building blocks for the strengthening of European
defence capabilities by the more effective use of European defence
budgets through the removal of the cost overhang of separate support
systems.  We would need to develop common budgeting arrangements in
order to avoid concerns about countries getting a "free-ride". </P>

<P>	The time has now come to move forward with practical steps to
develop a European Defence Capability. It will take time, perhaps
many years, but a start must be made. It does not necessarily mean
greater expenditure: much can be done with better use of current
resources. If Europe is to be a strategic power in the 21st Century,
this work on defence capability must start now.</P>
