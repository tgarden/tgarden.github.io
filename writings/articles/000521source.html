<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The announcement by the Defence Secretary,
Geoff Hoon, on 23 May 2000 of some adjustments to the Sierra Leone
operation should be widely welcomed. The operation has been conducted
with great sensitivity, and is a good example of "foreign policy with
an ethical dimension". The UK forces are always on call for the
evacuation of British Citizens from trouble spots anywhere around the
world. When Sierra Leone seemed to be returning to anarchy and
atrocities, the UK Government rightly despatched forces to assist the
evacuation of its citizens. Interestingly, it was made clear that
this operation was for the benefit of all EU citizens trapped in the
country, not just for UK passport holders. Thus it would appear that
we are already conducting military operations on behalf of the EU
without any problem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Having secured the airport, and brought some
order to a very unstable situation, the British forces seem to be
putting heart back into both the Sierra Leone government forces and
the UN contingent. There is always a danger that too active a role by
Britain will be characterised as intervention by a previous Colonial
power. The use of training teams to advise indigenous forces is a
well practised method of avoiding such charges. The replacement of
the Paras by the Royal Marines will continue to reassure the
population that there is hope of stability and the return to the rule
of law. The training team will be able to give advice to government
forces on re-securing the rebel held areas, and to the UN forces on
contributing to the maintenance of order. This will all be helped by
the provision of necessary light arms and ammunition. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">It is unfortunate that some commentators are
trying to make mischief over the developments in the operation. The
military are only too aware of the dangers of "mission creep".
However, this is a case where UK forces can do real good in a part of
the world that has suffered unimaginable misery as a result of weak
government.</FONT></P>
