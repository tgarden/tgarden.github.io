			<h4>Book Review by Tim Garden</h4>

			<h3>America as Empire: Global Leader or Rogue Power? </h3>
			<h3>by Jim Garrison </h3>
			<h3>(Berrett Koehler, San Francisco 2004)&nbsp; 224pp &pound;12.22 from Amazon.com</h3>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Jim Garrison is an American who believes that there is still hope for the future of the world. He is the president of the State of the World Forum, which looks to develop policies for a more sustainable global civilization. He has established an extraordinary worldwide network of politicians, scientists, academics and NGO leaders to share ideas. For those that are interested, the website at www.commissiononglobalization.org is the place to go.&nbsp; As I review his new book, I have to declare an interest as one of his Commissioners on the project.</p>
			<p>The book takes as a given that the US is now a classic imperial power. It dominates the world militarily through its 647 military bases in over 40 countries, a navy which can project power in every ocean, and an air force deployed to six continents. It has intelligence capabilities in over 170 countries, and an ability to intercept global communications. It spends more on these military capabilities than the next 15 major powers combined. And it can do all this for just 3.5% of GDP, because of the strength of its economy. Garrison argues that this combination of military and economic power, coupled with scientific, technological and cultural global influence makes the US an unprecedented power for good or ill.</p>
			<p>To learn from history, he charts all the previous empires from Sumerian to Soviet, and judges their good points and their failures. The book is worth reading just for this fascinating survey of the ebb and flow of empire. He concludes that there is much for modern America to learn from the Romans. Their empire was similarly based on military and economic power, provided stability and law, and was sustained over a long period and a vast area. Like Americans, the Romans were deeply convinced of their manifest destiny.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Garrison argues that the durability of Rome was founded not simply on military might or economic gain, but on good governance. He believes that the new US empire must learn this lesson. He examines in detail the policies of the five Caesars from 96 A.D. to 180 A.D., which represents&nbsp; the &quot;longest period of continuous good governance in the history of the world&quot;. These Caesars understood that for Rome to endure they had to blend local politics with global politics and use imperial power for the common good.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>He argues that America now has to make a choice which will affect the future of the world. It may, in the politics of the war on terror, seek to consolidate long-term military dominance over the planet. Instead, it could use its unrivalled power to lead the world to the next generation of international norms and global institutions. He argues that the Iraq intervention has made this choice even clearer and more urgent.</p>
			<p>The United States established the League of Nations after the First World War, and the United Nations after the Second World War. Garrison believes that the US has a responsibility now to work with the world community in building the next iteration of global governance before another catastrophe overwhelms us. The book describes how it can be done, but leaves the reader with little hope that it will be well received by the current batch of Bush neo-conservatives. It is a work of extraordinary vision and breadth, and deserves to be widely read.</p>
