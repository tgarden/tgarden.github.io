<h1><span lang=EN-US>Introduction</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Let me start by
saying how honoured I feel to be invited to join such a distinguished cast for
this first quartet of Quinlan lectures. I am in the fortunate position of
having seen Michael Quinlan at work from within the Ministry of Defence, and it
is right that his great intellectual contribution to international security is
marked by these lectures which bear his name. Since his retirement from the MOD
and then from Ditchley, he has been a tireless contributor to the new strategic
debates that have blossomed since the end of the Cold War.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When Michael
Clark discussed possible topics for this series, he wanted me to draw on the work
that I have been doing over the past 4 years on European defence issues. Those
who have followed my analysis will know that I advocate much deeper integration
of military capabilities between EU member states than is contemplated by any
of the national governments. I shall use the opportunity of my Quinlan lecture
to bring together the various strands of arguments that lead me to this
politically difficult position.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In looking at
the world of the 21<sup>st</sup> Century, we are like all forecasters stuck
with extrapolating from the recent past into the distant future. Perhaps the
major factor which shapes the thoughts of the strategic studies community (and
many others) about the nature of this future world is the new unipolar<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>dominant<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>power position of the United States. I shall look at America
first, before turning to the nature of the developments in Europe as it becomes
more integrated in the economic field, and also as it becomes both richer and
larger. From there, I will try to plot the trends in US and EU relations and
interests from past common endeavours to today's mixed messages and to possible
future co-operation or competition. That will lead me to options for Europe, in
which I will try to outline the comparative risks of different possible
approaches.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The overarching
title of this series of lectures is &quot;The changing nature of warfare&quot;:
American thinking is at the heart of these changes ñ but as we now know so are
the fanatical followers of an extreme form of Islam.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h1><span lang=EN-US><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></h1>

<h1><span lang=EN-US>The nature of US Hyperpower </span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It is often
difficult to describe the effects of current US international policy without
appearing to be anti-American. This is unfortunate, because the world in
general, and Europe in particular, owes a great deal to the generosity and
farsightedness of generations of Americans. We meet on the very evening that
President Bush arrives in Berlin, perhaps to a very different welcome to the
one given to President Kennedy four decades earlier. US Foreign Policy is about
promoting the interests of the United States; but this is true for most
nations. Yet those US interests are served by having growing economies in
peaceful societies with which to trade. We are also fortunate to have a US
Constitution in which the Founding Fathers put in place some remarkably far-sighted
checks and balances. Nevertheless, there is a growing concern that this rich,
commercial, high technology, well-armed, superpower is minded to take ever less
notice of the views of other states or the constraints of the international
system, even if Secretary of State Colin Powell argues fiercely that this
perception is plain wrong.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The litany of
issues which are dividing America from the rest of the world is growing longer.
They include tariffs on steel, subsidies to farms, lack of interest in arms control
and environmental controls, coupled with antipathy to the International
Criminal Court. The lack of objectivity over Israel is another source concern,
as is the apparent unwillingness to use the international system .<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>US Hyperpower is
based on a number of inter-related elements. The internal factors include the
strong economy, a lack of focused internal dissent and perhaps a unique culture
of national certainty and pride. The external factors include a long history of
lack of threats from near neighbours, a lack of any global power of equal
capability, and a military machine which surpasses all other<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>nations. The scale of defence spending
and investment in new military technology is truly astonishing under the
circumstances of overwhelming superiority. That is not to say that the US
military is exempt from the difficulties of fast rising defence costs that
other nations suffer from. It has personnel retention, infrastructure and
equipment replacement<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>problems
like the rest of us, and these can be exacerbated by focus on high technology
future systems at the expenses of maintaining current operational capabilities.
But that said, for all the inefficiencies of military programmes, the US stands
in a different league of military capability from any other nation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Before 11
September 2001, it believed that its only large scale vulnerability on its own
territory came from the strategic nuclear capabilities of<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Russia and China, and potentially in
the future from proliferating states of concern. These could be addressed by
closer co-operation and arms control in the case of Russia, and by the use of
technology to provide defensive systems in the case of the proliferating states
and China. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Since the end of
the Cold War, the US has flexed its military might in a number of areas. Over
the last decade of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century, it was able to develop a new
perspective on the application of military power: one that was driven by
technology..<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Gulf War saw the
US in the lead of a large coalition operating with the full backing of the
United Nations to free Kuwait after invasion by Iraq. The shadows of the
Vietnam War were finally laid to rest as the USA demonstrated that its
investment in aerospace technology could produce a new way of fighting wars.
The remorseless prolonged air campaign meant that the ground operation could be
completed with virtually no casualties to the Allied forces. The theories of
generations of air power<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>enthusiasts seemed at last to have been proved. Yet at the time there
was no certainty of such a cost free operation. Subsequent experience in
Somalia showed that it was still possible for the US military might to be
thwarted by an unsophisticated enemy. The casualty free experience of the Gulf
War had set new political standards for the way US military operations were to
be conducted in operations which were not about defence of the homeland..
Precision air power was seen by some to have been the key enabler for the
Dayton agreement in Bosnia. In Kosovo, the doctrine had advanced to a stage where
the use of ground force in hostile territory was discounted by President
Clinton from the start of operations. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Each campaign
reinforced the message that air power, space systems and precision attack could
allow the US to intervene, change governments, right wrongs and celebrate the
American way without risking GI lives. At the same time this focus on
technology has widened the military capability gap between the US and the rest
of the world, which has had a profound effect on the practicality of Alliance
operations. The French Air Force found itself isolated in the Gulf War because
of it years away from NATO interoperability standards. A decade later, few
Allies were invited to the party in the air over Afghanistan because even the
ardent NATO allies were failing to keep abreast of the technical standards
needed to operate with the new US systems.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Allies are more about political and overflight or basing
support these days than about making a real military contribution to any
operation which the US leads. And if the US is not in the lead, it loses
interest rapidly. While post-conflict operations have been the big activity for
European nations and others over the last decade,<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>the US forces have been reluctant participants, and some
would say not too effective either. The nature and tactics of warfare have
changed for the United States; but its allies have been slow to accommodate to
these changes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h1><span lang=EN-US>The growth of the EU as a regional power </span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The European
Union has also changed in the decade since the end of the Cold War. Europe was
the region directly affected by the fall of the Berlin Wall, the end of the
Soviet Union and of the Warsaw Pact. It had lived with a very real and urgent
threat of the ultimately destructive war being fought across its territory, and
that threat disappeared faster than could ever have been imagined. The process
of integration continued particularly with the work towards monetary union. The
now 15 EU nations found themselves at peace with each other, growing more
prosperous, and looking towards enlarging their membership yet further to take
in the states of Central and Eastern Europe and further afield. The EU already
matches the US in terms of GDP, and will draw ahead as it enlarges. It is
already more populous. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>EU members have
learned a number of lessons during the decade of the 90's. For the 90s Europe
suddenly felt safer than it had in living memory. Defence budgets fell as the
worries of the Cold War were forgotten. Most operational combat forces fell by
between 30 and 40%. Some countries, like the UK, took the opportunity to
reshape their armed forces towards their interpretation of future needs. Here
we return to the difficulties of forecasting the future. Others, like Germany,
were slower to restructure. Germany had discovered the time and cost that it
took to carry out the reunification process. To an extent it still bears the
financial burden of its generous arrangement. This has given it a defence
squeeze from two different directions: lack of money and inappropriate military
structures. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yet Europe was
also discovering that it could operate in some aspects as a regional power.
Trade negotiations were much more effective when conducted at the EU level than
by individual states. The EU could restrain unfair practices from any part of
the world, and most particularly could face down the US<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>in trade disputes when necessary. But
the EU was still missing the essential qualification to be regarded as a
serious global power comparable to the US. Foreign and security policy remained
largely national activities. If Europe was threatened directly, then NATO was
still the forum to turn to. Coping with the disintegration of the former
Yugoslavia was not a great success story for the EU as a coherent security
organisation. Here was a part of Europe that was to give troubles for all EU
members states as it broke up. Yet the US was needed to drive through an
enforceable settlement in Bosnia; the US was needed to provide the major
warfare contribution to NATO's operation in Kosovo; and NATO remained in the
lead as Macedonia looked as though it might be destabilised. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h1><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>The EU Defence Capability<o:p></o:p></span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The EU found
itself with important regional interests in its backyard, but without the
diplomatic and military cohesion and strength to solve the difficult problems
of the region. A year after the election of a Labour government in the UK in
1997, there began an important policy development in Britain, that was able to
allow an advance progress on developing EU diplomatic and military power .
Previously, the UK position had always been unhelpful to any moves towards
greater co-operation on security policy by EU states. It was feared that this
would undermine NATO, and perhaps lead to a disengagement by the US in the
longer term. The Anglo-French summit at St Malo in late 1998 changed this
obstructive approach. The process over the following months led to a much more
enthusiastic and practical approach to European Defence Policy. The EU states
agreed at Helsinki to work towards specific goals to be able to bring together
military capabilities for particular operations, which were other than the NATO
task of territorial defence. These &quot;Petersberg Tasks&quot; might involve
humanitarian relief, peacekeeping, peace enforcement or conflict prevention. The
capability for Europe was sized to be up to 60,000 troops available to be<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>deployed in under two months and
sustainable for 12 months, with all the necessary air and sea power support. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The work on
developing this modest military capability for the EU is very important. At the
2000 Commitments Conference, EU members indicated what forces they were
prepared to make available at the required notice for EU authorised operations.
The absolute numbers offered were impressive ñ 100,000 troops, 400 combat
aircraft and 100 ships ñ but<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>the
packages were complex. From the UK, the army would provide either an Armoured
or Mechanised brigade, each of which could be sustained for at least a year; or
an Air Assault brigade which would be deployed for up to six months. Combat Support
enabling capabilities such as Artillery, and Short Range Air Defence, and
Attack Helicopters could be deployed in addition. The Navy has committed an
aircraft carrier, two nuclear powered submarines, four destroyers / frigates,
support vessels; and an amphibious task group, including one helicopter landing
platform and an amphibious brigade. The aircraft carrier, helicopter landing
platform and submarines could not necessarily be sustained continuously for a
whole year. In the air, the UK has offered up to 72 combat aircraft (including
Sea Harriers, which will now be phased out under national plans), with
associated support aircraft including strategic transport. This number would be
available for six months to cover initial theatre entry. For a longer term
commitment the total would reduce. As can be seen, the offer has constraints on
time that may not fully meet the Helsinki requirement, and other nations will
need to be able to fill the gaps.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But as the work
has continued, it has become clear that gaps in major enabling capabilities,
that had already been identified in NATO work under the Defence Capabilities
Initiative remain. There is no way to force member nations to provide expensive
shared capabilities for the benefit of EU operations. The list of these
deficiencies is long. They include such elements as the necessary air and sea
transport to deploy European forces with their equipment. There is insufficient
air to air refuelling support for all the military aircraft which might be
deployed on operations. While the Cold War has left us with many air defence
fighters, procured against the threat of Soviet bombers, Europe lacks the
precision all weather offensive capabilities that we have become used to in US
operations. Reconnaissance and Intelligence capabilities both at the strategic
and the tactical level are fragmented between nations even when they exist. Few
Europeans can plug directly into the operational data sources which US forces
are beginning to take for granted in any military operation at any level.
Deployable command and control capabilities are essential these days, and must
be able to link back to the operational headquarters which may be on the other
side of the world. If the use of air power is to be the preferred initial phase
for any conflict, the ability to suppress enemy air defences is crucial; and is
another missing piece in the jigsaw of European capabilities. Even secure
interoperable communications are less than universal. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>These and other
deficiencies were identified and governments agreed to rectify them in
Washington at the NATO summit of April 1999. Nothing of significance has
happened over the past 3 years. Now NATO is looking to reduce the list of 58
weaknesses to a handful, in the hope that members will at least address the
most important. A similar exercise in the Helsinki Headline Goal process is
trying to put pressure on EU members to fill these gaps. The approaches are
still fragmented. The lack of strategic air transport has been turned into a
question of European joint procurement rather than one of European joint
capability. The funding for the A400M project becomes the test of how strong a
nation supports European defence. Yet the capability is needed now, not at some
indeterminate time in the future. It is a low technology requirement which
could be filled by a range of solutions available on the market today.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><b>What can

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><b><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></b></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>EU
member states have agreed that they want to provide a serious military
capability to support their common foreign and security policy. European
members of NATO have agreed to address a range of shortcomings which have a 70%
overlap with the EU needs. Europe needs to be able to work with the USA in the
security field; and Europe also needs to be able to look after its own
interests when they do not align with those of the US. The institutions are
developing within the EU to manage these aspirations, and I hope deeply that
the Convention will start to address some of the difficulties of the
institutional barriers in the EU to coherent security policy. That may be
proved to be an optimistic hope. However, the good work in Justice and Home
Affairs that followed 11 September means that sovereignty issues can be
overcome when there is a pressing need. The question still to be answered is how
do we make some move on the capabilities issue? National defence budgets are
overstretched everywhere in Europe, and problems have sharpened since 11
September as new urgent priorities for security spending have been added. </span><span

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
normal cry from the defence specialist is that the Europeans must increase
defence spending. It is true that the EU nations in total are now spending less
half what the US spends on defence. Yet when they were spending 60% of US
defence spending at the time of Kosovo, they could provide less than 20% of the
effort for the air campaign. We get very poor value from European defence
spending. There are 15 armies, 14 air forces and 13 Navies, all with their
command structures, headquarters, logistics organisations, training
infrastructure. Some with similar equipment, others with quite different. All
are in decline as the effect of fast rising personnel and equipment costs take
their toll. If this was a multinational business, the answer would be self
evident. Streamline the company so that the overheads for small non-viable
branches could be covered by common services. Unless the Europeans start
rationalising their military capabilities now, they will individually and
progressively cease to have any useful global, and eventually even national,
role. In Britain, we have become used to the remorseless rationalisation
process in defence as our costs rise faster than normal domestic inflation.
After the SDR, we may have now approached the limits of rationalisation at the
national level. Germany has more national options than we do, as it still has
an internal rationalisation process to go through.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
smaller nations are moving down this path already as they lose capabilities.
The joint naval arrangement between the Dutch and the Belgians is a good
illustration of what is possible. Of course shared capabilities are not new.
The European members of NATO have been very happy with their supranational
AWACs force, which allowed an expensive key enabling capability to be jointly
operated. There are many things which we have today which could be pooled. Air
transport is a good example, and Germany has set up an organisation which could
manage such an arrangement. Again to produce capability and cost benefits, it
needs to be done with what is in place now, not on the back of some overpriced
long term European procurement plan. Much of the equipment which could be
pooled is American, because that is where common capabilities exist. Tactical
transport using C130s exists in 11 EU countries. The F16 in all its guises is
found across Europe. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of the great missed opportunities, both from the military and commercial<span

to pool the Eurofighter force. With a pooled force the support costs would be
much less, and the aircraft configuration control could be maintained unlike
the Tornado. It would also allow smaller European nations to buy a handful of
Eurofighters to add to a much larger force. The cost benefits between such a
Eurofighter buy, JSF or upgrades to F16 or F18s might work out very differently
then. </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";

if any of these rationalisation opportunities are to provide benefits to EU
defence, the savings must be ploughed back into filling the gaps in
capabilities. This is where it gets difficult. Everything that is currently
done on EU defence is a voluntary action by nations. This cannot continue if we
are serious about doing better. There must be some discipline in the process,
and this will in the end have to be about financial discipline. At an early
stage, the EU will need to be able to call on member states to contribute on a
fair basis to the common security needs. It will offer lower costs of
operations using pooled capabilities, but will require some of the savings to
fund the missing capabilities. The free rider problem will disappear when
contributions to the EU defence capability are required in capability or
cash.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
this rapid survey of the developing relations between the US hyperpower and its
economic partner, the European Union, I have tried to show that the military
security dimension is important for Europe. To be cast in the role of sweeper
up after America is not an enticing prospect. Without addressing the shortfalls
in military capability, we will find ourselves less and less able to operate
individually or collectively with the US to support our common interests. Nor
will we have a strong voice in where and how future operations are conducted.
Yet we will be expected to take on the post conflict tasks as our share of the
transatlantic burden. Kosovo was NATO's first and last war, and the future
arrangements will be much more about Europeans and Americans operating together
or separately. NATO will survive as a talk shop, and perhaps as a useful
organisation to set common military standards, but even the setting of
standards may decline if the technology gap becomes too great.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

national politics of much greater defence integration are difficult. But there
are opportunities which would produce more capability for lower cost with no
effect on sovereignty. Those benefits must be used to grow the missing European
enabling capabilities, and that will need the EU to control funds. The
&quot;European Army&quot; is used as the spectre to frighten the national
voters. In my view, there </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman";

what role for Europe in a world of US hyperpower? My answer is that we can have
a Europe that leaves the big decisions to America, and, when it can, Europe
helps to clear up afterwards. Or we can become more equal partners, able to
jointly address the problems of the world, and come to common solutions in
which we share the tasks. For the latter, we had better get serious about
producing a modern military capability.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
