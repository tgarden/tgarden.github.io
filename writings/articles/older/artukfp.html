<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">This is an interesting moment to take stock
of British foreign policy priorities. The new Labour government has
been in office for just three months and there has been a whirlwind
of policy agenda setting activity. I shall rapidly review what seem
to me the significant public pronouncements and the few examples of
policy in action, and try to draw out where, if there is, we seem to
have signs of new approaches.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Election &amp; Foreign
Policy</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Only one aspect of the United Kingdom's
foreign policy was an election issue, and that was Britain's approach
to the European Union. Interestingly, it was more of an issue within
one party, John Major's Conservatives, than perhaps it was between
the different parties. From manifestos and from the election
campaign, the voter had a choice of strongly pro-European Liberal
democrats, reasonably positive towards Europe Labour, and a
Conservative party which spanned a range of views from the pro to
those who would wish to remove the United Kingdom from membership of
the EU. For the remainder of the international scene, the interested
few could glean pointers from the manifestos, but there was no
foreign policy discussion for the average voter.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">The New Government's Mission
Statement</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">We cannot complain that the new government
has been slow to set its agenda for foreign affairs. On 12 May, just
11 days after the election, the new Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook,
staged a multimedia display in the grandest historic room of the FCO.
The contrast of the high tech launch of a Mission Statement with the
grandeur of the Locarno Suite seemed designed to symbolise a radical
and new approach. The question that needs to be answered is whether
the United Kingdom is really changing its foreign policy priorities,
or whether it is continuing much as before with rather more modern
presentational methods. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The new mission of the FCO is "to promote
the national interests of the United Kingdom and to contribute to a
strong world community". This is a mission statement which will cause
little surprise, and could be adapted to be used by Foreign
Ministries around the world. The mission statement then details four
benefits for Britain that will be secured: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<UL>
   <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">Security. We shall ensure the security
   of the UK and the Dependent Territories, and peace for our people
   by promoting international stability, fostering our defence
   alliances and promoting arms control actively.</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">Prosperity. We shall make maximum use of
   our overseas posts to promote trade abroad and boost jobs at home.
   </FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">Quality of Life. We shall work with
   others to protect the World's environment and to counter the
   menace of drugs, terrorism and crime.</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">Mutual Respect. We shall work through
   our international forums and bilateral relationships to spread the
   values of human rights, civil liberties and democracy which we
   demand for ourselves.</FONT>
</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">But it goes further than comfortable
phrases, it promises to secure five strategic aims within the first
five years of government.  These deal with Britain's role as a leader
in Europe, strengthening the Commonwealth (including improving the
prosperity of its members), making the UN more effective, increasing
respect and goodwill for Britain including using the British Council
and the BBC World Service to greater effect, and finally
strengthening relationships everywhere. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Like any good business plan, having set the
mission and given the longer term broad strategic aims, the
government then sets itself objectives for the 12 months ahead. The
immediate priorities are:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<UL>
   <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">the success of the British Presidency of
   the EU, by opening the doors to enlargement and completing the
   single market;</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">an enlarged NATO and strengthened
   security partnerships throughout Europe;</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">a successful transition in Hong Kong,
   which promotes its prosperity and preserves its freedoms;</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">an agreement on specific measures to
   protect the world's environment at the forthcoming UN
   conferences;</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">a productive Commonwealth Summit which
   promotes trade, investment and good government for all its
   members;</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">a deeper dialogue with the countries of
   Asia through a successful Asia Europe Summit;</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">a vigorous effort to develop our
   relations with key and emerging partners.</FONT>
</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Ethical Foreign Policy</FONT></B>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Since this agenda was set Robin Cook has
staged another major event at the FCO, where he has developed his
thinking on an ethical foreign policy. This took place just 3 weeks
ago and was entitled Human Rights into a New Century. In this major
speech, he made a strong case for the responsibility that the United
kingdom has to promote human rights. He repeated the manifesto
promise to reverse the decline in overseas aid, and trailed a new
White Paper from the newly formed Department of International
Development which would set out policies to tackle global poverty and
sustainable development.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">He then spelled out 12 policies that "put
into effect our commitment to human rights". These were:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<UL>
   <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">Supporting international measures
   against states which violate human rights - with Nigeria cited as
   an example;</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">Supporting international sanctions
   against states like Iraq;</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">Refusing to supply equipment and weapons
   to regimes which use them to deny human rights;</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">Measures to improve trade which does not
   undermine human rights - with child labour used as an
   example;</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">Using multilateral conferences to
   support measures critical of human rights abuses;</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">Supporting the work of NGOs such as
   Amnesty International;</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">Supporting the proposal for a permanent
   International Criminal Court;</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">Provide more resources to existing
   International Criminal Tribunals (with recent operation of SFOR
   against war criminals as an example of resolve);</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">Making sure military training assistance
   supports human rights objectives (with resources perhaps
   transferred to legal side);</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">Support to media under threat from
   totalitarian regimes;</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">Publish an annual report on UK
   activities to promote human rights;</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">Finally allow trade unions at GCHQ, the
   signals intelligence centre.</FONT>
</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"> It must be a full time job in the FCO
keeping track of the ever increasing number of objectives, and
monitoring their satisfactory completion. One particularly sensitive
area is that of arms sales. In the speech, he stated that "Britain
will refuse to supply the equipment and weapons with which regimes
deny the demands of their peoples for human rights". This is a
carefully worded statement, which does not prohibit the supply of
weapons to regimes with poor human rights records, if those weapons
are not used for internal repression. I shall come back to how that
is working out in practice.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">Monetary Union</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">At exactly the same time as the Foreign
Secretary was making his pitch on an ethical foreign policy to an
audience of media and NGO representatives at the FCO, Gordon Brown,
the Chancellor of the Exchequer, was making another speech at Chatham
House with very significant foreign policy implications. His lecture,
"Britain leading in Europe", was a plea for the public debate to
start in earnest on monetary union. While he set out the necessary
conditions for it to be in Britain's interests to join, it was clear
that the government expects to move public opinion towards favouring
EMU. He had already surprised the City by the rapidity with which he
had given the Bank of England operational independence from
government. It looks as though there will be a concerted effort to
co-operate with the development of EMU. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">Public Spending Review</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Chancellor has one other potential
effect on foreign policy, and that is in terms of the public spending
policy. Yet another review has been ordered where all departments
will be looked at in a Comprehensive Spending Review. It is not clear
yet how this may affect the foreign policy priorities, although there
are those within the FCO who hope for a rebalancing of resources, in
their favour, between defence and foreign office.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">Strategic Defence Review</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">This brings us to the question of the
Government's Strategic Defence Review. The Review was a manifesto
commitment and its nature was explained in a speech by George
Robertson, the Defence Secretary on 28 May 1997. He stated that it
would be "foreign policy led". He promised to continue to base
collective defence on NATO, and to maintain both strong conventional
forces and the nuclear deterrent. He announced that there would be
wide consultation including two major seminars with outside experts.
These were held in July, and for those of us who attended it was
clear from both the Foreign and Defence Secretaries that they saw
Britain continuing to "punch above its weight".  The Review reports
at the end of the year, and will be interesting to see how it meshes
with the spending review which goes on in parallel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">Foreign Policy in Practice</FONT></B>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The early months of government have not just
been about starting a series of reviews, although there have been an
extraordinary number. There have also been external events to test
the foreign policy objectives. The European Union had its major
meeting with the Council in Amsterdam in June, and as usual all
leaders declared it a triumph. Commentators were less enthusiastic
about the practical achievements, but it did at least allow the new
government to show that it wished to be engaged in Europe. At the
same time Tony Blair reported back to Parliament his "success" in
protecting the UK's interests over immigration, foreign policy and
defence. This seemed like little change from the previous
administration's approach which had to been to ensure that UK foreign
policy was not determined by Brussels, and that NATO was not weakened
at the expense of the WEU. Nevertheless, the setting out of Agenda
2000 by Jacques Santer has laid out an adventurous plan for the
expansion of the European Union, and the British government appears
to be keen to move ahead with this.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">On the NATO front, the run-up to the Madrid
conference in July had some difficult negotiations. The aspirant new
members were lobbying hard and a division arose over whether to go
for just three new members (Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic)
as the United States wanted, or to extend it to include Slovenia and
Romania as a number of European states (in particular France) wanted.
Very unusually, diplomatic efforts had not resolved the questions
before the meetings of the Heads of States. The United Kingdom found
itself in its traditional role of supporting the United States,
though in this case from the logic of the position perhaps as much as
any special relationship. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Denver summit was an opportunity to
parade the new concern for global issues and particularly the
environment. Unfortunately, it was hardly a successful conference for
advancing the cause.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The handover of Hong Kong was another event
which might have caused difficulty for the new government,
particularly with its strong push on human rights. In the event, it
went off without difficulty apart from the torrential rain. We have
yet to see how relationships with China will develop. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Arms sales contracts are also events which
test the seriousness of the Labour government's approach to ethical
foreign policy. An early start was made with the banning of
landmines. Although the effectiveness of this was reduced by allowing
their retention by British forces for the next few years, for use in
emergency with ministerial approval. A tough line was taken on all
trading with Burma. Last week, the decision on sales to Indonesia
were announced. Hawk aircraft (very expensive) are apparently
allowable, and to greater surprise so were armoured vehicles and
water cannons. Following the announcement that the exports were to go
ahead, Robin Cook on 28 July announced his "new criteria  to ensure
responsible arms trade". The opening sentence of this announcement is
"Britain is one of the largest arms exporters in the world". Some of
the press comment has suggested that it is this fact which is already
modifying the idealism of the ethical foreign policy. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">Changes in Style or Content?</FONT></B>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">So what are we to deduce from this early
evidence? Are there any real changes in Britain's foreign policy, or
is it just a change in style? Not surprisingly the most obvious
change is in its approach to the European Union. There seems to be a
reasonably strong feeling throughout the leadership that it is in
Britain's best long term interests to be in Europe and acting as a
leading nation. This will include relatively early membership of
monetary union if it comes about and is successful. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The most interesting aspect of foreign
policy that strikes the writer is the virtual absence of the United
States from the documents. The FCO Web site still promotes the
transatlantic relationship as a key theme, but it is a shadow of the
line taken by Malcolm Rifkind, the previous Foreign Secretary. We had
long grown used to Foreign Policy statements starting with a ritual
reminder of the particular place that the United States has with
respect to Britain. For some, it was that relationship which was
damaging to Britain's attempts to become more European. Yet in
security matters, NATO (and thus the United States) is seen as
critical. It was perhaps strange that so little support came from the
new government towards a European defence policy development at
Amsterdam. Yet at the same time Tony Blair is obviously comfortable
bathing in the reflected glory of a close relationship with the US
President at a personal level. There are also signs that the
Commonwealth's star may be beginning to rise.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">At present we have a government that has set
down some worthy markers, yet policy whether in arms sales,
relationship with the US, or with China, or furthering of the
Maastricht treaty does not seem to have changed greatly. It will 
work hard on the electorate to move them towards a more pro-European
frame of mind. Its relationship with Asia is likely to continue the
policy of co-operation of its predecessor, and there seems little
sign that a new ethical approach will affect commerce greatly.
Australia remains significant to the United Kingdom. Again, the visit
of the Prime Minister to London so soon after the election was a
happy piece of timing. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">Who Pays?</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The big question that remains is where the
funding for more overseas aid, more British Council, more BBC World
Service, less overstretch in the armed forces, an ethical arms
industry, and greater involvement in the international community will
come from. I shall be surprised if the strategic spending review
leads to the conclusion that Defence and the Foreign Office are going
to get more resources. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">As a footnote to this first look at how the
new government is shaping its foreign policy priorities, perhaps I
should mention an article in the Guardian of 26 July, entitled "Blair
as wizard of Oz". It suggested that Tony Blair might be an Australian
at heart: not in awe of the past; a meritocrat; a doer and a
practical, problem-solving politician, who is simply happy making his
own history. If that is true then he should have the understanding of
this audience  as he tries to square the circle between idealism and
the real world.</FONT></P>
