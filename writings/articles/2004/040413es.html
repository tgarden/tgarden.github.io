			<h4><b>Where is the Iraq Strategy?</b></h4>

			<p>Twelve months ago the world marvelled at the ease with which American forces took Baghdad. The Stalingrad-style war of attrition in the streets predicted by many failed to materialise. Yet one year on, a remarkable degree of strategic incompetence has now generated just that situation. As Tony Blair prepares for his meetings with UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and President George Bush this week, he needs to think very carefully about his strategy for influencing the Americans to stay the course in Iraq.</p>
			<p>Small-scale guerrilla operations by remnants of Saddam's forces have grown into widespread insurgency throughout the so-called Sunni triangle. The Shias, who have waited patiently for things to improve, have begun to take up arms. There is now a spiral of mob violence and hostage-taking. Even the appointed Iraqi Governing Council has begun to turn against its American patron. The challenges facing Mr Blair and Mr Bush are getting more daunting by the day.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Yet the strategic goal is clear: to turn Iraq into a democratic market economy that can rejoin the international community. This involves three key factors: politics, the economy and the security situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The politics require a legitimate process towards a constitution and representative government. The economy needs inward investment, rebuilding of infrastructure, and technical assistance. But neither of these will happen without better security.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;That is the only reason that American, British and other troops are there. It is easy to lose sight of this in what is being thought of more and more as a continuation of the war. Now commanders must consider whether their military operations are bringing a democratic Iraq closer or not.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;The British forces have for the most part used a &ldquo;soft&rdquo; process of engagement to build confidence in Basra, even when severely tested. Often a tactical retreat followed by negotiation can calm a difficult situation, such as the occupation of the Governor's offices there last week. However, when necessary they have been prepared to use deadly force in self defence.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;In the Sunni triangle, the military situation has been more testing. US forces have had to cope with daily casualties for most of the period of occupation. Even the heavily armoured Apache helicopter gunships have been brought down by insurgent ground fire. Falluja has become a full-scale urban battle zone.</p>
			<p>This relatively limited problem has been greatly worsened by the new development of armed Shia militias entering the fray. Their leader, Moqtada al-Sadr, has become an important figure - in part because of his demonisation by the US. The wave of violence in Kerbala, Kut, Nasiriya and even as far south as Basra followed the closing down of al-Sadr's newspaper.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;It is a standard guerrilla technique to incite heavy-handed reprisals by stronger occupying forces, thus generating wider support for the insurgents. But while the US forces&rsquo; status requires them to protect the Iraqi people, it seems that US commanders see themselves as simply being at war.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;They have shown little concern for the rising numbers of Iraqi dead and wounded. US use of air power and artillery to put down the Shia militias is leading to resentment, fear and anger in the towns that become targets. Firing deliberately on a mosque, as US forces did, fans the flames of opposition yet more. There can be little hope of working with the people of Iraq if the occupying forces treat them all as enemies rather than allies.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;Much significance is being attached to the changes due to take place on 30 June. Yet in practice the military situation is unlikely to change much. The Coalition Provisional Authority will become the US Embassy in Iraq. The US-selected Iraqi Governing Council will become the new transitional government. Coalition forces will nominally answer to the new Iraqi government, but no-one expects any significant change in their tactics.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;What then are the options to prevent the insurgency from getting worse, and to get the strategy for a democratic Iraq back on track?</p>
			<p>&nbsp;The three strands of political, economic and security improvement must all move ahead together, and quickly. The political process needs the UN to be engaged in providing expertise as well as legitimacy. Having lost months of possible progress after the tragic killing of UN representative Sergio Vieira de Mello, the US forces must provide better protection for Lakhdar Brahimi, the new UN envoy. He will need to bring together all the disparate Iraqi factions to agree a constitutional process, and move towards establishing institutions for democracy.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>On the economic side, it is not enough to match pre-war levels of provision for fresh water, power and fuel. Iraqis also need rapid progress to improve their quality of life. This means finding jobs for the unemployed - and there is no lack of work that needs to be done. There also needs to be better protection for those employed on reconstruction work, and for the infrastructure they are repairing.</p>
			<p>But neither the politics or the economics will work without better security &#150; and that means more troops and police on the ground. The use of air power for policing is not a sign of strength, but of weakness. It is being used to compensate for inadequate numbers of trained troops. While responsibility for security should transfer to Iraqi forces as quickly as possible, the reality is that training Iraqi police and military to operate under civilian authority cannot be done overnight. If we want avoid ending up with either an ineffectual or repressive Iraqi security force, we need to give them time to learn, and not put them in the front line too soon.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>That means more multinational forces. Keeping tired troops back from their well-earned trip home, as is currently proposed, is a recipe for further disaster. By engaging the international community, through the UN, we should look to broaden the contributors. Meanwhile, the architects of the situation, the US, Britain and Australia, will have to dig deep into their military and police capabilities to meet their obligations.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;This is the hard case that Mr Blair must make to Mr Bush, whose election campaign team would doubtless prefer fewer US troops in the firing line this November. But the Prime Minister cannot afford to fail.</p>
			<p>Mr Blair&rsquo;s judgment was flawed over the invasion of Iraq. Subsequently, he has allowed British advice in Iraq to be repeatedly ignored without protest. Now that both the future of Iraq and the safety of British forces are at risk, he must stand up to his American friends. If he cannot influence them, we will all suffer as the Iraqi situation worsens &#150; above all, if withdrawal and chaos eventually become the only options.</p>
