<P>Introduction</P>

<P>Let me start with a health warning. I was asked to give a military
view on European Defence &amp; Security in the future and was happy
to accept on the basis of Chatham House rules. While I am of course
involved in the planning of the new force structures, we are still
very much in the formative stage - and the ideas that I will give
today are my views rather than MOD policy. In that light, let me
start with a riddle:</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>What rolls which ever way you push it; has a shiny plastic outside
and a very bland taste when you cut into it? EDAM of course - that
very appropriate acronym for European Defence after Maastricht. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>We are in a time of extraordinary change, and in many ways the
favoured military response would be to sit tight until the new world
order was rather clearer. But that is not an option. The nature of
the classic post war threat has changed fundamentally, the power
balances are changing as we speak, and the military structures we
currently have are less than appropriate for the new requirements. I
shall give you first a military view of what security problems give
me cause for concern - what we would have called the threat in the
old days. Then I will consider the organisations available and
appropriate to manage these security concerns. From there, I will try
to deduce what military structures, if any, are necessary and
relevant. Perhaps then I can test my thesis with a few examples of
how future crises could be managed.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>New Security Context - Threats and Organisations</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>So what is the new security context? There is now no Warsaw Pact,
no Soviet Union, no divided Germany, no risk of mass action across
the centre of Europe at 48 hours notice. There is a spread of
democracy towards the East, a spirit of cooperation within the arms
control negotiations, exchanges between NATO and ex Warsaw Pact
military men, the inclusion of ex WP countries in the North Atlantic
Cooperation Council, a gathering of confidence in Vienna among the
CSCE nations. There are even noises from some east European nations
about wishing to join NATO. So is it all over? Can we now depend on
much reduced forces all round to make a contribution to the odd UN
peacekeeping initiative? The question is for now rhetorical. At the
same time as all this theoretical peace and harmony is abounding, we
have a vicious war flaring up in Europe in Yugoslavia. We have the
fall out of the break up of the last great colonial empire of the
Soviet Union. This means that with the demise of the Soviet Union
superpower influence both externally and internally, we have the
prospect of a whole range of rising tensions and risks - ethnic,
religious, national - and these combine with the economic pressures
and in particular population growth and the need for resources. While
these should add up to much more local difficulties than the old
prospect of an East West world war 3 fought in Europe, the risks are
aggravated by the presence of all forms of weapons of mass
destruction left over from the cold war. To this we must add the
problems of the transfer of these weapons, nuclear, chemical,
biological and conventional to third world nations. When to this is
added the proliferation of ballistic missile technology, we find
Europe being potentially at threat from other areas of the world in
this uncertain future.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In all this, I am not trying to find new enemies, new threats and
new justifications for continuing the current high levels of
expenditure on defence in the West. What I am saying is that when we
consider threats to our interests, we are not out of the woods yet.
Europe has tensions in various parts which may lead to civil
disturbance, to local war and could suck in neighbouring territories.
I do not need to rehearse them all with you now. It also has economic
security interests beyond the European continent - particularly in
the Middle East - where instability remains the norm - and the spread
of Islam is another factor in this equation. Finally, there are
nations who might come to threaten Europe from a distance with ICBMs
in the not so distant future. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>If all this is true, what is the best way for Europe, and the UK,
to provide for security? If I can take it as read that collective
security is better (it is certainly cheaper) than trying to go it
alone, let us look at the ever expanding number of vehicles for that
collective defence. In no particular order, we need to consider NATO
as is, NATO expanded, WEU, CSCE, EC, UN, bi- or multi-lateral
arrangements and finally ad-hoc alliances. Of all of those only one
has an in-being functioning military organisation, with well
understood procedures, common training, and effective command and
control. That of course is NATO. So from a military man's point of
view, I would be very concerned if we did anything which put at risk
the NATO structure while moving towards some other new grouping. The
real significance of NATO is that has the infrastructure and the
range of military capability which can  be drawn on to manage a wide
range of crises today: no other organisation does. This does not mean
that any given operation has to be a NATO one. It means that the
benefits of standardisation of procedures can be transferred into any
one of the alternative forms of collective security. The Gulf war of
course showed this. Whether you wish  to classify it as an UN
operation or a US led ad-hoc alliance, the rules of the game were
NATO rules, the communications were NATO systems, and the ad-hoc
alliance could work only because so many of the members had trained
together in this way.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Of course we must make a greater European contribution to the
western collective defence effort in the future, but both because of
the importance of NATO, and for other more mundane technical reasons
(which I will come to), we must keep the US involved. So if I just
say a few words on each of the other organisations, it will be in
that light - keep NATO going until you can provide a military
operational alternative, and make sure that you can still call on the
US even then. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>So first what about an expanded NATO?. The NACC is not of course
that, but it is the first step towards involving other nations. While
the desires of Czechoslovakia and Hungary to slip under the NATO
umbrella are understandable, we cannot move quickly on such expansion
of commitment. If NATO expanded too quickly, it would break up under
the strain, or become more a debating forum than a military alliance.
What then of the WEU as an alternative? There are of course
attractions to a purely European based organisation - not least that
it would pull the French in more closely. When we look at structures
in a moment, I will try to see whether we can give WEU a greater
role, while keeping a military effective organisation. We must
however at the political level move in ways which do not increase the
isolationist tendency in the US. It is one of the ironies that the US
always believes that Europe should take on more of the burden of its
own defence, while worrying if it looks as though we are really going
to. Moving from WEU to a EC based defence organisation is I think
even more full of dangers. While the EC could take the lead on a
security issue and provide the basis for an alliance of security
forces, it does not have the structure to train and support a
standing force. It would of course call on members to use their NATO
trained forces. The CSCE would be an even more diffuse organisation
for military effectiveness. Its utility is as a pan-European forum
for achieving political answers to security concerns. That brings me
to the UN. We have perhaps seen a turning point in the effectiveness
of the UN with the new world order reflected in the security council.
The UN will have a difficult security role to play. Peacekeeping in
its traditional sense is possible with the somewhat rudimentary
military command and control arrangements, and no training. I would
suggest that peacemaking, deterrence and war fighting under the UN is
a different matter. As the Gulf showed, the UN provides the legal
framework for such operations, but the organisation for such military
operations is based on national or in that case NATO type procedures.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>So let me turn to my deductions about what sort of forces we need
as a result of this - and how we can fit them in to maintain NATO,
but also contribute to the other fora.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>National Military needs</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Each nation needs to provide forces for the direct security of its
territory from both internal and external threats - for the UK the
internal driver is of course Northern Ireland (a problem whose trend
line is not helpful). For basic territorial defence, we are well
situated geographically, and the now reduced air defence arrangements
should be sufficient. We have also the national nuclear capability as
a deterrent in the increasingly uncertain nuclear world.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Having taken care of direct national requirements - a contribution
to European collective defence is the next requirement. Here European
governments need to judge what is appropriate. It looks as though
each of main NATO players has come to similar decisions. Force
levels, well within the CFE requirements, and perhaps on average
about 20% lower in number than before, with reduced readiness states.
The US forces in Europe are of course reduced much more than this,
but that makes the continuation of reinforcement plans even more
important. Why 20% lower? Perhaps that is about the scale which keeps
defence budgets fairly static. For the UK, we have also seen the
reduction of Germany based forces, but we have kept the range of
capabilities across the spectrum of military operations. The
arguments that were made in the past for role specialisation in NATO
might now seem more valid than before with smaller forces. The
trouble is the nature of an ad hoc alliance is more uncertain and I
will deal with what sorts of capabilities we need in just a moment.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Thirdly, we need capabilities for use beyond Europe in areas
either of national or Western interest. These include the middle
east, but of course also for the UK include the vestiges of empire
and our responsibilities to British Citizens around the world.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Force Structures</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>So what sort of forces and structures do we need. The tasks are:
Internal security, territorial integrity, humanitarian aid, crisis
management, deterrence, war fighting from low to high intensity; and
all of these in a somewhat unpredictable alliance in an uncertain
location. I have dealt with the purely internal national requirements
calling for infantry and support for NI, air defence for the UK, and
a minimum strategic nuclear deterrent force. Looking to the first of
the external tasks we have the requirement for rapid deployment of
humanitarian aid. Military aircraft and troops employed on relief
operations can promote stability and security, and may resolve
distress which could lead to conflict before that stage is ever
approached. The examples are many. In recent years we have been
involved in such places as Ethiopia, Mexico, Colombia and Bangladesh
responding to the need for aid following famine, earthquake, flooding
or other natural disaster. The UN operation in Kurdistan following
the Gulf War is an example of the next stage up in such relief
operations. Here some military protection is necessary as well as the
relief of the starving and displaced Kurds. These operations are met
by military air transport, with an appropriate mix of fixed wing and
helicopters and armed troops.</P>

<P>Moving along this spectrum of crisis management, the surveillance
possible by air and space military systems can be a key to stability.
Arms control agreements and UN resolutions following conflict must 
be verifiable. Indeed air reconnaissance can provide both increased
confidence in compliance and a deterrent against non-compliance. In
this respect the role of aircraft in CFE verification and Open Skies
is in my view particularly important. Again, the movement of powerful
surveillance capabilities into a region can be used as a signal of
concern about the actions of a potential aggressor. </P>

<P>If conflict seems possible the rapid deployment of military power
becomes necessary. Here one build a sequence: air and ground defence
to secure the operating base; offensive air to achieve air supremacy;
ground forces to take the ground; naval forces if necessary to secure
the logistic supply routes. In all this I have not said where the
operation is happening, and in a sense it doesn't matter. If this is
the defence of some part of NATO, then the problem is easier, but
this sequence of deployment to the area of local difficulty is still
necessary. What nations send, whether in or out of area, is a measure
of their commitment. If I were to put a batting order out of the Gulf
experience: No 1 would be ground offensive troops - once you have
them in they are every difficult to bring home without a resolution
of the dispute. Next Offensive air, then defensive air, then
logistic/medical/engineering type support, then naval presence, then
money, then tacit support in the UN. If this analysis is correct, the
UK will need the range of those capabilities if it wants to be able
to play at any level. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The problem then is how do you set up an appropriate structure
within NATO to provide trained and ready forces to provide this sort
of capability. We need deployable trained forces which can be rapidly
integrated into the current in place structure in a NATO country for
a NATO operation - or can be flexible enough if deployed under
another banner be it WEU or UN or what have you. NATO has recognised
this by its moves now to a 3 tier structure of forces: Rapid
Reaction, Main Defence and augmentation. The rapid reaction forces
are the ones who can deploy to allow time for main defence forces to
be fully activated and to assist them in defending territory. For
non-NATO operations the capabilities implicit in the reaction forces
will be ideal. It is for this reason that trying to ensure that WEU
and NATO forces are double hatted is important. There remains however
the problem of France, and it make be that the Franco-German Corps is
a necessary complication to overcome this. However the very good
response from NATO nations to providing for the ARRC and the RF(AIR)
is most encouraging. It means that the NATO forces will be flexible
enough to employ in this increasingly uncertain world.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Conclusion</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>European security remains a problem even after the demise of the
Soviet superpower. The problem is not just from the instability in
many parts of Europe, but also an increasing threat from third world
nations to European security interests. The plethora of organisations
run the risk of undermining NATO, but NATO is the only vehicle to
produce effective military cooperation. The way NATO is restructuring
now is designed to provide much greater flexibility in how we tackle
future security problems.</P>
