<H3>Europe as a Strategic Power	</H3>

<P>	</P>

<P>	It is sometimes argued that there is no need to change the
current arrangements for security within Europe. NATO served the
continent well throughout the Cold War, and has reinvented itself to
adapt to the security needs of the post Cold War era. Indeed the
enlargement of NATO, the new strategic concept and the recognition of
the needs of a European Defence and Security Identity within NATO are
all a part of a new security structure for Europe. The question is
whether this process of development within the NATO structure is
sufficient for the future. In the last 10 years, Europe has seen its
security interests threatened, and a number of European nations have
been involved in high intensity military operations both within the
Continent and beyond. We now have the examples of the Gulf War,
Bosnia and Kosovo in a relatively short time to assess whether the
current security structures are likely to be adequate into the
future. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Europe is an economic power, but it is a long way from being a
strategic power. To be a strategic power requires two key elements: a
clear and coherent foreign policy, and the diplomatic and military
means to implement that foreign policy. Europe currently has neither.
For the 21st Century, it seems inconceivable that a region which is
as rich and populous as the United States can expect to continue its
foreign and security policy on either an exclusively  national basis
or only through NATO. The limitations of the European position were
highlighted by the Kosovo operation. Even for a tragedy so close,
Europe looked to the USA to provide the lead and the major military
capabilities. The USA had previously to take the lead in the Gulf and
also eventually in Bosnia. As a result, Europe must shape its
security strategy  always mindful of how it will play in the US
Congress. Looking to the longer term, NATO remains important, but
there is no guarantee that it will remain in existence for ever. Had
the Kosovo operation ended in failure, the future utility of NATO
would have been very much in doubt. There will doubtless be other
tests of Alliance cohesion in the years ahead.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Improving  European Capability</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	The question  is how  to develop a European Foreign and
Security Policy which is underpinned by the necessary diplomatic and
military capability to implement it. We need a design which maintains
and supports NATO but gives us a European capability to protect and
promote European vital interests.	The arguments too often revolve
around the institutional debates. The linkages between NATO, WEU, and
the EU, coupled with debates over second and fourth pillars, do
little to advance the military capability available to Europe. The
institutional framework is important but it is nothing without the
military and diplomatic capability to underpin it. Too often the
institutional debate revolves around how to give Europe a greater
voice in the deployment of US assets. What needs to be addressed is
how to provide more European useful capability, and then how it
should be organised in both a NATO and an EU context.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>		A recent analysis by the Brookings Institution claims that
despite spending two thirds of what the United States does on
defence, European NATO countries have less than 10 per cent of the
transportable defense capability for prompt long range action. In the
Kosovo operation, we have seen an overwhelming reliance on US
capability, with the European nations each providing  relatively
small force contributions. While the data of the breakdown of
missions between nations has yet to be published, it is clear that
the US provided just over half the total missions; but a considerably
higher proportion of the bombs dropped on targets.  Hopes for fixing
the problems of European defence capability currently centre on each
nation modernising their military on a national basis. Each nation is
expected to transform its forces into rapidly deployable smaller more
flexible units tailored to peace enforcement. While this would
certainly offer some extra resources for the types of operation which
are currently being undertaken, it would not greatly improve the
total defence capability that Europe obtains for its vast expenditure
of defence.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Ideally the development of the common defence policy for the
European Union, like the United Kingdom's recent strategic defence
review, should be foreign policy led. The scale and the scope of the
armed forces would be determined by the objectives of foreign policy
developed within the CFSP, while ensuring that  members of the North
Atlantic Alliance could meet their NATO obligations.  This would not
lead to any decoupling of European countries from their NATO
undertakings.  Nor should there be any duplication of the critical
contribution to military co-operation provided by NATO, namely its
command structures and headquarters, although certain developments of
double-hatting could take place.  The most effective way for the
members of the European Union to get more deployable forces for a
euro is by systematically developing economies of scales in the
support, training and operational management of their armed forces. 
</P>

<H3>Current Examples of Integration</H3>

<P>	There are two approaches whereby duplication between European
armed forces could be eliminated  and additional resources  made
available for increased force effectiveness.  One would be in the
development of new common capabilities, and the other is the
development of common support and logistic services.  An existing
Alliance example of the first approach is the common procurement and
operation by fourteen allies of the AWACS (airborne early warning and
control) aircraft.  An example of the second approach is the way that
four Nordic countries providing troops to IFOR/SFOR are supported by
a common logistic battalion.  The agreement by the Netherlands and
Belgian navies to develop common headquarters and support services
for their fleets is a hopeful sign that some European states have
made a start to the elimination of expensive duplication. Already
this approach is allowing greater military capability to be deployed.
While the Dutch and the Belgian planners would individually be
reluctant to offer an unlimited deployment of a frigate for
operations, they can now arrange to share a task with a roulement of
forces between themselves. The management of the force from a shared
headquarters results in a greater military capability at no extra
cost.</P>

<P>	The inefficiencies of the national approach to defence within
European states is widely recognised. Some argue that the most
effective way to tackle it is through common procurement and perhaps
greater integration of European defence industries. Attempts at both
elements have not always been successful in the past. Recent
experience in procurement of an Anglo-French frigate shows how
difficult it is to see such projects through successfully. Moreover,
the defence industries are reluctant to be integrated by European
fiat. They look to partnerships which improve their shareholder
value. This may in any case be a better approach as it is likely to
improve competition and hence value for money. Nevertheless, there
will be opportunities for sensible common procurement where there is
a widely shared common requirement, and it makes sense to try to
exploit these where it can reduce procurement costs.  </P>

<H3>Early Opportunities for Initiatives</H3>

<P>	An immediate opportunity to explore common procurement is the
Medium Scale Transport Aircraft, for which common tenders are being
sought by seven European countries. There is also a need for large
strategic air lift capability which could be approached jointly.
These are two examples where after common procurement, common
operation could be considered. If operated as a European force, a
reduction in the number of operating bases required would lead to
much greater cost effectiveness.  These could become early examples
of European Force Elements.  The development of a common European
flight refuelling service could also be examined.  In the longer term
the common support and servicing of helicopters could make sense. 
</P>

<P>The Eurofighter, already ordered by five countries, could provide
a trial for a number of these concepts.  If Europe moved towards the
American large airbase concept, we might perhaps  imagine an
operationally ready force of some 400 Eurofighters made up of 20
multinational squadrons distributed over as few as five airbases.  In
addition an operational training base on a sixth airfield would be
required.  The training base could also provide a home for the
European Union Eurofighter HQ. The operating costs would be much less
than the planned national arrangements, even if the traditionally
smaller European airbases were retained.   The key to success would
be the application of common training, procedures and aircraft
modification programmes.  By making each unit truly multinational and
by developing the overall common operational policy through the EU
HQ, the problems of  national divergence could be eliminated.</P>

<P>	In the marine environment, one can cumulate existing capacities
and provide common supply services, possibly leading to a
rationalisation of the number of European naval bases.  Fleet
auxiliaries can be envisaged as developing a common European service.
 An early candidate as one of the European Force Elements, would be a
European mine counter measure service. The principle could be applied
to larger ships.  France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom all
wish to have some aircraft carrier capability; could it be provided
by a common squadron thereby providing savings in support and
logistic chains, while also ensuring that a viable force was
available at all times?  A European led Combined Joint Task Force in
the maritime environment at present lacks a satisfactory headquarters
ship; one, or more, of these could be acquired on a common basis.
</P>

<P>	It would make sense to begin the approach to land forces by
looking at engineers, communications, transport and medical services,
which could provide the first common programmes.  The wider field of
logistic support could follow and an early candidate would be the
development of common IT systems for logistics.  The question of
outsourcing logistic and support services is now under active
consideration in a number of European countries.  There would be
economies through the  working out of common specifications and the
use of a limited number of common suppliers.  Success in these areas
would enable a subsequent application of the approach of European
Force Elements to artillery, armour and infantry units.</P>

<P>	There are some force elements which are provided jointly
to&nbsp;all armed services.  Some of these, like protection against
nuclear, biological and chemical warfare, are obvious candidates for
common provision.  Others, such as intelligence and mapping, are more
difficult because of traditional transatlantic patterns of
co-operation, but it would be a mistake for the development of a
separable NATO for any capability to depend on a single ally, even
the United States.</P>

<H3>The Need for a European Defence Budget</H3>

<P>	These examples suggest some practical areas where the
development of European Force Elements and common support and
logistic services could provide building blocks for the strengthening
of European defence capabilities. They would make more effective use
of European defence budgets through the removal of the cost overhang
of separate support systems. Valuable as such individual initiatives
would be, they would not by themselves represent a coherent new
security structure for  Europe. They would however illustrate how
significant improvements in effectiveness could be achieved through
merging particular national capabilities and sharing common services.
</P>

<P>	For this approach to become coherent, it would be necessary to
develop a planning and budgetary system at the European level. The
ultimate requirement would be for a European Defence Budget. Under
such a system EU members would provide either defence capability or
money as their contribution. This would have a number of beneficial
effects: not only would the free ride be stopped, but nations would
probably prefer to improve their military capabilities rather than to
contribute money to the employment and industries of other nations. A
virtuous circle of improved military capability and effective
European defence could be established. There would be many problems
in assessing the true worth of each contribution, but the process
would also make the planning and audit at the European level more
effective.</P>

<H3>The Long Term European Goal</H3>

<P>	These suggestions do not move into the much more sensitive area
of national allegiances.  Servicemen and women would still be
recruited, given basic training, and paid by national governments to
whom their basic loyalty would remain.  In any event those nations
with defence commitments beyond NATO, such as France and the United
Kingdom, would continue to maintain the necessary independent
capability in some areas despite the additional costs.  For others
the opportunity costs of continuing a policy of conscription will
need to be addressed.  The issues in these areas, which would take a
common defence policy even further, may have to be addressed at some
stage but are not on the immediate agenda.</P>

<P>	The long term goal might be a true European Defence Capability
which would make for an equal partnership with the United States
within NATO. Even if such a regional approach proves too difficult
politically, the implementation of some sensible measures of closer
integration of particular capabilities could provide more effective
forces at no greater cost. The institutional structures to support
such an approach would develop in parallel through the EU High
Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy. </P>
