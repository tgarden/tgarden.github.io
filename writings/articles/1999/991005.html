<H3>Forecasting the Future</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>If you have been to Paris this year, you will have seen the
display of days to go to the Millennium on the Eiffel Tower. I was
there last month as we saw it tick over to less than 100 days from
the 21st Century. This should mean that forecasting what the world is
going to be like in the next century is getting easier.
Unfortunately, crises, both natural and manmade, emerge so rapidly
that predictions are upset almost as soon as they are made. Putting
together my thoughts, last month, I identified Taiwan as a key global
issue in its future relations with China and its  position in global
markets. Yet within days, Taiwan faced a different crisis as it coped
with the worst earthquake for a hundred years. Similarly, thinking
about nuclear threats to Japan, I had in mind missiles from Korea
rather than workers mixing enriched Uranium with nitric acid in a
bucket in such large quantities that a critical nuclear reaction was
achieved.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Even without earthquakes and homemade nuclear fission, looking
to the future is always a somewhat hazardous affair. We extrapolate
from recent experience into the unknown, often coming to quite
incorrect conclusions. So perhaps what I am going to say should be
seen as merely one possible future, and like all security
specialists, there may be a touch of worst case analysis, so that we
can prepare and prevent it coming to pass. Through recent years, we
have seen many predictions of the rise of Asia as an economic power,
coupled with a possible decline in Europe and North America. Through
much of the Cold War, we at times seemed to think that Communism was
unstoppable except by military means:that developing countries would
fall like dominoes if not afforded the protection of the West.
Sometimes, we see similar views being expressed but with Islam
replacing communism as the new unstoppable ideology. Yet the
experience of the almost simultaneous widespread death of ideological
communism at the end of the 80s, coupled with the fall of Asian
markets in the 90s have together given rise to an equally dangerous
presumption. There is  a complacency in some parts of America and
Europe that liberal democracies and market forces are the unstoppable
models which will spread peace, harmony and wealth throughout the
globe. We may all hope that this will be the case, but it is not yet
proven.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>A New Approach to World Security</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P> Nevertheless, we may be able to dimly see a new pattern of
international affairs emerging, which may in the end prove to be a
footnote in history, or, as I shall argue, a watershed. This new
pattern will have a profound effect on peace and security for the
World in the coming years. The 90s have been an interesting decade.
The end of the Cold War, the reunification of Germany, the
dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union, and the
accession this year of Poland, Czech Republic and Hungary into NATO
have completely transformed Europe's security. The UK has not been
safer from attack on its territory at any time in living memory. It
might have been assumed that the disappearance of a real and urgent
military threat from the Soviet Union would have decreased the
military activity of western European nations. Yet European armed
forces have been engaged in more real military operations in this
decade than they were in the four decades of the Cold War. It is as
though the Cold War gave western democracies an excuse for inaction. 
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	The Gulf War of 1991 set the new agenda for the international
community. That it was possible to assemble so many participating
nations into the ad hoc coalition was of course made easier by the
obvious breach in international law of the invasion of Kuwait. The
success of the Gulf War boosted the confidence of the international
community, that it could right international wrongs. The effects of
the break-up of the Former Republic of Yugoslavia are not yet
finished. Nevertheless Bosnia and Kosovo have further reinforced a
US/European view of how instability can be contained. The threat and,
if necessary, use of force is now less constrained if the aims of the
operation are judged by the major western powers to be the promoting
of justice for individuals. East Timor  is a new adventure.</P>

<P>The previous embargo on intervention in the internal affairs of
states has been lifted. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	In the UK, our newly elected government in 1997 astonished many
by announcing that foreign policy would have an ethical dimension.
Britain had always been seen as essentially a pragmatic operator on
the international scene. Foreign policy was the promotion of national
interest by diplomatic effort with few absolutes.  As with many of
its policies New Labour was in tune with the times. Kosovo was a
humanitarian intervention. A number of speakers for the far Left and
the far Right have pointed out, there was no direct UK national
interest in the internal arrangements of Kosovo. Such voices were in
the minority. Humanitarian action has been cited in the past as a
justification for military action, but usually in retrospect or in
concert with more traditional justifications of vital interests.
Kosovo was different. With a pretty arguable UN authority, NATO
nations undertook an air campaign with a stated humanitarian aim.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	There are other straws in the wind. The establishment of the
International Criminal Court is one. The indictment of General
Pinochet is another. The steady arrest of people for war crimes in
Bosnia is a third.I would argue that this is the start of a new
dimension to international relations which will have implications for
global security. It is of course possible to argue that none of this
is new. Indeed the protection of human rights is fundamental to the
United Nations. That may be true in treaty language, but the reality
has been far short of it over the years.  The first change for the
new millennium may then be a much greater emphasis on human and
individual rights by the major democratic powers. If this is so, then
there are some fairly major implications for how we deal with a
number of places around the world- not least China, but I shall
return to this in a moment. For security is not just about military
and diplomatic activity. Many of the world's problems stem from other
factors, and in particular from economic issues.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Economics &amp; Security</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	We seem for the moment to have survived the Asian markets
crisis with confidence on the mend. Yet economic issues shape our
security thinking. The moves we are making in Europe towards an
integrated economic structure are inevitably leading to debate on the
next stage of foreign policy and security integration. Our economic
competition with the US, and of course the Asian competition with the
US, will have implications for the military support that we can both
(Europe and Asia) expect in the future from America. The economy of
Russia is a security issue for us in Europe . Most of all the
economic success of the US is a key to the sort of world we can
expect. There is no reason to assume that the US has managed to break
out of the cycles of growth and depression, however much the
investment analysts might want to believe it. The internet stocks of
today may be the tulips or south sea investment opportunities of
yesterday.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Global markets give a global interdependence. Again economists
are still arguing whether this gives the global economy a new
robustness or a new vulnerability. The rapid recovery of the Asian
markets is seen as a sign of the benefits of global markets - but
there are those that would argue that the current recovery has slowed
the market reforms that were needed in Asia in general, and Japan in
particular, thus setting the world up for a deeper depression when
the next fall comes. What no one disputes is the importance of Asian
economies to the  rest of the world's markets. Financial crashes,
corruption and crime can give rise quite rapidly to instability.
Albania was destablised by pyramid selling schemes which required a
European intervention force. Russia seems to be drifting deeper into
financial chaos, which may lead to political chaos. Riots in
Indonesia, anti-democratic moves in Malaysia, tensions in Korea, all
stemmed from the financial meltdown in the region two years ago. So
economic stability is important for global security, and both are
affected by another major world issue - that of population.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Population Growth</H3>

<P> </P>

<P>	India passed the one billion people mark sometime in August
1999. Together with China, it represents a third of the world's
population. Growth rates are declining everywhere, yet for the
developing world they remain positive. The world's population looks
set to stabilise and even start to decline by the end of the next
century, but in the meantime there will have been some significant
demographic changes. India will probably become the most populous
country around 2030. The European countries may be having a different
sort of population crisis if they continue to have negative growth
rates. The divide between rich and poor states may be magnified by
these differential population growth rates. All of these strains,
with their security implications may be further exacerbated by
environmental problems. Economic refugees as well as political
refugees are already a security issue for many countries. I was
interested to hear from a senior Swiss diplomat that Switzerland was
having to think about its lofty neutrality after Kosovo. The massive
influx of refugees into the country, showed that Switzerland had a
direct security interest in the future of the Balkans.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Environment, Resources &amp; Energy</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Environmental issues are becoming a growing part of the wider
definition of security. Global warming may affect available land in
places like Bangladesh. It may affect food availability in developing
countries more adversely.  Pollution of air or water can become a
threat to neighbours. Availability of fresh water is another growing
cause of friction between states. The forest fires of Indonesia
hardly help relations with its neighbours, but may also have wider
implications for the atmosphere - as is of course also the case with
the Brazilian rain forests. We have seen that industrial fishing can
take fish stocks below the level of viability. The Labrador fisheries
are now dead. Again this can be a source for conflict. The intensity
of commercial operations, the need for fresh water, the growing
populations and the need to raise living standards are problems which
come together across much of  the poorer parts of the world.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	It will not be possible for the rich nations to hold back the
aspirations of the poor nations. Yet the consequences in terms of
just energy requirements are of great concern. We shall need to look
at ways of providing the necessary energy without the burning of
carbon - and that probably means a renaissance of nuclear energy,
which brings with another series of potential problems, even without
the recent Japanese accident, not least in terms of the availability
of the necessary materials for nuclear weapons.</P>

<H3>Disease - Natural and Man-made</H3>

<P>Speaking here at the Nuffield Trust, I would be wrong not to
mention the security implications of disease. We may have passed
through a relatively golden age this century in terms of the tools to
fight disease. Aids and TB are taking their toll. Malaria areas will
increase with global warming. This would be reason for concern
enough, but to it we must add the growing perception of  biological
weapons as the poor man's nuclear bomb. Even in the old fashioned
anthrax aerosol, this prospect is causing great alarm, and
considerable expenditure, in the US. If you add the prospect of
genetic modification to the design of biological warfare, you have a
very bleak prospect for the future.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Weapons of Mass Destruction</H3>

<P>	We rightly feel much less at risk from nuclear weapons today
than we did through the Cold War period. It is certainly true that
there are far fewer nuclear warheads now than there were in the
1980s. But there are still an enormous number held by the US and
Russia. Russia is a particular problem with a decaying military
infrastructure, it is by no means clear that control of the tactical
nuclear weapon arsenal can be maintained.	</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P> 	India and Pakistan have been nuclear weapon states for a long
time, but neither had previously felt it necessary to declare
themselves as such. The optimist would argue that they have improved
deterrence by their tests; the pessimists would say that they are
their systems are not well controlled and a nuclear war has become
more likely. North Korea has been working hard to achieve a nuclear
capability. It has almost certainly a biological and chemical
capability, and the targets in South Korea are not difficult to
reach. Of great concern has been its recent involvement of Japan by
testing its new missiles in that direction. Japan must be feeling
increasingly beleaguered both with this and internal threats. The
cult, who used sarin gas in the Tokyo underground, had also tried to
get samples of the ebola virus for biological attacks. Japan will
also worry about the China - Taiwan situation.</P>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>China as a Major Power</H3>

<P>	It appears that China is having a considerable internal debate
over how to handle Taiwan. If it were to attack, it would place not
just the United States but also Europe in a very interesting
position. The states that came together to throw Iraq out of Kuwait
are also largely the same states that went to war in Kosovo for human
rights. Taiwan is a vibrant democratic place with a great deal of
commercial activity in America and Europe. China continues to fall
far short of the norms of human rights that the world community now
expects. It is difficult to see how the states who fought for the
Kosovar Albanians could stand by and watch the military conquest of
Taiwan. The consequences of such a confrontation are incalculable.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Indeed in any look to the future the developments in China are
key. The West often seems to work on the principle of hope rather
than realism. We are in a difficult period at the moment where the US
is becoming more cautious in its relationships with China, and China
is flexing its muscles. The parades  to celebrate 50 years of the
Peoples' Republic of China were very reminiscent of the shows of
military prowess much favoured by the Soviet Union in the Cold War.
Whether, this can be made even more difficult by a warming of
Sino-Russian relationships is questionable, and we see the first
joint military exercises now taking place. We should not forget that
whatever their economic situation both remain nuclear powers.</P>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>The decline in the power of States</H3>

<P>So is the future to be all fear and no hope? For addressing most
of these global security problems, individual States are no longer
able to act alone. Even the United States is constrained in what it
can do by itself,  and for a number of issues the US is a major part
of the problem. The United Nations is a wonderful ideal, but is much
hampered in practice. Work is needed to make it better able to meet
its obligations. Regional groupings should be effective in dealing
with local troubles. Of these groupings, the EU is the most mature,
but lacks a coherent foreign and security policy. If it were to
develop one, and the diplomatic and military tools to underpin such a
policy, it could be a very powerful agent for stability. In its
absence, NATO has taken on the role, but has a problem of legitimacy
for authorising interventions, and as we saw in Kosovo loses some of
its efficiency operating as a consensus organisation of 19 states.
Despite the best efforts of the international community to promote
multicultural liberal democracies, we seem to be developing a move
towards rights for ethnic, religious or cultural self determination,
whether in the former Yugoslavia or in East Timor. If this proves to
be the case, there will be a long queue of disputes, with the Kurds
near the top. Africa is still riven by civil warfare and ethnic
cleansing of the worst kind, and suffers from most of the other
troubles that I touched on:poor economy, high population growth
rates, disease, famine and corruption.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Hopes or Fears</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>As I said when I began, security specialists look at the black
side in order to give advice on how to prevent the worst case coming
to pass. There are many hopeful signs as we enter the new century.
The Cold War has ended. Economies are vibrant. Technology is allowing
individuals access to more information than ever before, and the
ability to operate on a global basis. International Law is beginning
to bring pressure to bear on abusers of human rights. Population
growth is declining. Environmental issues are recognised. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>There  are great reasons to be optimistic for the prospects of
greater peace and prosperity in the 21st Century, but only if people
and their governments face up to their global responsibilities. The
dangers are real and many if nations are fixed only on their own self
interest.</P>
