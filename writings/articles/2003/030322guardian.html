			<p><font size="-1">The reality of war is that it is about people dying. As the news comes in of the first casualties of this operation in Iraq, the politicians rehearse their messages of sympathy to the families of those killed. The remarks are undoubtedly sincerely meant, but are scarcely listened to by the wider public, and the families have much grieving ahead. In the military, we are used to handling unexpected death in peace as well as in war. Exercises, training and operations are always hazardous, and anyone who has spent some time in the modern armed forces will have lost friends and colleagues over the years. Like everything else in military life, there is a well tried system for managing such tragic events. <br>
					<br>
					The most urgent task after any death is to make sure that the next of kin are told of the circumstances as quickly as possible, and certainly before the news becomes public knowledge. With distant operations and the instant media coverage, this becomes ever more difficult.  Usually a senior officer from the  local unit will go to break the news  in person, and will leave someone to comfort the bereaved if there are more such visits to be made. The new arrangements for partners who are not married will ease some difficult situations that have occurred in less flexible times. The demands of the media for access can be insensitive but, for those within a military base, it is not too difficult to arrange privacy.<br>
					<br>
					In peacetime, deaths do not often come in large numbers. But each one is a tragedy for  families and colleagues. Now, we are having to face up to managing morale with the prospects of more numerous losses to our soldiers, sailors and airmen.  Casualties tend to hit particular units, and the effect can be considerable. The eight British marines who died in the helicopter crash in Kuwait, returning from their mission,  may only be the first of such tightly knit groups to experience such a loss.  The need to divide the support between a number of the bereaved can make it difficult.<br>
					<br>
					Untimely death is something which western nations have grown unused to. There has been an almost perverse pride that the British are more willing to take casualties than other nations. The &quot;body bag syndrome&quot; was used as a term of derision for perceived US unwillingness to take casualties after the Vietnam war. Their withdrawals from Lebanon and Somalia after sustaining losses were cited as examples of the need for casualty free operations. However, the same punditry claims that everything is different after the terror attacks on Washington and New York. America is at war and claims that it will do what is necessary regardless of the risk.<br>
					<br>
					The conduct of the Afghanistan campaign did not indicate any dramatic change in the US approach to risk. It is difficult to change your doctrine overnight when you equip to operate to particular defensive assumptions. In war, luck favours the bold.  Defense Secretary Rumsfeld wants to move away from large intervention forces that spend much of their effort on self-defence. We shall have to wait to see, whether smaller forces, coupled with new technologies, can deliver quick victory. Few would doubt that there is a greater risk of taking casualties with such an approach. <br>
					<br>
					The lasting lesson from Vietnam is that public opinion matters; and no government can afford to be seen as wasting young lives unnecessarily. A quick campaign has many advantages and reduces the risk of a rising public backlash against an increasing death toll; but paradoxically may bring more casualties while operations take place. None of us can know where the public threshold for unacceptable casualties sits today. The Somme would be impossible in the age of rolling news. Nor would the Bomber Command loss rates of the Second World War go unquestioned today. The Falklands showed that the British public was robust when the cause was popular. With the mixed mood about the war in Iraq, public acquiescence cannot be taken for granted in Britain. It may therefore mean that the British government, for once,  will need to be more cautious than its American allies. </font></p>
