<P>George Robertson has achieved the impossible in his first 18
months as Defence Secretary. He has produced a Strategic Defence
Review (SDR) which has met with critical acclaim from the Services,
the Foreign Office, NATO allies and defence academics. Even the
Treasury appear to have accepted it as realistic. The parliamentary 
debate on the SDR on 19/20 October 1998 focused almost exclusively on
the single issue of the future size and role of the Territorial Army.
Although this is a strong constituency issue for many MPs, it is
hardly the key strategic issue. Future European security must be the
prime concern of government.</P>

<P>Yet  as the House debated the SDR on very parochial issues, the
foreign policy assumptions that underpinned the Review seemed to be
under question from No 10. The next day, in an interview  with Philip
Webster of The Times, Tony Blair completely reversed his position on
the desirability of an EU defence capability. He trailed the line
that he would be taking the following weekend in Austria with fellow
European heads of government.  Britain would be in the lead in
developing thinking on how the EU could develop its defence
capability. </P>

<H4>Putting the US First</H4>

<P>The previous Conservative government  had an Atlanticist policy on
European security. It believed that NATO was the only organisation
that mattered, and that the Western European Union (WEU) needed to be
kept in its box. Anything which smacked of EU defence policy was seen
as putting at risk the cohesion and effectiveness of NATO, and, more
importantly, undermining the transatlantic bond. The new Labour
Government had given no indication of change in its manifesto, and
early statements seemed to reinforce the Atlantic Community approach
to foreign and security policy.  However, there was less emphasis on
the special position that the United States enjoyed in foreign policy
priorities. Robin Cook's Foreign Office Mission Statement  had
nothing to say about the importance of the United States. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Tony Blair returned from his first EU summit at Amsterdam jubilant
that he had beaten off those (France and Germany) seeking  to
strengthen the EU defence arrangements. As the Daily Telegraph  (18
June 1997) reported:  </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Facing the stiffest possible test of his negotiating skill at his
first full EU summit, Mr Blair insisted that he would not agree to
any "commitment" in the treaty to a WEU-EU merger. Europe's defence
should  remain a matter for Nato and not the EU, which had proved
itself unable to run a successful foreign policy.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>To launch the Strategic Defence Review, George Robertson and Robin
Cook held three  seminars of experts. At the first in July 1997 in
the Locarno Room at the FCO, Robin Cook listened for over 3 hours to 
various views about alternative foreign and security policy
priorities before delivering a homily on the importance of the UK as
a global player. He made it clear that getting into bed with Europe
for security arrangements was not high on his agenda.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Unsurprisingly, the Strategic Defence Review, when published in
July 1998 continued to extol the benefits of transatlantic
partnership both explicitly and implicitly. The small section  which
deals with European security makes it clear that NATO is the only
game in town. The European Union is listed as just one of many in the
paragraph which states: "A wide range of other institutions also have
major parts to play in the development and reinforcement of European
security".</P>

<P>The House of Commons Defence Committee noted that the SDR had done
little to clarify or advance the development of the European Security
and Defence Identity (8th Report para 140). In evidence to the
Committee, Tony Lloyd, the Minister of State at the FCO, had
explained the importance of the Treaty of Amsterdam as a defining
moment: "whilst it allows the European Union to engage in dialogue
with the WEU, it certainly does not see it within the European
Union's capacity to make political decisions which would command the
WEU and that is very important" (8th Report para 2881).</P>

<H4>Moving towards Europe</H4>

<P>Whitehall officials claim that the desire for better arrangements
for co-operation on defence matters within Europe is nothing new. The
failure to achieve a consensus European position on the use of force
in Iraq in the Spring showed how far Europe has to go. Kosovo
demonstrates that Europe continues to rely on the US to sort out
local problems.  Yet, the Prime Minister's initiative has signalled a
fundamental change from the traditional UK government line.  </P>

<P>His interview in The Times of 21 October 1998 contained little in
the way of concrete proposals, but was strongly supportive of the
European Union taking a more proactive role in defence matters. He
cited the Kosovo crisis as underlining the need for  Europe to be
able to speak and act more effectively. The article left the role of
the WEU in future European security arrangement under some question
</P>

<H4>Rationale for Change</H4>

<P>There are a number of possible reasons why Tony Blair may have
launched this new approach to European defence.  Given the high
international standing of the UK military capability, the government
might wish to play to its strength in Europe. Excluded from the inner
circle of EU economic debate, the UK might seek to take the lead in
security matters. There may also be concern that the Euroland
participants will move  quite quickly to shared foreign and security
arrangements. There is also the looming appointment of an EU head of
foreign and security policy. Perhaps, the UK wants to make sure that
it has a strong voice in the selection process, and in the definition
of the role for the post.  The pressures for rationalisation of
European defence industries may also be a factor. There is no doubt
that the UK government is keen on promoting the process, and it may
see that it will be helped by more structured European defence policy
co-operation.</P>

<P>While there are a number of policy advantages to this change of
approach by the UK, it is likely that Tony Blair is bruised by his
experiences over Iraq and Kosovo. Having the UK always cast in the
role of servant to the United States at the expense of Europe is not
a comfortable position for a pro-European Prime Minister. That said,
he can have few illusions about the difficulty of achieving a true
common foreign and security policy among the disparate members of the
EU.  The prize is great: currently the defence capability of Europe
is less than the sum of its parts.  A coherent defence effort could
make Europe a more equal partner in its relations with the United
States.</P>
