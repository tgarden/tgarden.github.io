			<h3>Kiss Goodbye to Kyoto </h3>
			<p>By Sir Timothy Garden</p>
		</div>
		<p>With one mighty bound Gerorge W.Bush was free. During the presidential election campaign he promised that he would work for reductions in US greenhouse gas emissions. Specifically he said that he would &#147;require all power plants to meet clean air standards in order to reduce emission of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury and carbon dioxide.&#148; On 13 March he announced that he would not be seeking major reductions in carbon dioxide emissions from electricity generating power stations. At a White House press conference on 28 March ahead of the visit by Chancellor Schroeder of Germany, his spokesman went further, saying: &#147;The President has been unequivocal. He does not support the Kyoto treaty. It exempts the developing nations around the world, and it is not in the United States' economic best interest. The President has directed his Cabinet Secretaries to begin a review so we can, as a nation, address a serious problem, which is global warming. That Cabinet-level review is underway, and the President looks forward to receiving the results.&#148; While this was a very sharp put down for the German leader, who holds together a coalition which includes the Green Party, it potentially has much greater implications for international relations.<br>
			<br>
			Few doubt that the $47,370,758 of campaign contributions which the Republican Party received from the energy industry towards election costs are a major factor in this policy change. As Governor of Texas, Bush had shown little interest in environmental issues if they interfered with profits. The State has an unenviable reputation for pollution. Yet the US is already suffering extremes of weather, and the resultant costs, which are just a foretaste of worse to come as global warming effects bite more deeply. It would therefore have been relatively easy to make a case for  the Kyoto protocol based on US national interests. The recent power cuts in California are prayed in aid of the need to reduce energy production costs. US citizens expect their energy to be cheap, as any European filling up a car in America knows. Yet the 4% of the world&#146;s population who live in the USA produce 25% of the total greenhouse gas emissions. It may be that this new form of extra-territorial action by America &#150; the pollution of the world&#146;s atmosphere &#150; will have a profound effect on international relationships.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			In the three months of the new Presidency, the US has gained a cavalier reputation in its approach to international agreements. The difficulties in gaining ratification in Congress for treaties which any president signs is nothing new. Clinton was unable to get the necessary vote to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. What is new now is an Administration that seems to prepared to discard hard negotiated agreements. The anti-ballistic missile treaty is seen as no bar to proposals for national missile defence. The Kyoto protocol is abandoned without any pretence of an alternative. The reversal of the support for the North/South dialogue in Korea, the assistance to Russia and the relationship with China add another level of concern for US allies.<br>
			<br>
			Those countries which believe they have a special relationship with the US, such as Britain, Germany, Japan and South Korea are now in a policy bind. The world knows that they were not consulted about US policy reversals which will affect them very significantly. The special relationship appears to be more and more of that between master and servant. In each case, the advantages of being on good terms with the economic and military giant seems to outweigh the disadvantages of taking a critical stand. Tony Blair was perhaps fortunate to get an early meeting with George Bush before they had too many difficult issues to negotiate. Some suggest that he may already have reassured Bush that the UK would accept the rebuilding of Fylingdales radar for US missile defences. If true, that would be a pity. Europe may need to bargain more roughly with the US in future, and perhaps take a greater interest in its own regional interests.<br>
			<br>
			Let us hope that Christine Whitman, the head of the US Environmental Protection Agency, finds time for an after hours drink with Colin Powell, the Secretary of State. They have both been put in the humiliating position of defending policies which were reversed by the President almost as they were speaking. Maybe a time will come when they decide resignation is the only course. Bush wants a second term in office, he would be careless to lose two of his most able and respected people.<br>
