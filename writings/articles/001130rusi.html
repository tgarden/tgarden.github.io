<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Graham has told us where we are now as a
result of all the detailed staff work that has been going on post
Helsinki. Many of you will know that I have been arguing for the past
3 years that our only hope for a useful defence capability in the
long term is by moving towards operating at the regional level rather
than at the national level. I am therefore delighted that we have the
military working so closely together throughout the EU on providing a
real capability. But as Graham has said, there is much still to do,
and this is not the first time that such efforts have been
made.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">At one level, this is a sensible attempt to
make some progress in harmonising defence effort across the EU so
that it can at least generate a useful force of 60,000 men out of its
2 million troops. It ought to give a much needed impetus for the
development of some key capabilities such as intelligence and
strategic airlift, altough it is not clear whether it will do so.
What it does not do is generate any new resources for defence. It
gives free-rider nations an opportunity to run their defence forces
down further by concentrating only on their contribution to this new
force. Years of experience at fudging goals in the NATO force
planning process make me sceptical of achieving the Corps capability
easily or in full. However, it does at least start putting in place
some structures to look at filling in the long list of missing
capabilities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">What I want to do in my remarks is to look
beyond the immediate plans to the longer term. It will be good if
Europe thinks a bit more deeply about its security needs, and it will
be helpful to have a more ready set of forces to deploy for minor
crises. This is however is not sufficient. What is needed urgently,
and in parallel with the Helsinki goal work, are some practical moves
to get better value from the 170 Bn Euros that EU nations waste on
defence every year. In a Europe where sovereignty wasn't such a
hang-up, I could imagine Javier Solana, with wise advice from George
Robertson, doing a full Strategic Defence Review which ensured that
European forces were structured sensibly to support European and NATO
needs. As one leading defence industry man said to me, if we ran our
operation the way Europe does defence, we would be bankrupt. It is
ripe for rationalisation and flattening of management layers. However
in the real world, this is some decades away. This is not a reason to
do nothing. In NATO AWACs we have a good example of how an expensive,
but important, capability can be afforded if it is operated at the
supranational level. Nobody gets excited about sovereignty, and all
NATO members both contribute to and benefit from this shared
capability. There are many possible areas where such an approach
could be used. Time will only let me give you a quick taste of some
examples.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Europe needs an air transport capability.
Some ten EU nations operate C130 Hercules military transport aircraft
. It would be possible to imagine a pooled fleet of 70 aircraft,
which would look after all the national C130 needs of Belgium,
Denmark, Italy, Netherlands, Spain , Sweden and Portugal, and to
which France, the UK and Greece might provide a partial contribution
from their larger fleets. For those nations that were prepared to put
all of their C130 fleets into a common pool, there would be
significant savings in operating costs. They would also have a much
better assurance of availability on a day to day basis, given the
ability to plan routine servicing across a larger fleet. For Europe
there would be a usable airlift capability for humanitarian
operations as well as for use within NATO. This is quite different
from multinational forces as it requires a single headquarters and a
single support and maintenance structure. Nations would be able to
close down their expensive national establishments and use the money
saved to buy new capabilities. I welcome the start that is being made
in this sort of pooled arrangement by Germany, working initially with
the Netherlands. The promises of joint procurement of A400M are
important in an industrial respect, but do not produce the efficiency
of operation unless they are operated as a single fleet.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Air to air refuelling capability is also
needed by all European air forces, and would be a natural candidate
for a European fleet operation. There is consideration being given to
procuring the UK air to air refuelling capability through a public
private partnership arrangement. This would be particularly easy to
enlarge to encompass those nations in Europe which sought such a
facility. The economics of the operation would improve for the larger
fleet and there would be no sovereignty issues to worry about given
the service is being provided by the private sector. The Defence
Select Committee in its Lessons of Kosovo has already reported that
it seems odd that the UK is to invest so much in tanking capability,
when it is already a disproportionate provider for the rest of
Europe. Would it not be more sensible for Tony Blair to offer half
the amount set aside in the Defence Programme as a catalyst to
contributions from every other EU member towards a common European
contracted capability. With the vast amount of money saved, there
would be seed corn for a European SEAD capability, and some spare
change for the MOD and even for the Treasury. Not only that but the
contractor would have the economies of scale which would allow lower
running costs to be passed on.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Five EU nations are ordering the Eurofighter
for delivery from 2002 onwards. Each nation will set up its
headquarters for planning and support, a training base, and a myriad
of support organisations. Over a period of years, each nation will
change its version of Eurofighter in different ways (just as we have
seen with the Tornado). Interoperability will get worse as time goes
on, unless there is common management and doctrine. This is a role
for a single EU military headquarters, which would operate an EU
mixed nationality Eurofighter force of perhaps 400 aircraft. If any
nation still felt the need to retain some independent national
capability, it could rotate crews and aircraft through the EU force
on a regular basis. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In the marine environment, one could
cumulate existing capacities and provide common supply services,
possibly leading to a rationalisation of the number of European naval
bases. Fleet auxiliaries can be envisaged as developing a common
European service. An early candidate as one of the European Force
Elements, would be a European mine counter measure service. The
principle could be applied to larger ships. France, Italy, Spain and
the United Kingdom all wish to have some aircraft carrier capability;
could it be provided by a common squadron thereby providing savings
in support and logistic chains, while also ensuring that a viable
force was available at all times? A European led Combined Joint Task
Force in the maritime environment at present lacks a satisfactory
headquarters ship; one, or more, of these could be acquired on a
common basis.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">It would make sense to begin the approach to
land forces by looking at engineers, communications, transport and
medical services, which could provide the first common programmes.
The wider field of logistic support could follow and an early
candidate would be the development of common IT systems for
logistics. The question of outsourcing logistic and support services
is now under active consideration in a number of European countries.
There would be economies through the working out of common
specifications and the use of a limited number of common
suppliers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">.Again let me make it clear that I am not
talking about multinational forces - but supranational pooled forces.
Whenever anyone tells you that they have a very good and productive
multinational arrangement, you must ask them how many people fewer
are needed as a result; how many bases were closed as a result; how
many headquarters were eliminated; what are the common logistics and
support arrangements. Why is this distinction important? Because the
only way to get more bang for your Euro is to be more efficient. We
know how to do that nationally, and for the UK have exhausted the
rationalisations that are possible through successive reviews. To
provide new capabilities ( the ones that were identified in that long
list of the DCI by NATO at the Washington summit), Europe needs
defence money. It will not get enough extra money. We seem to think
that managing to hold defence spending level in real terms is enough.
It isn't: manpower and equipment costs rise faster than inflation.
The number of operations increase costs again in all sorts of
different ways, both direct and in terms of lessons learned. We need
therefore to aim for two things - national defence budgets linked to
a fixed proportion of GDP, and start up money coming from EU defence
rationalisation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">As the EU moved along these paths, it would
be important to ensure that there was no free ride for less
enthusiastic members. The establishment of a European Defence Budget
would be an early priority and would force member nations to take a
serious interest in agreeing what capability Europe needs. Nations
could then either contribute capability or funds. This would
undoubtedly lead to a virtuous circle of each nation volunteering
force capability, and a realisation that they get more capability
when their defence budget supports European rather than national
forces. I shall leave John Roper to explore the mechanisms by which
this might be possible.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Finally, as forces were increasingly
operated at the European level, the common doctrine and operational
planning would lead to common equipment requirements. Industry would
welcome a larger common customer for its products. We would have the
operational requirement driving the industry, rather than the need to
find business for our local industry driving the programme. Role
specialisation might happen, but it would be in a planned manner
rather than the random system of today. The inefficiencies of
duplicated support that we see in today's multinational forces would
be eliminated. Europe would be a more equal partner with the United
States within NATO, and would be able to field its own diplomatic and
military capability if necessary. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In summary, I welcome greatly the vigour
with which my country is approaching the development of European
defence capabilities. However, we need to apply the logic of our own
SDR to Europe as a whole, and free up the vast wasted resources by
sensible rationalisation of duplicated defence overheads. We should
look for early opportunities to pool common capabilities, take the
savings in overheads and spend them on such much needed things as a
European intelligence element. What I am suggesting is unlikely to be
welcomed by those who stand to lose jobs, bases, headquarters and
stars. Defence Reviews are never popular while they are being done.
It is unlikely that Defence Ministries across the EU will be
enthusiastic (turkeys don't vote for Christmas) - but Finance
Ministries should be. </FONT></P>
