<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In 1914 and again in 1939, it was possible for the great military
powers to consider war in classic Clausewitzian terms as an
instrument of policy; one among other such instruments like diplomacy
or economic pressure for achieving national objectives in the
competitive arena of power relations. In 1914, all the major
belligerents imagined that the killing and destruction would take
place on enemy territory as their armies carried out war-winning
offensives, while in the meantime their own homelands, their seats of
political and industrial power, remained unscathed. Only in the
course of four years of slow-burning attrition was this confident
sense of immunity from the direct scourge of war gradually eroded.
Even in 1939, with the example of the cumulative destructiveness of
the Great War before them, it was possible for the Nazi leadership to
march against Poland in the belief that it had to face no more than a
local campaign against a feebler power, and that no inevitable or
devastating consequence could befall Germany itself. Again it took
long years of war before such retribution reached the point of
destroying Germany as a modern industrial society.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>But with the coming of the nuclear age, above all the
thermo-nuclear age, it is no longer possible for any great military
power to consider war against another as a rational, usable,
instrument of policy; no longer possible for general staffs and
cabinets in an international crisis to take decisions that risk, or
bring nearer, the outbreak of armed conflict in that spirit of
levity, certainly irresponsibility, in which Austria-Hungary in July
1914 issued its ultimatum to Serbia, or Nazi Germany fomented the
Polish crisis in August-September 1939. For there can be no illusion
now that the destruction will only occur far off in another country.
It is as if in 1914 the consequences of Austria's going to war with
Serbia were known in advance by the Austrians to be the immediate and
inevitable destruction of Vienna and much else besides; as if in 1939
the consequences of Germany invading Poland were known to be the
instant production of those scenes in Berlin, Hamburg, Dresden and
the Ruhr that in fact took six years to complete.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Thus there can be no successful 'Schlieffen Plan' or 'Blitzkrieg'
with nuclear weapons against another nuclear power. Nuclear weapons
cannot serve as Clausewitzian instruments of national policy in the
rivalry between nuclear great powers. They can only dissuade, by
their menacing presence in the cupboard, the use of nuclear weapons
by a hostile power, or prevent the employment of nuclear blackmail in
diplomacy. Their only rational utility is therefore as a stand-off,
as 'deterrence'.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>It is not only that nuclear war itself is unthinkable as a
profitable instrument of policy, it is also that it renders even
conventional conflict between nuclear powers so loaded with the risk
of ultimate nuclear devastation that such conventional conflict too
has been rendered obsolete as an instrument of policy in great power
rivalry.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Given that thermonuclear armories are unprofitable, indeed
suicidally unusable, as the means of settling quarrels between
nuclear states, there remains only the complex question of
'deterrence' itself. This, coupled with awareness of the appalling
potential destructive power of those armories, has kept academics,
military men, politicians and disarmers busy since the l950s debating
on paper and platforms and in committees. The topic of nuclear
deterrence has come to supply something of the intellectual role of
religion in the Middle Ages, in that it has inspired a new generation
of nuclear 'theologians' or schoolmen, mostly in American
think-tanks, to argue the subtleties of deterrent and conflict theory
with the ingenuity of a St Thomas Aquinas; and equally inspired a new
breed of itinerant preachers blazing with fervour, warning of the
wrath to come, and calling on men to nuclear repentance.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The problem for the non-specialist who would understand
'deterrence~ and inform himself of the differing views about the
nature of effective deterrence adopted by the various nuclear powers
(and hence their actual nuclear policies) has lain in trying to find
a short, lucid, dispassionate and yet authoritative reference book.
It is this hitherto empty slot that Group Captain Garden's Can
Deterrence Last? so excellently fills.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The book is the fruit of a year at Cambridge University working
for the degree of M Phil in International Relations, when Group
Captain Garden was able to sieve through the massive literature of
deterrent theory and at the same time study the evolution of
differing national policies towards nuclear weapons. He brings to his
analysis an extra dimen- sion of understanding, in that he is a
serving airman who has himself lived with the responsibility of
commanding a squadron of V-bombers with nuclear capability. He
therefore knows at first hand the realities of what he is here
writing about. His approach is practical and responsible as well as
doubly well-informed. Moreover, the objectiveness of his analysis is
enhanced by a studied coolness of language, and language mercifully
free from unnecessary jargon.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Can Deterrence Last? opens with a clear and skeptical summary of
the elements of deterrence theory as advanced by leading nuclear
thinkers, discussing the role of such factors as a credible
operational capability on the one hand and on the other a credible
political will to respond with nuclear weapons if any enemy resorts
to them. There follow succinct dossiers on the raisons d'etre for,
and historical development of, the nuclear deterrent systems of the
US, Soviet Russia, Britain, France and China, with glances at
potential if not actual nuclear powers like Israel and India. Group
Captain Garden's book concludes with an examination of the political
and technological factors that make for nuclear stability between the
powers, hence reducing to the minimum the risk of a catastrophic
nuclear exchange, or that make for a perilous instability. He
perceives little hope for successful arms agreement~ but believes
that the best chance of continued stability lies in nuclear weapons
systems that are invulnerable to a pre-emptive strike, so that an
aggressor could never be sure of escaping retribution. He regards
better 'hot-line' communi- cation links, coupled with the mutual
sparing of national leadership centres in order to ensure command and
control in the event of an 'accidental' nuclear discharge, as further
means of enhancing stability. Group Captain Garden cannot offer some
magical escape route from the fact of the existence of nuclear
weapons, but he does leave us with the hopeful prognosis that it is
this very existence which alone can best guard against their use.

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Can Deterrence Last? ought to be in the library of every
educational institution and on the bookshelf of every concerned
person, for it constitutes an essential text for anyone wishing to
form, or express, an opinion about nuclear weapons and their role in
international relationships.</P>
