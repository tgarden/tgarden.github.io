<P><CENTER><I>A presentation at Madingley Hall, Cambridge on 6
November 1996</I></CENTER></P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><CENTER><B>Introduction</B></CENTER></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>When I joined the RAF in 1963, Britain was coming to the end of
its East of Suez period. Yet there were still exotic postings to the
Far East available, people talked almost longingly of their year's
unaccompanied service in Salalah, we could fly down for the weekend
to Sharjah or Bahrein, or closer at hand to Malta and to Libya.
Today, the UK has only Hong Kong in the Far East and that for less
than a year more. Although the 1996 White Paper as always shows the
world map with activities flagged across it, the permanent bases are
now down to Germany, Cyprus, the Falklands, Gibraltar, Ascension
Island, Diego Garcia, Brunei, and Canada. There are of course other
overseas deployments, and I shall talk about their role in a moment.
</P>

<P>This trend is not confined to the UK. Most obviously the European
bases outside Russia which served the Soviet Union have virtually all
gone in the last 5 years. There are still Russian and some FSU troops
in some of the former Soviet republics, and less than a thousand each
in Vietnam, Cuba and Mongolia. The United States has been reducing
its overseas presence, particularly in Europe, but still has
significant forces in some 26 overseas countries. France has reduced
its presence in Germany since the end of the Cold War, but still has
a remarkable number of overseas bases with around 28,000 troops
deployed. I note you have not explicitly looked at France during this
seminar, but we might come back to it in discussion.</P>

<P>Once you have looked at the big four - USA, Russia, UK and France
- I can only find four other players outside UN operations, NATO
contributions and small scale advisers. Syria has corps strength
forces based in Lebanon. Singapore has training facilities in Brunei,
Taiwan, Thailand and Australia. To which we should add Greece and
Turkey in Cyprus.</P>

<P>In this presentation, I shall first look at the roles which
overseas bases might be expected to fulfil in the future - as there
are a number of different possibilities. Having done that, I shall
give you my view of the general security context over the next 10 to
15 years. How alliances may develop, what kinds of operations we are
going to see, how we will train for these tasks, and what resources
will be available. From this, I shall try to deduce the most likely
trends in overseas bases globally, and then narrow down to consider
the particular implications for the UK. My approach is the sort of
thinking that I might have done in the central programmes staff when
deciding what policy advice I should give on the allocation of funds
to future basing requirements, and their implications for the rest of
the defence programme. I hope that will be a good stimulus for a
debate at the end.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><CENTER><B>Types of Overseas Basing</B></CENTER></P>

<P>For my purposes I have divided the justification for an overseas
base for any nation into five different categories: Occupation of
territory, operational need, collective security, a business
arrangement, and a multinational organisation. As the rationale for
each of these is different, we need to consider the factors that
affect each in order to come up with any thoughts on what the future
might hold.</P>

<P><B>Occupation</B></P>

<P>My first category is a bit brutal. That of occupation. Nations
establish bases in other countries in order to keep them subjugated,
to show that they are the masters and to have force readily available
to keep their conquests. The Romans did it in Britain, the Crusaders
did it in the Middle East, the British did it throughout the British
Empire, the Germans did it in occupied Europe, the Japanese did it in
the territories they took in the second world war and the Soviets did
it throughout the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Most recently Iraq
did it in Kuwait.</P>

<P>We are probably living in a time when this particular reason for
overseas bases is at its lowest ebb in recorded history. The
international community looks rather dimly on the forceful placing of
troops in another country. That does not mean that it cannot happen,
but it does mean that there is a greater opportunity to take
countermeasures through the UN than in previous times. We shall have
to look at where there are possible territorial wars in the future to
decide how relevant this category is in the future.</P>

<P><B>Operational need</B></P>

<P>My second category is that of operational need. Arrangements are
made with the host nation to allow basing to meet a particular
operational need which both countries have a common view on. The
basing for US &amp; UK aircraft in Turkey and in Saudi to provide
cover over Iraq is an example. Bases in Italy and the former republic
of Yugoslavia for the various UN authorised operations is another
illustration of how overseas basing can result from an operational
need. In many cases such a need will be time limited, and will
involve more than one nation. The base may therefore be shared, or
administered by the host nation. There may be significant constraints
on operational flexibility, because of restrictions imposed by the
host nation. However for some of the long term peacekeeping
operations, like the UN in Cyprus or in the Golan, the bases become
pretty permanent arrangements, and even start taking on the character
of the visiting nation. I was surprised to find one Polish UN base in
the Golan which was equipped with 4 saunas - The Finns had been there
for some time in the past. For the future of such bases, we shall
need to consider whether these sorts of operations are on the
increase, decline or will remain about the same.</P>

<P><B>Collective Security</B></P>

<P>The overseas basing that most of us are familiar with today is
that which stems from collective security, and in particular through
the NATO alliance. Alliances in the past have generated overseas
bases, but they have disappeared with the demise of the various
treaty organisations. In any discussion of future basing, we shall
need to take a very close look at the future trends for NATO, and the
US would need to look closely at the future of their security
relationship with Japan, and in Korea. The US presence in the UK, and
the US, UK, and French presence in Germany has declined significantly
in recent times. What does this portend for various future NATO
options?</P>

<P>There is one particular aspect of the Collective Security
requirement for overseas basing, and that is the storage of nuclear
weapons overseas. In the Cold War this was a vital part of
deterrence, and showed a commitment both by the nuclear power and by
the host country. We are now seeing the removal of these sites and
also questions over nuclear storage in enlargement states.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>Multinational (HQ/TTTE)</B></P>

<P>Perhaps my fourth category is not really distinct from the second
and third. Certainly multinational overseas bases arise out of both
operational need and out of collective security requirements. The
reason that I wanted to break it out as a distinct category of
overseas base was that there are some different and interesting
considerations when looking at requirements for multinational bases.
They may be justified on the basis of more economical operation.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The Tri-national Training Unit at RAF Cottesmore was a way of
providing a single facility for Tornado training for UK, German and
Italian aircrew. It is a form of overseas base for two of the
nations. However, if its rationale is one of cost saving, it becomes
vulnerable if the balance of costs change. When we look to the future
possibilities, we need to consider whether particular collaborative
weapons projects will provide similar opportunities in future for one
nation to host training or engineering facilities.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Also within this category is the multinational headquarters and
the multinational force. The ARRC, with its permanent single nation
lead generates a requirement for a UK lead cell to be present where
the headquarters is located. Thus a presence in Germany continues
under a multinational banner. In the same way rationalisation of NATO
HQ can change the balance of overseas basing. The establishment of
AFNORWEST at High Wycombe brought a new multinational HQ into being
in the UK. Again we shall need to consider where we think NATO is
going.Europe is discussing a common foreign and security policy, and
we also need to consider whether this has implications for overseas
basing.</P>

<P><B>A business arrangement (training)</B></P>

<P>The final category that I am considering for overseas bases is
that of a straight business arrangement, which may of course be done
within an alliance framework, but not necessarily. Training
facilities for the military become more and more difficult to keep in
the densely populated western European mainland. Canada has provided
training facilities for both the Army and the air forces of NATO at a
price using its vast tracts of unpopulated land. Here the trade off
between cost of training at that distance has to be weighed against
the value of the freedom to train and the savings in facilities
closer to home. We shall need to consider whether such business
arrangements may appeal to central european countries as they look
for ways to both gain hard currency and to contribute to NATO as part
of their bid for membership.</P>

<P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="+1">The Future Defence
Environment</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In thinking about the future of overseas bases, we must make some
assumptions about the future defence environment. Time will not allow
me to spend too long on this, but it is the key to the question of
whether they are worth the cost.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>Alliances</B></P>

<P>In the short time since the end of the Cold War, we have seen some
rapid changes in Alliance structure. The Warsaw Pact has disappeared
and NATO has been seeking a way to adjust to the new realities. I
believe it has done rather well in walking a tightrope between being
stuck in an irrelevant past, and moving so quickly to an enlarged
Alliance that it loses its military capability. The WEU has flared
and dimmed in the meanwhile, and has probably found its right level
now. The search for a common European Defence Identity has not
disturbed the integrity of NATO, which remains the world's only
viable military alliance. So a reasonable planning assumption is that
NATO will manage the transition to a somewhat larger organisation
with close links with son of PfP partners. The US will stay involved,
but perhaps to a declining extent in terms of troops in Europe, and
all nations will be expected to make some contributions. For the some
nations this might be in the form of training opportunities on their
territory.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>Operations</B></P>

<P>In looking at the kinds of operations that nations will find
themselves involved in, we are bound to be more speculative. Today,
most armed forces serving overseas, do so as part of a UN force.
There was a time recently when it looked as though these operations
were set to increase both in number and in scale. I think the signals
are now more mixed. The lessons of Somalia and Bosnia, the reluctance
of US support for the UN, and a weariness with international anarchy
suggest that we may have peaked. Nevertheless, there are plenty of
peacekeeping operations in being, and many will continue for years.
Such operations are also theoretically possible under a European
rather than UN flag. Perhaps sponsored by OSCE or EU. The problems
would be similar to UN sponsored operations, and are in any event
fairly unlikely as things are currently.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>At the higher intensity end of the spectrum, where will the next
wars be? Perhaps an Arab/Israeli war. This would be difficult for the
international community. Europe might side with the Arabs, and
America with the Israelis. Perhaps an India/Pakistan war; North/South
Korea; China/Taiwan; almost any Central African mix of countries. In
all these more obvious cases, the preparation that the international
community can make is limited. Only for the Korea case is overseas
basing an issue, and the Americans are there for now.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>Training Requirements</B></P>

<P>One factor of great significance is the military training
requirement for the future. Military training is always an irritation
to civilian neighbours. While they may reluctantly accept low flying
as "the sound of freedom" when there was an obvious and immediate
threat from the Red Army, they are less happy now there is no
rationale to which they can relate. We sometimes forget that West
Germany was removing low flying from its territory even before the
wall came down. The argument for bases in Germany to provide
realistic training has reversed in the last 10 years. Now RAF
aircraft must fly from Germany to the UK to train, and British Army
tanks based in Germany must train in Canada.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Some of the prospective new NATO members may be able to offer
training space as a contribution to NATO. I think you discussed this
in an earlier session, and I shall be interested to here the outcome
of your discussion. However this is likely only to be an option for a
limited time. As their economies improve, and the people become more
comfortable, they will also rebel at having to suffer the
environmental nuisance of military training. Nevertheless it may be a
short term consideration in the question of overseas basing.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Certainly there will be increasing pressure to find places to
train as European populations become less and less willing to put up
with the noise and other pollution of training. This is showing new
signs of importance in the UK, with the difficulty the army is having
in upgrading its training areas. The answer may well be a move
towards more simulation, rather than more overseas training. Costs
will be a major factor.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>Resources Available</B></P>

<P>The fourth area to consider is the question of how much money is
going to be available, and what are the costs of overseas
bases.Global defence spending has decreased by around 30% since the
end of the Cold War, and this decline looks set to continue. In
looking at how to obtain cost efficient forces, nations are bound to
examine overseas bases critically. Decisions are difficult. The bases
can give great advantage in terms of operational efficiency, training
opportunities, reaction time, and, not to be forgotten, interesting
postings for the servicemen and women. The running costs however are
high when they require facilities for families in a foreign land. We
all know the US bases which recreated a small US mid-Western town
down to the last detail wherever they are. Add on the costs that the
host nation may charge, the distance of the logistic lines of
communications, and these overseas bases become significantly more
expensive to run than home bases which can plug in to their national
infrastructure.</P>

<P>However, the usual planning problem is that you don't start with a
clean sheet of paper. This translates into what do you do to
reprovide the basing if you bring the boys back home. If it is done
at a time of downsizing, there may be some spare capacity, but it
will still cost to modify. If it is done when downsizing is complete,
either current accommodation must be more densely populated or new
facilities must be set up. Either route is expensive. So quite often
the decision will be a spend to save one, trading early costs for
long term savings. This inevitably slows the process down.</P>

<P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Trends in Overseas Bases and
Alternatives</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>If I put all these thoughts together what do I deduce as the
trends for overseas bases? The international community can be roused
to action, if a nation tries to use force to establish an overseas
base, and those that were legacy of empire are fast disappearing (
although France is a bit slow at this). Bases for training in
unpopulated areas will continue to have attraction, but have many
costs associated. We are left then with multinational organisations:
and for those the UN and NATO. There are plenty of examples of UN
bases, some of long standing, and others established for an operation
of limited timescale. They may gain some national characteristics,
but they are essentially international and for most the ownership
rotates.</P>

<P>NATO is at a somewhat uncertain time in its history (you may ask
when was it not?). The trend must however be away from the
positioning of external forces in Central Europe. Exchanges will
continue, host nation support will continue, but the little England
in North Rhine Westphalia, or the American way of life in Huntingdon
is set to disappear. For the US, this means that they are looking for
new ways to project power which do not rely on permanent far distant
bases. They have shown that their air power can operate on an
intercontinental basis, their reconnaissance is from space, their
naval power can use nuclear powered carriers, but they still have a
problem with land power.</P>

<P>I am a great supporter of the advantages of sea power being able
to loiter without requiring overseas bases. However, it is also
limited in what it can do. The recent decision to acquire submarine
launched cruise missiles for the Royal Navy shows that HMG believes
that this is a useful option, but in the numbers the UK will have it
cannot be of any use without significant other forces available. In
the same way Marines, and airborne forces, seem to give an ability to
project power on the ground from a distance, but the costs of that
projection for any given power capability are unsustainable for any
nation apart from the US. The US Marine Corps has as many troops as
the British Army and the Royal Navy put together, about the same
combat fixed wing aircraft as the RAF, and more armed helicopters
than the British Army.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></B></P>

<P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Decisions for the UK</FONT></B>
</CENTER></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>So what does all this mean for the UK? In the absence of a new
major threat, it is likely that the resources allocated to defence
will continue to decline. There is no great sympathy within the
electorate for defence expenditure. Defence expenditure might
eventually settle at around the 2% of GDP, which has been the norm
for industrialised nations at peace in the past. This would
represent, at constant GDP, a reduction in expenditure by another
third. Commitments can barely be covered at present. Therefore some
form of Defence Review will become necessary, and the Labour Party,
if elected, has undertaken to carry one through in its first 6 months
in government.</P>

<P><B>Foreign Policy Options</B></P>

<P>Looking to the variables in such a review, assuming that resources
will continue to decline, commitments and capability will need to be
closely studied. In broad terms, many of the commitments now
undertaken are of an optional nature. The scale of UK commitments
stems from the foreign policy requirement to "punch above our
weight". The nuclear deterrent force is one such example. The scale
of forces for UN operations is another. A government review would
need to consider whether such an approach to foreign policy was
sustainable.</P>

<P>It could, but I think it unlikely, take the view that the UK
should operate, with the rest of Europe, at a level which reflected
its economic position. The population and GDP of Britain is virtually
the same as that of Italy; and the adoption of an Italian approach to
defence would have significant implications. Italy spends $20bn
against the UK's $34bn on defence annually. There is an even more
austere option, where the UK could depend on the rest of Europe as a
buffer to any potential threats from the East, and decide to provide
only for its territorial integrity. In practice, there would be a
range of possible positions that could be adopted between being a
major player on the international scene and being an isolated
European off-shore island. The UK approach to Europe has significance
here.</P>

<P><B>Three Futures</B></P>

<P>Analysis of the type of forces needed for the three foreign policy
approaches is complex. In broad terms, the minimalist option would
sustain an army which was mainly infantry, and was trained for
internal security operations as a first priority, with territorial
defence provided through reserves at low states of readiness. The
Army might be about 75,000 strong. The RAF would provide a small
fighter force for airspace policing, and transport and reconnaissance
support for the army and navy. It might be about 20,000 strong. The
RN would provide coastal and economic zone protection and would be
perhaps 15,000 strong. There would be almost no need for any new
equipment for the foreseeable future. Overseas bases would disappear,
and there would be sufficient space back home for the forces
required.</P>

<P>Readjusting, foreign and security policy to the Italian option
would probably see the land forces retained at around the current
level with reductions in the RAF and RN. New equipment would continue
to be needed, but with rather less urgency. Off the shelf purchases
on a trickle basis might provide an attractive option. Eurofighter
2000 might just survive, but there would be no Tornado GR4
replacement, no aircraft carrier replacement, no new frigate, and no
theatre missile defence systems. The Trident force might be retained
if a more positive move towards a European Defence Identity emerged.
Again economies would be sought from reduced overseas presence, but
there would be some costs in reproviding for the returning army
personnel.</P>

<P>If, as is perhaps most likely, the next Government decides to
continue to be a world player, it will not be able to reduce defence
expenditure much. It may decide that it is prepared to continue to
pay the price. However, even retaining current levels, some
adjustments will be necessary. The size of the army is probably
already too small for the commitments. The industrial and political
consequences reinforce the military case for proceeding with
Eurofighter 2000. The rationalisation options have by and large been
taken, and there will be a large capital expenditure if the army
returns from Germany. The cost of the next generation of aircraft
carrier, and its aircraft, coupled with the next generation of
Tornado, will hang over the programme. Some capabilities will
disappear even under this most optimistic scenario, and spreading of
procurement programmes will be worse than before. This is a recipe
for more of what we are already familiar with.</P>

<P>Your seminar is entitled "Strategic Necessity or Economic Burden.
For the UK the strategic necessity has virtually gone, and the
economic burden must be relieved. Thus the withdrawal from expensive
overseas bases will continue. The army might be forced to look at its
structure from the direction of increasing basing density. Greater
investment in simulation will be needed to reduce the overseas
training requirement. The overseas postings that remained would be
unaccompanied UN operations. A return to the old days that I started
with.</P>
