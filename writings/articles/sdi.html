<P>From the time that the United States first became vulnerable to
possible nuclear attack from Soviet missiles, strategists have
agonised over the paradoxes of mutual assured destruction (MAD).
During the Sixties, Robert McNamara, the US Secretary for Defense,
looked for ways to limit the damage to the American homeland in any
future superpower conflict, so as to enhance deterrence. Such
measures included counter- force targeting, civil defence and ABM
systems. After significant expenditure in all these areas he
concluded in 1965, in a statement to the Committee on Armed Services
that:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>If we were to try to secure survival of
a very high percentage of our population and if the Soviets were to
decide to frustrate this attempt because they viewed it as a threat
to their assured destruction capability, the extra cost to them would
be substantially less than the extra cost to us.l</I></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This view was not universally accepted, and work on the ABM
systems continued on both sides. While McNamara did not believe it
could offer any significant benefit against a massive Soviet attack,
he thought protection against the potential Chinese nuclear threat to
the US might be feasible. However, in 1966, the Joint Chiefs, backed
by a strong Congressional lobby, sought at heavy Soviet-orientated
ABM system, which was to be deployed as quickly as possible. The
announcement, late that year, of evidence of a Soviet ABM system
being developed, added weight to the pro-ABM lobby. The technical
difficulties, and the very high cost, led to a decision to deploy
only a light system in the US. This was described as having a
defensive role against the possible Chinese threat to cities, a
capability to make the Minuteman sites less vulnerable to Soviet
attacks, and as a safety measure against accidental firing of ICBMs
against the US. The Sentinel programme, as it was known, soon ran
into difficulties. In March 1969, President Nixon announced that a
defence against heavy Soviet attack was not feasible, and that the
programme needed to be modified. The new Safeguard ABM system was to
be designed purely to protect ICBM sites&emdash;a much more limited
aim. This did not stem the debate, both inside and outside of
government. There was concern about the cost of deploying such a
limited system, and its rationale finally became that of a bargaining
chip for arms limitation. Although we are not privy to the debates,
which undoubtedly took place, in the Soviet Union, it is likely that
they also concluded that effective BMD was likely to founder on
financial and technical grounds. Deployment of systems on both sides
was likely only to lead to increased deployment of ICBMs.</P>

<P>It was therefore in the interests of both the superpowers to
prevent widescale deployment of ABM systems, and as a result the ABM
treaty was negotiated as part of the strategic arms limitation talks
(SALT) in 1972. The SALT I ABM treaty prohibited each country from
deploying ABM defence systems at more than two sites. The 1974
protocol reduced this limit to one site on each side. In the event,
the United States has no system deployed, and the Soviet Union has a
light ABM ring around Moscow, which consists of thirty-two Galosh and
sixty-eight SH-04 missiles.</P>

<P>Ballistic missile defence foundered in the Sixties because the
capability which the technology could provide was of dubious
effectiveness, either in protecting cities or even in a limited aim
of protecting missile sites. The cost of deployment would have been
very high, and, given its limited effectiveness, the enemy could
counter at much less cost by deploying more ICBMs or more warheads.
The effect on the strategic balance, and on stability, was uncertain.
In the Eighties, the debate was opened again, with both superpowers
investing considerable effort in investigating possible BMD
technologies. Can the new technology promise a strategy which
enhances stability and can be afforded, or are we seeing history
repeating itself? To seek the answer to this question, we can examine
the well- documented US proposals for a ballistic missile defensive
system.</P>

<H3>THE HIGH FRONTIER</H3>

<P>The main elements of a next generation BMD system are summarised
in the High Frontier study.2 A layered defensive system which seeks
to destroy most hostile ICBMs in their early boost phase is proposed.
Those remaining would be re- attacked during their mid trajectory
phase. Those warheads penetrating the first two layers would be
attacked during the terminal phase by ground-based ABM systems. Civil
defence measures complement this defensive programme. The study
claims that:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>We can deploy in space a purely
defensive system of satellites using non- nuclear weapons which will
deny any hostile power a rational option for attacking our current
and future space vehicles or for delivering a militarily effective
first strike, with its strategic ballistic missiles on our country or
on the territory of our allies. Such a global ballistic missile
defence system is well within our present technological capabilities
and can be deployed in space in this decade at less cost than other
options that might be available to us to redress the strategic
balance.3</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Not everyone shares this degree of confidence in such a global BMD
deployment. In early 1983, President Reagan set up a commission to
review the strategic modernisation programme of the United States.
Among other topics, the Scowcroft Commission looked at the question
of BMD. They found that:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>Applications of current technology
offer no real promise of being able to defend the United States
against massive nuclear attack in this century. An easier task is to
provide ABM defence for fixed hardened targets, such as ICBM silos.
However, even this will be a difficult feat if an attacker can use a
large number of warheads against each defended target.4 </I></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>To look at these contradictory assessments in more detail, the
technological, economic, strategic and arms control implications must
all be considered.</P>

<H3>ABM TECHNOLOGIES</H3>

<P>Since the development of MIRV for strategic missile systems, the
problem with countering any ICBM attack has been significantly
complicated. Considerable benefit would therefore be gained by an ABM
system which destroyed the missile in its early boost phase, before
the independent re-entry vehicles had separated. Attack during this
phase brings two other advantages: boosters are far more visible than
RVs for detection, and it is more difficult to provide decoys which
look like boosters than it is to simulate RVs. The major disadvantage
is that boost-phase intercept of the ICBMs must take place over enemy
territory. This leads to the requirement for a space-based target
acquisition and interception system. If the critical boost-phase
interception can be achieved from space, then the mid trajectory
interception can also be space based. The terminal phase of the
layered defensive system would be met by ground-based systems
defending the expected target area.</P>

<P>A number of proposals have been made for possibly useful lines of
research for the space-based systems. These can be divided into
approaches based on directed-energy techniques and those dependent on
kinetic energy kill mechanisms. The interception problem is
formidable, with perhaps 2,000 boosters to be engaged within the
first three minutes of their flight. The near-instantaneous response
of directed-energy weapons, either lasers or particle beams, makes
them an attractive option for this time-urgent task. Laser weapons
would kill missiles either by burning through the booster skin, or
producing a shock wave which caused mechanical damage. One
calculation of the energy requirement has suggested that a 100
megawatt laser, using a mirror some four metres in diameter, could
cause sufficient damage to a target in approximately one second.S If
such a hydrogen chloride laser could be deployed in sufficient
numbers it would require 1,000 shuttle flights for energy stores
alone. This suggests that, for laser-based systems, a nuclear-pumped
X-ray laser would need to be developed.</P>

<P>Particle-beam weapons seek to kill missiles through damage to
their electronics. A charged-particle beam would suffer from
dispersion from unpredictable fluctuations in the earth's magnetic
field, and also from ionisation in the earth's atmosphere. A
neutral-particle beam cannot be accelerated or focused. Any
space-based particle-beam system would therefore need to accelerate a
charged-particle beam, focus it and then neutralise it by stripping
extra electrons from the atoms. This is a complex process, requiring
technology which is currently beyond the state of the art.
Consideration of the fuel requirements leads to similar conclusions
to the laser, and the likely necessity of a nuclear explosive system
for any workable particle-beam weapon. One analysis concludes 'all
these difficulties point to the conclusion that even though it might
be possible to construct an accelerator that would produce a beam of
hydrogen atoms intense and energetic enough to cause some damage to
the ICBM in its boost phase, a satellite-based neutral-particle-beam
ABM system would not be practical.'6</P>

<P>Kinetic energy kill systems can either be of the rocket- propelled
missile type, or of the hypervelocity gun system. The High Frontier
study sees the deployment of carrier satellites with conventional
missiles as a practical proposition. The total mass of such a system
precludes comprehensive deployment. A more promising area for
research into kinetic energy kill systems is to be the hypervelocity
electromagnetic railgun. This system uses a high energy
electromagnetic field to accelerate a hit-to-kill projectile to
speeds of the order of 5-25 km per second. Again, the power
requirements for such a system are prodigious, and are likely to need
nuclear generators.</P>

<P>Whatever system is used to kill the ICBMs, it must be able to cope
with a massive simultaneous attack. Target acquisition, tracking and
pointing all give significant technological problems. Numerous
counters to each weapon system are already in prospect. The
vulnerability of the weapon system itself is a major cause for
concern. Already antisatellite weapon systems are well advanced, and
one analyst has suggested that space-based ABM systems would be
particularly vulnerable to space mines. 7 In summary, the outstanding
technical problems are the provision of adequate target acquisition,
tracking and pointing systems, effective kill mechanisms at
attainable energy costs, and protection of the weapon system itself.
The Scowcroft Commission concluded that: 'At this time, however, the
Commission believes that no ABM technologies appear to combine
practicality, survivability, low cost and technical effectiveness
sufficiently to justify proceeding beyond the stage of technology
development.'s</P>

<P>Certainly the technology for terminal interception of ballistic
missiles has improved since the sixties. A favoured option for this
point defence of US ICBM sites is the Swarmjet. The system uses a
launcher with 500 to 1,000 unguided rockets fired simultaneously.
Between 5,000 and 10,000 rockets are assessed as giving an 85 per
cent probability of intercepting a single re-entry vehicle within the
lethal area of the Swarmjet system. Multiplying this requirement
across all the possible targets with the more than 7,000 Soviet RVs
currently deployed emphasises the importance of the boost-phase
interception.</P>

<P>Technology points to the possibility of such a comprehensive
layered defensive system, given infinite resources. The question is
what can be achieved with finite resources, and whether it is worth
doing.</P>

<H3>THE ECONOMICS OF BMD</H3>

<P>Given the uncertainties of the technologies discussed above, any
assessment of the cost of deploying a full-layered BMD system must be
speculative. The High Frontier study makes a detailed assessment of
the costs of deployment. It states that the whole system could be
deployed by 1990 for a total cost of $35 billion. However, 'cost data
validity for the illustrative High Frontier programs range from hard
to very soft.'9 A comparison with the cost of the UK Trident
programme, a much more modest affair, suggests that this may be an
order of magnitude underassessed. The Defensive Technologies Study
Team in the United States has already earmarked $11.4 billion merely
for research to select appropriate technology paths for ballistic
defence through either directed energy weapons or conventional
interceptors.l&#176; The North Atlantic Assembly scientific and
technical committee has assessed the cost for a total system in the
range of $100-500 billion.  For a comparison the 1983 defence budget
for the United States was a total of $240 billion.</P>

<P>Economic considerations are therefore going to play a major part
in any decisions on the deployment of a BMD system. Given the
economic difficulties that all nations are having in maintaining
their force levels, it may be the overriding factor.</P>

<H3>STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS</H3>

<P>Even if it is assumed that all the technological problems can be
overcome, at a price which is affordable, what are the implications
for the security of the West? None of the proponents of BMD make the
claim that it can ever produce a 100 per cent effective defence. The
exact percentage of 'leakage' is a matter of some debate. At the
upper end of effectiveness, a full deployment would protect
adequately against all contingencies except a massive retaliatory
counter-city attack. At the lower end of the assessment, the system
would merely reduce the vulnerability of the fixed land-based ICBMs
from a pre-emptive first strike. Any assessment of the effect of BMD
deployment on stability must depend on the prior assessment of
effectiveness.</P>

<P>If a high 'leakage' rate, say greater than 10 per cent of incoming
missiles, were found to be the likely value, then deployment could
not be cost effective. The enemy could always counter more cheaply by
increasing his missile numbers. The vulnerability would only be that
of land-based systems, and the continuing invulnerability of
submarine- launched ballistic missiles would ensure that deterrence
continued on the same basis as before.</P>

<P>If the BMD deployment appeared to hold in prospect a real change
in the strategic balance, what would the effect be then? A
simultaneous deployment by both sides of an effective BMD system
might make the possibility of fighting a conventional war both more
likely and more acceptable, in that the risks of unacceptable nuclear
destruction of the homeland had been reduced. Should one superpower
consider that the other might achieve deployment first, then the
prospects for stability could be of concern. The nation losing the
race for deployment might feel so threatened that it needed to take
pre-emptive action against the BMD system. Certainly, both sides will
feel the need to investigate the technologies, to have the capability
to deploy counter-measures, should the other side produce an
operational BMD system.</P>

<P>In summary, because perfect defence is unattainable, nuclear
deterrence, through the threat of massive retaliation, should remain
effective. Depending on the level of BMD effectiveness, it might be
that the prospect of limited war between the superpowers became
possible again. In any event both would need to deploy appropriate
counter-measures, which could include significant increases in their
nuclear systems.</P>

<H3>ARMS CONTROL IMPLICATIONS</H3>

<P>Research and development on ABM systems is permitted by the ABM
Treaty. The deployment of anything beyond a single- point defence
ground-based system would certainly require a renegotiation of the
Treaty, and in all probability termination of it. In the near term,
research can continue, but at the stage where field testing of new
systems was necessary, the provisions of Article V and the Treaty
would have to be broken. At this stage it would seem unlikely that
either side would feel it had much to gain from a new, and less
restrictive, treaty. It is, of course, possible that the demise of
the ABM Treaty would signal the end of the other arms limitation
protocols with a view to expanding the offensive capability on both
sides.</P>

<H3>THE CASE FOR BMD</H3>

<P>For the critics who express concern about technical difficulties,
shortsightedness of eminent scientists in the past is cited. Caspar
Weinberger, addressing the National Press Club in May 1984 reminded
his audience of the Chief of Staff during President Truman's
incumbency in 1945, who stated in regard to the atom bomb that: ' The
bomb will never go off and I speak as an expert in explosives.' He
went on to cite the statement of Dr Vannevar Bush, the President of
MIT in 1945, that: 'The whole idea that you could launch a missile
from one continent and hit a target 4,500 miles away is too
preposterous and absurd even to contemplate.'12 The strategists who
worry about the effects of the deployment of strategic defence
systems on stability and on the prospects for arms control are
reminded that the Soviets have an advanced research programme in this
field. Nor are the strategic arguments accepted by the proponents of
SDI:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>Not only can the Strategic Defense
Initiative strengthen deterrence it can also enhance the opportunity
for arms reductions. Strategic Defense can strengthen deterrence by
making it highly uncertain or impossible, for a missile attack to
achieve any rational military objective. And it can enhance arms
control by devaluing nuclear ballistic missiles, which will create
powerful incentives for sharp reductions in their
numbers&emdash;reductions that would enhance the security of the
United States, its allies, and the Soviet Union. 1 3</I></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>For those who worry about the costs of such a deployment,
regardless of the strategic or technical problems, it is argued that
the costs for such a system will be affordable, and indeed the
strategic defence will be a cost-effective way of pursuing
deterrence.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>I think we must approach the problem
that the President posed with the objective of making it affordable.
I think we can. You also have to remember that we spend approximately
15% of our annual defense budget on strategic forces, and strategic
force modernisation. And that is a whopping sum of money 14</I></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The debate then is becoming more heated, and more facts are
emerging into the public domain. Has greater public awareness shed
any more light on what is either possible or desirable?</P>

<H3>THE STRATEGIC DEFENSE INITIATIVE</H3>

<P>The first question to be answered is the nature of the Strategic
Defense Initiative. President Reagan appeared to be offering the
prospect of a magic bubble of invulnerability which could cover
America and Europe when he said: <I>' What if . . . we could
intercept and destroy ballistic missiles before they reached our own
soil or that of our allies?'15</I></P>

<P>This reflected the earlier strong assertions of the High Frontier
study group, who believed that a non-nuclear defence of cities was an
early possibility. Following the Presidential directive, the SDI has
been formalised and, in a statement to the Senate Committee on Armed
Services at the end of 1983, the Department of Defense explained the
proposals.16</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>It must be understood that our programme is not a
system development program. No decision has been made to develop and
deploy any weapons or other elements of the potential system. Our
state of knowledge of the relevant technologies is inadequate.
Consequently, the aim of this program is to improve our knowledge of
the relevant technologies by providing firm calculations and
experimental evidence on what such technologies could do and at what
cost. But in other words, our program is a research effort to provide
the evidentiary basis for an informed decision on whether and how to
proceed into system development. For a full, multi-tiered system, we
expect to complete the provision of this evidentiary basis by the
early 1990s. A careful analysis of defensive strategy and concepts of
operation is an essential element of this basis for an informed
decision. Our program also includes such an analysis.</I></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The statement went on to announce that a separate Strategic
Defense Technology Office was being established. The research
programme would look at five different areas: </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
   <LI>surveillance, acquisition and tracking 
   
   <LI>directed-energy weapons 
   
   <LI>kinetic energy weapons
   
   <LI>systems analysis and battle management 
   
   <LI>support programmes
</UL>

<P><I>The Technologies</I>. The aim of the SDI research programme
into surveillance, acquisition and tracking is to develop the
capabilities needed to identify targets during all phases of a
ballistic missile flight path. These complex technologies must be
such that they can operate reliably even under nuclear attack
conditions. The initial element of the programme is concerned with
detecting optical, infrared and radar signatures of re-entry
vehicles. Optical imaging using lasers rather than radar beams is
being investigated, and a substantial amount of effort is being
devoted to developing infrared sensors with near realtime signal
processing. The first demonstrated systems are expected to be a
boost-phase detection and tracking system, a midcourse long
wavelength infrared sensor for tracking and discriminating objects
during midcourse, and terminal detection systems using both optical
and radar trackers. This element of the research programme is seen as
the crucial determinant of whether defensive systems of the necessary
capability can ultimately be built.</P>

<P><I>Directed-Energy Weapons</I>. The directed-energy weapon
research programme is looking into space-based lasers, ground-based
lasers, space-based particle beams and nuclear- driven
directed-energy weapons. Research must consider the type of beam
generators, how to control the beams, and will look into the
acquisition, tracking and pointing problems, including the provision
of large optics for directing the beams. The DOD expects to be able
to demonstrate by the end of the decade 'a capability to control
wavefront errors, maintain beam alignment within the system,
compensate for atmospheric affects; and provide the components
necessary to transmit and control the high intensity beams.' The work
on large optics is not expected to come to fruition before the 1
990s. Again, once all the research on the component parts has been
carried out, an assessment can be made on whether it is possible to
move on to the more complex complete integrated system.</P>

<P><I>Kinetic Energy Weapons. </I>Less exotic is the programme for
development of appropriate kinetic energy weapons for destroying
missiles. These would include high performance interceptor missiles,
high velocity gun systems and the associated fire and guidance
control and warhead design. The practicality of a kinetic energy kill
solution to ballistic missile defence was demonstrated by the US Army
Homing Overlay Experiment (HOE) of 10 June 1984.17 In this
demonstration, an incoming ballistic missile was destroyed by an
interceptor which had been boosted out of the earth's atmosphere by a
Minuteman first and second stage. Once out of the atmosphere, the
homing stage intercepted the incoming warhead by acquiring and
tracking it with its infrared sensor. A 4.5-metre metal umbrella was
unfurled, and the kinetic energy of the collision was so great that
no explosive charge was necessary to destroy the warhead. This single
successful test (the first three had failed) cost over $300 million,
which indicates the order of magnitude of research costs in each of
these high technology areas.</P>

<P><I>System Analysis and Battlefield  Management. </I>The aim of the
system analysis and battle management programme is to develop the
technologies which will eventually allow the system to be rapidly
responsive, completely reliable and survivable while still being
controllable. Within this area the research will look into the nature
of the threat, concept of operations, system design, and the overall
technology assessments for each level of the multitiered defensive
system. Much of the research will be into high performance processors
and software, and the associated communications network. The
evaluation of the system will depend a great deal on simulation, and
development of effective simulation models will also be necessary.
</P>

<P><I>Support Programmes.</I> A major difficulty with the
establishing of a comprehensive defensive capability, is the scale of
the logistic support required. As a result, the support programme's
element will look into the energy requirements for the various
systems, and the associated logistic bill, and how it may be met.
</P>

<P><I>The Aim of SDI.</I> The evidence to the Senate Committee
concluded by saying that:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>In summary, we believe that an effective defense
against ballistic missiles could have far-reaching implications for
enhanced deterrence, greater stability, and improved opportunities
for arms control. Our efforts do not seek to replace proven policies
for maintaining the peace, but rather to strengthen their
effectiveness in the face of a growing Soviet threat. The essential
objective of the Strategic Defense Initiative is to provide future
options to diminish the risk of nuclear destruction and to increase
overall stability. By the end of the decade we will have conducted a
number of ground, airborne, and space experiments. The knowledge
gained from these tests will help to identify those technologies that
are most promising and support decisions in the early 1990s on
whether and how to proceed with development of ballistic missile
defences. The planned funding for the various areas of the Strategic
Defense Initiative are shown in Table 5.1 rising from $1 billion in
1984 to $7.4 billion in 1989.18</I></P>

<H3>THE CRITICS VIEW</H3>

<P>The critics of SDI argue that these vast sums need not be spent to
carry out research into what is already self evident. They argue that
the development of such antimissile technologies is irrelevant and
cripplingly expensive at best, and strategically dangerous at worst.
By postulating various levels of success in the technological
development, it is possible to speculate on the effects on stability
and deterrence.</P>

<P>The SDI proposals are exclusively designed to research into
counters for ballistic missiles. Nuclear threat is not exclusively
from ballistic missiles. Low altitude air-breathing systems, such as
manned aircraft and Cruise missiles, are already deployed. The use of
nuclear suitcase weapons, surface ship bombs, and even depressed
trajectory ballistic missiles, would all continue to be possible.
Indeed it is likely that deployment of such systems, which are less
easily verified for arms control purposes, would accelerate in the
light of any success in ballistic missile defence. The options for
such delivery systems mean that ballistic missile defence could not
even provide security against small nuclear powers.</P>

<P>Currently both the US and the Soviet Union have around 10,000
strategic warheads each. l9 If I per cent of those warheads exploded,
it would be sufficient to destroy the nation as a twentieth-century
power. The critics would argue that it will also be cheaper to
increase the number of warheads, to ensure that sufficient could get
through.</P>

<P>While the offence has the advantage in cost today. it is likely
that this advantage could be multiplied by a number of already
available counter-measures. These include decoys and penetration aids
to the missiles, reducing the boost-phase time for missiles, the use
of space mines, ablative surfaces on missiles, rotating missiles to
absorb directed energy and increase the power requirement. The
efficacy of these measures might be great or small: the difficulty
would be that neither side would know until deterrence failed.</P>

<P>Looking at the effect of a deployment of a ballistic missile
defence system on stability, a number of concerns have emerged. Some
have suggested that the Soviet Union would be tempted to attack
before deployment, fearing that it would be losing its nuclear
capability after an effective ballistic missile defence was in place.
It is also possible that the Soviets could perceive such a deployment
as a prelude to a Western pre- emptive first-strike strategy. In
either event, such perceptions would be destabilising.</P>

<H3>THE WAY FORWARD</H3>

<P>The SDI is not going to provide the realisation of the dream of a
world secure from nuclear threats. The research programme, for that
is what it is, being undertaken will investigate a number of very
interesting military specialisations. In the future, there will be an
increasing need to be able to counter conventional ballistic
missiles, and much of the work done on the SDI will pay off in this
respect. The sensor technologies will have a great benefit for the
weapons of tomorrow. Directed-energy systems may have a greater role
to play on the battlefield of tomorrow. Certainly improvements in
command control and communications will benefit all aspects of the
military organisation. The impetus which President Reagan's SDI has
given means that much useful military research is being undertaken.
In any event, this research is also important to ensure that
appropriate counter-measures are available should the Soviets deploy
some form of ballistic missile defensive system.</P>

<P>It is what comes beyond SDI which should be of concern. The
diversion of a large portion of US defence funds into a system of
limited capability and dubious strategic impact is not a good
prospect for Western security. It is to be hoped that the research
which both the United States and the Soviet Union are currently
undertaking into ballistic missile defence will again convince each
side of the benefits of arms control in this field.</P>
