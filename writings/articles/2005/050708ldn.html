			<h4><b>DSM: Bush's smoking gun</b></h4>

			<p>They may not have found any WMD in Iraq, but the Americans are now really excited by a new three letter acronym: DSM. The Downing Street Memo has not only ignited the policy wonks, but there is a whole industry in T-shirts and bumper stickers. Lapel badges reading &quot;Bush Lied - Read the Memo&quot; are selling well at $1.99 a piece.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The memo in question was one of a series of classified documents that have been leaked to the British media. It appears to be the official record of a meeting on Iraq which the Prime Minister held with his closest senior cabinet colleagues and advisers on 23 July 2002. This was a full nine months before the invasion took place. John Scarlett, then chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee,&nbsp; is reported as saying that the only way to overthrow Saddam was likely to be by massive military action. The head of MI6, always known as 'C', reported that Bush wanted to remove Saddam through military action, justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD. He said that the intelligence reports &quot;were being fixed around the policy&quot;. Geoff Hoon, the Defence Secretary, reported that &quot;spikes of activity&quot; had already begun to put pressure on the regime. Jack Straw, Foreign Secretary, explained the case for war was thin as Iraq's WMD capability was less than Libya, North Korea or Iran. He advocated trying to get the UN inspectors back in to help get a legal justification for the use of force. The Attorney General reminded the meeting that the desire for regime change was not a legal basis for military action. Admiral Boyce, the Chief of Defence staff, expressed uncertainty as to whether the military plan was workable. Under the Prime Minister's chairmanship, the meeting concluded that they should work on the assumption that the UK would take part in any military action.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>These extraordinary insights into the way that Blair had decided to go to war in Iraq in mid 2002, accepting the US agenda of massaging intelligence and trying to provoke Saddam, ought to cause mass protests in the streets. But we seem to have become so used to the way government spins&nbsp; to achieve its aims, that there was no noticeable effect on the Labour vote when this&nbsp; revelation appeared just four days before the election. Tony Blair's plea that we should &quot;move on&quot; seems to have worked. We now find ourselves with an overstretched army trying to hold the ring in Iraq as the chaos continues. The threat from terrorism has undoubtedly been increased&nbsp; by the illegal invasion of March 2003.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Contrast all this with the US reaction. The memo is a slow burning fuse which is now gathering speed in Washington. Senator John Kerry has called on the &nbsp;Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to speed up its investigation into how intelligence was used by the administration in building its case for war.&nbsp; Rep. John Conyers and 51 others in Congress are seeking hearings by four different Congressional committees. It is not yet Watergate, but at last the American people are beginning to ask the questions that they should have done as the drums of war beat louder from mid 2002. The US media is beginning to stand up to the Administration. The rising US military death count is only part of the explanation; Americans are becoming angry that they went to war on false information. Where it will all end, is not yet clear.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>In the UK, interest in Iraq seems to have all but disappeared.&nbsp; Iraqis are killed in large numbers. The constitutional process is in difficulty. The prognosis is not good for a stable country. The British government pledges to stay as long as the Iraqis want, while probably planning how to draw down to meet other commitments. Have the British public become so cynical that they no longer care?</p>
