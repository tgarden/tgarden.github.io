<H3><FONT SIZE="+1">A Messy World</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	In Europe, our approach to security  has changed
dramatically in the past ten years. The benchmarks for measuring our
military needs have evaporated. Our defence needs appear less urgent
to our people and their elected representatives, and the black and
white division between good guys and bad guys is much less easy. Yet
wars, between States and within States, continue, and large numbers
of people both military and civilian continue to die earlier than
necessary because of conflict. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	On the world stage, we have the novelty of a
single super-power. The USA is preeminent in terms of both economic
and military strength - and yet, because of the far sightedness of
the founding fathers, is constrained from the traditional imperialism
that goes with such power. Nevertheless,  any examination of the
utility of military power,  must now always consider the part that
the USA will play.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	The new era is messier and perhaps less
predictable than those that have gone before.  Air power proponents
have often assumed that technological improvements would provide ever
better answers to security needs, and that can still be true for
particular needs. However, as the requirements become less certain
and the international concerns less amenable to military solution, we
need to examine carefully the most resilient ways of resourcing
military capability to meet the very varied demands of the
international community.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1">Difficult Questions</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The air power planner needs to ask:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	 What we will need air power for in the
future?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	How do we live with the different scale of US
air power?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	Can we sustain political interest in providing
the necessary resources?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1">Looking Back</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	It is always easier to see the best plan with
the benefit of hindsight.  A future historian writing in the year
2100 would look back to key phases of air power. He would marvel at
the speed with which the different  main air power roles were
developed, so that virtually all had been deployed and tested in
combat within 15 years of the  first heavier than air flight. 
Technology refined the weapon systems, sensors and control 
arrangements in the furnace of World War 2. Missiles and nuclear
warheads then dominated air power application for nearly half a
century. We are in a phase now where the advent of smart weapons and
information dominance seem to be key, but we have not yet got the
historical perspective to be able to say  whether these technologies,
and their applications, will rate a chapter or just a footnote by the
year 2100. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1">Looking Forward</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	This discipline of seeing how we view the past
is sobering when we have to contemplate what provisions we should
make for the future. There is a tendency to assume that lesser powers
should follow the USA and look for high technology, power projection
capabilities. Reduction of  the risk of casualties can become a main
factor. This approach appeals  to the air power enthusiast as
aerospace systems tend to be associated with the sexiest
technologies, and are well suited to keep the butchery of war at a
safe distance from one's own citizens, even when they are in
uniform.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	There are however many counter pressures.
Throughout its brief history the provision of air power has been an
expensive undertaking. Separate air forces were necessary to ensure
the resources were used wisely both in procurement and in deployment.
Yet without some obvious national security problem, defence resources
decline. Not only is there  less cash, there is also a less obvious
need for the most advanced weapon systems. The security problem
currently seems to be more likely to be an ethnically cleansed
refugee or a starving child in Africa. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1">The Unknown Future</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">   Most defence planning tries to extrapolate the
experience of the recent past. This can lead to planning for the last
war instead of the next one. In the technology area extrapolations
are sometimes made from  small scale laboratory innovations, and 
assume that new techniques will be adopted world-wide in a very short
time. The trouble with all such forecasting is that it fails, by
definition, to take into account the unpredictable key events or
applications of technology. In international affairs, we have seen
the change in the Middle East that has resulted from an assassin's
bullet which killed Prime Minister Rabin. Integrated circuits have
changed the way that the world operates over the past 30 years. The
disasters at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl have changed world views
on the utility of nuclear energy.  Any assumptions for the future
will inevitably be proved wrong by events. Yet without assumptions
planning becomes chaotic.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1"> A Continuing World?  </FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	In any security analysis, the first question to
ask is whether there is any threat, however small, that a nation
might be totally annihilated. With the end of the Cold War, we have
reduced the risk of extinguishing life through a massive strategic
nuclear exchange. There are still more than enough nuclear weapons to
put at risk the viability of the planet, but we have more confidence
that they will not be used. To reduce the risk yet further means that
we must continue the arms reductions in this area. Military planning
must look at ways to reduce the threat of accidental nuclear use. In
India and Pakistan we should be seeking to transfer technology for
better control of their primitive nuclear systems. There is also
merit in de-alerting our own systems.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	 As the worry of a nuclear winter has receded,
we have seen new global concerns emerge: ozone layer depletion,
global warming, over-fishing, reducing biodiversity, atmospheric
pollution, reduction in fresh water sources, population growth, and
epidemics. None of these are likely to threaten the survivability of
the species in the next 30 years, but all of them represent key
problems that will need to be addressed during the period. There is
also the random possibility of a strike by an asteroid or comet, and
it may be that the risk will be seen as significant enough for work
to be needed. Indeed, some suggest that it is the sort of issue that
air power strategists should focus on. However for the purpose air
power planning, we should assume that the world will make it to 2030,
but that it will be a much more crowded, polluted and  tense
world.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1">International relations  </FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	Any plan for the future must consider the
relations between states. The power of the State appears set to
decline. In one direction, many issues need to be dealt with at the
supranational level. Regional groupings form for economic reasons
initially, but develop into political entities. The debate over a
federal Europe is all about the vision of the economic community
transforming into a political entity with its own foreign and
security policy. In other parts of the world parallel moves are
happening, but the others are all at an earlier stage than the EU.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	It is too early to say how these regional
groupings will mature: they appear in some cases to look as though
there are limits to the degree of integration possible at the
supranational level. Yet in 30 years time, it would be surprising if
some had not formed arrangements akin to superstates. One might
envisage a European, an American and an Asian set of such groupings.
They might by then be co-operating or competing. From a defence
planning perspective one needs to make judgments about the future of
the US relationship.   </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	While many of the potential problems of today
and tomorrow need a supranational approach, there is also a tendency
for power to move downward from States to individuals. The widening
recognition of the need to protect human rights, the wish for ethnic
groups to have self determination, increasing access to information,
increasing education of women, and the ability of individuals to
communicate globally, are all pointers to a future where States may
decline in power, and in some cases even break up into smaller parts.
   </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1">United Nations</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	At the supranational level, the development of
global organisations will also be important. The United Nations may
be very different. It might have become more effective in its
decision-making, have the power to implement decisions, and be an
effective monitor of international behaviour. Perhaps, more likely,
it will have become less effective as the membership of the Security
Council is expanded, and decision making becomes more difficult.
Certainly the signs are that the process of changing the membership
may itself be damaging as arguments break out of which nations should
represent particular regions. Many would argue for a future where the
UN could act as the world's policeman with appropriate forces on hand
to enforce international law.The World Trade Organisation may  have
developed to be a far more important entity in moderating
international behaviour. We are in the early days yet, and there are
plenty of opportunities for it to lose power. However, given the
universal advantage in well regulated trade arrangements, it may be
that WTO is a better horse to back as a future global coordinator.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1">European Union</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	We have a perception today that the states of
Western Europe, including the UK, are stable, co-operative, rich and
technologically advanced. We worry about high costs of labour, we
enjoy reasonable growth, albeit with unemployment a problem for many
of the countries. We look to an expansion of this sphere of stability
to encompass Central and Eastern Europe. New members of the EU come
on stream within 5 years, and we expect that process to continue.
Problems may include the former Yugoslavia, Russia and the North
African littoral states. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	There are  black scenarios which might look at
today as being the peak of EU development as the strains of greater
integration, and monetary union in particular, lead to a fracturing
of the carefully built consensus. Or that the strains of taking on
new members, without some fundamental reforms of the CAP, cause the
EU to stultify. Or that the great Russian democratic experiment fails
with a fall into complete lawlessness, anarchy or military coup. Or
that the populous poor of North Africa repeat the Islamic invasion of
the past, this time seeking food rather than conquest. All these are
possible, but perhaps less likely than a progressive extension of the
EU strengthening security and prosperity in Europe.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1">Middle East</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	However, at the Eastern end of the Mediterranean
there is a more intractable problem between Israel and its
neighbouring states. 30 years ago Arab/Israeli wars happened, and it
may be that will remain possible for many years to come. Until there
is a harmonious relationship between an Israel that feels safe and a
viable Palestinian state, it is likely to remain a future worry. For
the remainder of the Middle East, and perhaps in the Caucasus as
well, the availability of oil is likely to be a factor which is of
increasing interest to the rest of the world.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"> 	Some fear Fundamental Islam as a unifying force
which will change the political face of the globe. More likely, the
differences within the factions of Islam are more than enough to
prevent such a single force operating in the next 30 years. Nor do
the predictions of Samuel Huntington, who has written of a clash of
civilisations, seem probable. Nevertheless,  a global system of
individual rights and democracy will remain difficult to implement.
We remain to an extent prisoners of the present when thinking of the
Middle East. Thus we will worry about Iran and Iraq, but it may be
that there will emerge other personalities to worry us. Egypt has a
problem with fundamentalists, which it currently contains, but at the
price of slowing up economic reform. Saudi Arabia is not without its
potential difficulties. Recent terrorist acts in Africa have
highlighted the potential reach of groups based in
Afghanistan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"> </FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1">Asia-Pacific</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The Asia Pacific region defies the forecaster.
Here we have two questions to consider: first, and most importantly,
where will China be in 30 years time; and second what of the ASEAN
nations? Again we find ourselves trapped in extrapolations of what is
happening at the moment. We flip-flop from overoptimistic assumptions
of prolonged double digit growth to assuming that the current crisis
may be the end of the tiger economies. In 30 years, the region will
be more populous and more developed. It will be consuming more
resources and more energy. It may or may not be peaceful, and China
will be a much more significant player in the world. All this
suggests that there is much to be said for engaging China and drawing
it into the global institutions such as the WTO.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	 Japan is more difficult to assess. It seems to
be finding great difficulty in adapting fast enough to the new global
markets. Certainly the Japanese opinion formers are acutely aware of
the need for reform. Yet it may not be able to reform, and a collapse
of Japan would have major security implications. Korea still has the
possibility to surprise the world, and perhaps not in a pleasant way.
In this look at the future, we can postulate either a unified Korea
or a war devastated peninsular. Either are possible. Nor is the
Indian subcontinent's future assured. There are good signs with the
increase of high technology industry in India, but it has not got its
population problem under control. War with Pakistan remains possible,
but is perhaps less likely  given that it could have a nuclear
dimension.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1">Africa</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	If we look at Africa, it is difficult to
envisage any rapid answer to the many problems of the continent. The
triumph of the return to democracy in South Africa, and also in
Mozambique and Namibia gives hope for a region of increasing
stability and prosperity in the South. Yet criminality could still
undermine that, and it will be many years before such potential
prosperity would encompass Central Africa. It seems likely that the
world will have to help the continent throughout the next 30 years.
Whether the richer nations will continue to be willing to do so is
another question.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1">The Americas</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	In Latin America, the move away from military
dictatorships to democracies has been a good development over the
past few years. There are some thriving economies with great
potential. Yet crime and corruption, often drug related, remains a
significant problem. Environmental issues are also likely to cause
tensions between the developed world and some South American states. 
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	However, the most important question for future
security planning is how the United States of America approaches
future problems. The world will be very different depending on
whether the US becomes the world's policeman or retreats into
regional isolation. The implications for the sort of investment that
Europe should make in security depends critically on this issue.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1">Future Technology  </FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	The uncertainties of the future international
political and economic scene are not the only difficulties for
defence planning. Predicting the implications of technology is
equally impossible. It is a common perception that we are in a time
of unprecedented rate of technological change. In some respects this
is true, but there are some important caveats to be made. At the end
of the last century, scientists were beginning to think they were
within sight of having an explanation for everything. Indeed
scientific discovery and technological application to industrial
processes was remarkable then. There is perhaps a need to introduce
the concept of effective technology. Thus we have had heavier than
air flight for just short of a century, jet engines for half that
time. We have developed technology which allows us to fly at
supersonic speeds, but with a few exceptions, most air travel
continues to be at the same high subsonic speed that we have enjoyed
for the past 30 years. If you wish to improve transit times between
London and New York, a better return is achieved by speeding up the
process of getting from the centre of each city to the aircraft
before it takes off. Similarly the car has peaked in its effective
speed. The Thrust team have demonstrated that we have the technology
for a supersonic car, but the speed of traffic through cities is
declining.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	None of this is to suggest a Luddite view of
pure and applied research. It is more to point to the disparity
between the extrapolation of the laboratory experiment to full scale
production in the sort of societies that we anticipate. In the 60s,
we thought about about the exciting possible future applications for
lasers. While these included  directed energy weapons, they have been
rather slow to be realised. Yet nobody suggested that many homes
would have a laser in the successor to the gramophone or every office
one in its successor to the typewriter.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	With all these uncertainties, what are the
technologies which will affect security over the next 30 years?  They
 will almost certainly include: materials science, nanotechnology,
genetic engineering, medicine, novel manufacturing techniques,
non-lethal warfare, yet more in communications and computing. The use
of space  will be a fruitful area as well.The trend away from defence
being in the lead on R&amp;D towards the greater exploitation of
civil technologies will continue. We need to concentrate defence
research resources in the few narrow fields where civil research will
not help.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1">Military Power</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	We can draw a few conclusions for military
power. There is sufficient uncertainty in the immediate future to
make it necessary for any government to invest in providing for its
citizens' security. The more responsible, and wealthier, nations
should also be prepared to providing a contribution towards
international stability even when not directly threatened. That
agenda will give rise to an unquantifiable and potentially limitless
military requirement. Against the sorts of scenarios that are
discussed above, you could build up any force requirement that you
wished. This has been the problem in defence planning since the end
of the Cold War. In the end, the investment will be cost limited in a
fairly arbitrary way. The figure for many nations is around the 2% of
GDP level.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	The air power enthusiast will make the case for
the special contribution that air systems can make to so many of
these future operations.  The question is whether, for a resource
constrained nation where the direct threat is low, the attractions of
high cost air systems will be self evident. The combat unit numbers
will inevitably be low, and the support overheads proportionately
higher.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1">New Possibilities in New Worlds</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	One could suggest two possible futures for air
power. Doubtless neither will come to pass but perhaps they bound the
range of possibilities. First the developed world can  continue on
its current path. We feel secure from major military threat, and we
see our security concerns as the results of crime, poverty and
environmental degradation.  Military forces continue to be useful to
help diplomatic effort, and do the emergency jobs that no-one else is
willing to do. When conflicts or other situations which require
international intervention occur, we will look to the UN for
authority, and to the US for capability. Over a period of time, those
who wish to participate will have to follow the US lead in air power
equipment and doctrine if they are to be able to take part in
integrated operations. An increasing dependence on both US presence
and US defence industries will cause governments to question even
more whether they are wise to invest in expensive air systems, which
in any event are always just a part of a bigger  and better US force.
 They will tend to use their defence money for the ground forces
which will be needed in virtually every type of operation, and can be
made interoperable with the US at lower cost.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	The other end of spectrum of possibilities would
require air power to be procured, trained, and operated at above the
national level. Just as in the first world war, air warfare  become
too expensive and important to be left to the army and navy, it may
be that we are coming to a stage where this is true for individual
nations.  NATO AWACs has shown that it is possible for nations to
club together to deploy a very expensive, high technology, key air
power asset. It is strange that the great burst towards multinational
forces has been led by ground formations. While our air forces
operate together routinely without any problem, that is not the
answer to the problems of economies of scale. Air forces are uniquely
easy to operate on a multinational basis - the language of the air is
English, the procedures are international. If medium sized nations
are to field air power capabilities of significance, they will need
to merge their research, development, procurement, training, and
operational capability. This is quite an undertaking, but not
impossible and would of course go hand in hand with a stronger
European defence aerospace industry and a real European Security and
Defence Identity.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1">A Watershed?</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	We do not debate the implications of the long
term decline in capabilities often enough. It would be politically
difficult (particularly for the UK) to make air forces operate at the
supranational level, but if we are all planning to carry out military
operations at the supranational level, perhaps it is time to think
how we might make it come to pass. One could conceive of a European
air force perhaps as a WEU  owned force. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	This is not a possibility for the immediate
future:  it is however an alternative to the inevitable decline of
European air power capability in a world where military operations
are discretionary rather than compulsory. Air power has thrived on
adapting to new challenges and exploiting new opportunities, and
there are plenty of those in the new era. The UK air power planners
of today need to be thinking about ways in which Europe can operate
its air power on a more equal basis with the United States.</FONT>
