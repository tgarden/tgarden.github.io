<H3>New elements of Security</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The end of the Cold War has brought into sharper focus the many
aspects of security which are beyond the stark fear of loss of
territorial integrity, which has characterised national defence
policies for so long. These new security concerns, sometimes
characterised as soft security issues, were not all born as a result
of the end of the superpower confrontation, but have assumed
relatively greater importance now that the threat of a nuclear global
war has declined so markedly. Technology has an impact on these new
security concerns, and just as in the more traditional defence field,
the impact of technology can be for good or ill. In this short
presentation, I shall cover those aspects of wider security concerns
in which it seems that technology is a key factor, and what this may
mean for public policy.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Governments are expected to take steps to ensure the security of
their citizens. While in the traditional narrow sense this has meant
adopting a defence policy which provides appropriate military and
diplomatic capability to deter, or if necessary repel, any threat to
national vital interests, we now look to appropriate provision for
the current - and perhaps as importantly future - well-being of our
citizens. We can thus think of security in terms of protecting our
citizens from a number of potential ills. Physical violence against
citizens may come from war, from terrorism or from crime. It can also
come from nature in the form of natural disasters: earthquake,
floods, fires, famine and hurricanes. Citizens expect governments to
protect them from early death or disability, and so the control of
disease becomes a security issue in this brave new world. We also
expect our children and grandchildren to be protected from current
activities which may harm them in the future. Environmental issues
become vital interests for nations, particularly when the economic
effects of today have to be offset against the environmental effects
of tomorrow.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>We live in a time of extraordinary technological change. It is not
a new development that economic success is every bit as important to
national security as the provision of a sufficient military
capability. The interdependence of the world in the economic field
has made this a much more complex area for public policy, and new
national vulnerabilities have emerged which are exacerbated by
technological developments.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In brief, national security must consider the classic threats to
territorial integrity and vital interests, and in addition add the
concerns about terrorism, crime (both internal and international),
disease, poverty, migration (either for economic or terror reasons),
environmental and pollution threats, access to and availability of
required natural resources, economic viability and vulnerability to
external actors.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>If we have a number of new concerns which fall into the security
category, we also have a bewildering number of technologies which
affect these new threats for good or ill. Perhaps the most important
examples of these are the developments in information technology and
biotechnology. This is not to ignore the important roles that the
many other research fields in mathematics, chemistry and physics are
having, and I shall touch on some of those as well. However to try to
contain my topic to manageable proportions, let me just look at these
two - information technology and biotechnology - for a moment.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Information Technology</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>We have grown used to the effects of Moore's Law, the doubling of
computing power every 18 months. I bought my first personal computer
just 20 years ago. It cost just on &#163;3000 at today's prices and
it had 8k Ram. Compare that with today's desktop machines which have
the power of yesterday's supercomputers, Ram of 64 Mb and can be
bought in a supermarket for less than &#163;1000. The Y2K, the
Millennium Bug, problem has brought home to us how dependent we have
become on computers in every form. Integrated circuits, which so
reduced the cost of manufacturing electronic devices through mass
production techniques, are in every corner of society. They have
given us extraordinary benefits in cost reduction and in capability
increase in devices from the egg timer to the space shuttle. Yet
dependence carries with it new vulnerabilities. The Millennium Bug is
a security issue. If fly by wire aircraft crash, international
financial transactions are scrambled, and nuclear power station
controls malfunction through a program bug - the effects are real,
and governments are expected to safeguard citizens from the
consequences. Perhaps we should be grateful to those early Cobol
programmers for leaving this legacy to remind us not to abandon the
normal manual safeguards</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>If we expand the information technology concerns to the
implications of interconnected systems, we have an area that gives
rise to a number of extra security concerns. Many of you will be
aware in the military sphere of the focus, particularly in the United
States on Information Warfare - an omnibus title that encompasses
many of the military strengths and weakness that arise from the new
reliance on computing power, communications and connectivity. I will
not spend too much time on this as we can come back to it in our
discussions. Suffice it to say, that from a military point of view
information warfare is nothing new - the technologies and techniques
may be novel, but the battle and counter-battle in the the
information field has a long history.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>What is new are the non-military security concerns which stem from
the wired world. The electronic global banking system offers
opportunities to the high tech criminal or the terrorist. There are
worries that enemy states might be able to disrupt economies by
hacking such systems. Protective measures are needed for commercial
reasons, but there seems little doubt that any computer connected to
an external communications system is at risk. It is fascinating
watching the internet community at work breaking new encryption
techniques, offering advice on the ways to get through firewalls, and
designing ever more malignant viruses, trojan horses and worms. Nor
do you have to be a computer whizz to cause catastrophic failure of
data systems. A small quantity of crude explosive at a key node in a
system is always an alternative for the less technically able
terrorist. We have therefore new vulnerabilities across a range of
key systems in banking, energy, air traffic, and a thousand other
parts of a modern society's infrastructure that are potentially more
vulnerable as a result of new technology.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Perhaps one other aspect of the internet and security that is
important to this audience is the empowerment of individuals with
information. It is now ever more difficult to keep secrets.
Information flashes around the world, and coupled with satellite
phone systems, pictures, sound and information is available
instantaneously everywhere. This should not be a problem for liberal
democracies most of the time, but it will embarrass on occasions. It
is of course also a very effective and cheap way to propagate
misinformation, which may be a security concern as single issue
groups try to change public opinion. I think on balance however this
aspect of the internet has many more positive aspects for liberal
democracies.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Biotechnology</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Let me turn to the second major example of how technology is
changing our definition of security. The field of biotechnology is
perhaps at the stage that the information revolution was at 30 years
ago. It took two decades of research to move from Crick and Watson's
discovery of how genetic information was stored and replicated
through the double helix structure of the Deoxyribonucleic acid - DNA
- molecule, to developing techniques for manipulating these genetic
codes. Now, we are making progress in mapping the human genome,
assisted by the computing power that is now available. Genetic
engineering is refining techniques for altering the characteristics
of any living things from viruses to mammals. The prospect of being
able to select required characteristics and then replicate through
cloning is already moving from the laboratory into the commercial
field as we see with the current interest in genetically modified
foods. This new technology is still in its infancy, and like so many
advances can be used for good or ill. It also introduces new concerns
about unintended consequences.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In the direct military security field, we are of course worried by
the implications of biotechnology for new forms of biological
warfare. Although BW is not new - the Mongols used plague corpses in
1346 to infect the defenders at the siege of Caffa - it has been used
rarely as a weapon of war and to no great effect. From a military
point of view, BW has been unpredictable, unreliable and slow. As a
terror weapon, disease does have greater potential, but again the
bomb has been the preferred weapon of terrorist through the ages for
its immediacy, predictability and ease of manufacture. These
limitations on the efficacy of BW weapons may change significantly as
agents can be tailored to have particular characteristics. An agent
with the speed and deadliness of the ebola virus might be given the
infectivity of 'flu, and perhaps even more terrifyingly be designed
to target people with particular genetic markers. This would be a
weapon that targeted ethnic groups. It is encouraging that the
Biological Weapons Convention has been formulated ahead of the
development of such weapons. However, the problems of verification
are immense, and as genetic engineering becomes more commonplace, as
every human gene is mapped and labelled, and biotechnology moves from
the laboratory to the workplace, the risks will rise significantly.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Let me not leave you with an unmitigated vision of gloom, because
as with most technology in the weapons field it can be applied to the
defence as well as the offence. We can expect genetic engineering to
provide fast detectors of threat and antidotes. However as the search
for a cure for HIV/AIDS has shown, finding successful techniques is
not easy.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>But we are talking about new and wider security concerns that stem
from technological developments. I shall not rehearse the arguments
currently in play over the question of GM crops. It is clear that
there is a wider security issue in terms of the health of
populations. We may be able to use biotechnology to provide more food
for the world, and hence reduce one of the long term security
concerns, but if the unintended consequence is a repeat of the DDT
problem, or the BSE crisis, the net effect may not be to enhance the
safety of our peoples.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Biotechnology really is in its infancy, and the effects on the
world can only be guessed at. As we design organisms for specific
purposes, we may find that we will be able to use microbes to produce
oil substitutes directly from plants, just in the same way as yeast
produces alcohol from sugars. This could bring geostrategic changes
if the importance of underground oil was diminished. We may see the
next stage of improving integrated circuit density being achieved by
growing the circuits. Bio chips might then replicate themselves and
be self repairing.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Other technologies</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>As I said in my opening remarks, we are now having to address a
much wider range of security concerns and some will stem from new
technologies and some will find their solution through technical
advances. The world's need for energy, and the consequent effect on
the environment, is a growing security issue. The problem is not
generated by technology - global warming, pollution and decreasing
biodiversity - will come from old fashioned energy generation using
fossil fuel. The solution to the problem may come from a mix of new
technologies. Some of the most exciting possibilities for the future
may come from nanotechnology. Already machines of atomic dimension
are beginning to be realised in the laboratory. The implications of
these developments are in time possibly going to rival the
information revolution and the possibilities we are now realising
through biotechnology.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>The New Security Agenda</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>As we meet, the security concerns are less those posed by new
technologies, but more those defined by deep historical divides
dating from 600 years of history in the Balkans. New technologies in
terms of sensors, satellite navigation, smart weapons, stealth,
cruise missiles, laser designation, electronic warfare, real time
intelligence and all the gadgets of modern warfare are on show. Yet
the nature of the conflict is not affected by the technology. The
effectiveness of the systems may be orders of magnitude greater than
those of the World War 2, but we still see an air campaign with a
traditional sequence of targets. Interestingly one of the major
concerns that is emerging in NATO is the likely difficulty of
interoperability between allies as US technology continues to draw
further ahead. Again terrorists still prefer the old fashioned bomb
as a weapon of terror. Technology offers more effective
counter-measures, but the ability for terrorists to cause havoc
remains. Our worries about nuclear weapons tend to stem from old
systems ("loose nukes") which might be sold on, rather than new
technology. The decreasing expenditure on defence budgets will also
slow up the introduction of new technology to armed forces.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The vulnerabilities that I have touched upon are all aspects of
the technologically based society. This is not new. As countries
industrialised they became more dependent on a complex
infrastructure, which gave new vulnerabilities. The failure of one
electric power sub-station can knock out whole districts for
prolonged periods, with further cascading effects on other parts of
society. The incorrect handling of a nuclear power station can cause
contamination across a continent. As we learn to rely on the benefits
of technology, we introduce new dependencies and hence new
vulnerabilities.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The most important need is for policy makers to have a sound
understanding of all the implications of new technologies. Many
nations underinvest in the key research areas for wider security
needs. In a book that I wrote ten years ago (The Technology Trap) , I
concluded that we needed more scientists in the corridors of
government. I think the need is now even more urgent.</P>
