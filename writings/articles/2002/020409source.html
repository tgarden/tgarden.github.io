			<h3>No Barbecues for Bush and Blair</h3>

			<p>The much trailed informal weekend for Tony Blair at George W. Bush's farm in Texas turned into a more formal summit meeting. The combination of the period of official mourning for the Queen Mother, and the heavy rain in Texas made lighting the Presidential barbecue less than wise. But the agenda for these two key leaders was also one which would have suffered from too much of the party atmosphere. Originally they were expected to focus on Iraq. The noises from Washington continued to speak of military action relatively soon with the aim of removing Saddam Hussein. Tony Blair appears to have sympathy with the US approach, but has the Cabinet, the Foreign Office and much of the Labour Party worried about the legality and wisdom of such an attack on Iraq. The MOD is concerned about the ever increasing commitments for UK forces, and the lack of any sign of relief in terms of their budget shortfall. Nor is there great enthusiasm in Europe for a second Gulf War. <br>
				<br>
				But the discussion time on Iraq was much reduced by the more pressing problem of Israel. The Bush-Blair meeting was doubtless made somewhat easier by the President's call for Israel to withdraw from Palestinian towns &quot;without delay&quot;. Condoleeza Rice explained to Israel that the President meant that withdrawal was  &quot;to begin now. Without delay. Not tomorrow. Not when Secretary Powell gets to the region. But now.&quot;  Interestingly, the Jerusalem Post reported Israeli officials as saying the operative phrase from Bush was &quot;begin to withdraw&quot;. At the joint Texas press conference, George Bush was asked what he would do if Israel failed to withdraw. He could not conceive of the possibility. Time will tell. Doubtless, he had received reports of the anti-American demonstrations in Saudi Arabia, which has resulted in US citizens being advised to stay off the streets. Turkey is also finding it difficult to maintain its co-operative position with Israel in the current situation. <br>
				<br>
				It is becoming clearer by the day that any action against Iraq will be much more dangerous and difficult if there is not some lowering of the violence in the Israel-Palestine crisis. Forward mounting bases will be difficult to find if the US is seen as complicit in the Israel operations within the Occupied Territories. Already it appears that the US is looking to Qatar as a possible alternative headquarters to Saudi Arabia. There is also the possibility that Saddam Hussein might see advantage in trying further  to destabilise the situation if he thinks an attack on Iraq is imminent. The announcement that he is to turn off oil sales shows that he is prepared to take on the West in a number of different ways. Doubtless Bush and Blair will have been briefed on some of the possible scenarios.<br>
				<br>
				But there were other issues that the two leaders should have fitted in. The US tariffs on steel remain a running sore in transatlantic relations. Nor has Europe given up on trying to reduce the global warming problem through the Kyoto process. It may be that Tony Blair found it difficult to fit these worries into the Iraq and Israel private discussions. The continuing war on terror and the rebuilding of Afghanistan would also have needed some debate. What Blair was able to do was sweep up all the great swathe of transatlantic concerns and hopes into his set piece speech at the Bush Senior Presidential Library at the end of the visit. <br>
				<br>
				The Blair speech sits well with his Chicago presentation in April 1999, and his speech to the Brighton Conference last September. By the time he leaves office a collection of his major speeches will be essential reading for any student of international affairs. In this Texas speech he argued that the utilitarian and Utopian views of foreign policy were merging. He reminded his audience that he has already  as Prime Minister been involved in three conflicts which brought about regime changes: Milosevic, the Taliban and Sierra Leone. He underlined the need for the US and the EU to work together to fight international terrorism and to prevent the development of weapons of mass destruction. <br>
				<br>
				His speech seemed as much directed at keeping the USA engaged in international affairs, as one showing support for current US policies. It addressed the current causes of disagreement across the Atlantic, but argued that there was a much more important agenda, which required the US and Europe acting together as international players. As Tony Blair returned to London, he could feel pleased by the achievements of the weekend. He had reinforced the UK-US relationship, and had filled in some more detail into his picture of the future of world affairs. He was accused recently of having no political philosophy. This is certainly not true when it comes to foreign policy.<br>
