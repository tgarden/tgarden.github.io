<H4><CENTER>IISS Conference: The Links between Economics and Strategy
</CENTER></H4>

<H4><CENTER>Panel 1: Is defence affordable?</CENTER></H4>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>As always I enjoyed reading a piece by Ed Luttwak. He never minces
words; quotes concrete examples to support his thesis; and leaves the
reader wondering how the rest of the world can be so dumb. And yet?
Our conference topic is to explore the links between economics and
strategy, and this panel has been asked to address the fundamental
question "Is defence affordable". Ed's paper addresses this by
identifying two broad aspects of the US defence programme where he
believes that different priorities or arrangements could produce more
appropriate capability at less cost. He blames the inefficiencies
that he identifies on the persistence of the peculiar military
culture of the Cold War among the military professionals and
associated civilians. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I am not qualified to comment on the internal policy making of the
US, and I imagine there will be plenty of experts in this panel to
discuss the more obscure details. My views will of course be coloured
by being one of the military professionals who was involved
continuously in the policy and programme development process for the
UK from 1987 until earlier this year. The difficulties of that
process - bridging the arms control activity, the end of the Cold
War, the Gulf War and now the expansion of UN peacekeeping operations
- is however much the same in any of the NATO Defence and Foreign
Ministries. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In this brief response, I will comment on the relevance of Ed's
paper, and then try to expand the agenda so that we address the wider
question set for this panel. The first question must of course be
what are the military forces being asked to prepare for? This is of
course not a question to be answered by either the military
professionals or their associated civilians. It is the job of the
politicians to decide what tasks they put upon us. To this extent, Ed
is right about the Cold War culture. For forty years,the policy
direction was simple, easily understood, and relatively easily
translated into defence programmes. The implications of a NATO/Warsaw
Pact fighting war were also so self evidently catastrophic that funds
for Defence were more easily justified, and were held at an unusually
high percentage of nation's GDPs for a period without fighting.
Defence at levels of 4-6% of GDP was affordable. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Even then of course there were different views on where the
priorities for spending were. Yes, vested interests abounded. Whether
it was inter-Service, industrial needs, pork-barrel politics or just
independent academic opinion. Some of us will remember the 1988 IISS
conference in Brighton  where we looked at The Changing Strategic
Landscape. In a powerful paper then, Ed argued that the "European
peace of recent decades is too precious to be recklessly gambled on
fragile theories of non-nuclear adequacy, inherent Soviet restraint
or inevitable Soviet decline". He concluded that a new force of
nuclear weapons represented the only alternative. At the time I
agreed. But the world has changed in a way that none of foresaw only
six years ago. At the same time our equipment procurement cycle moves
in timescales measured in decades. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	</P>

<P>Starting then with the question of what do we need our forces for?
In simple terms none of the NATO nations are planning now on the
basis of an immediate threat to their national survival. If defence
were affordable in the past when they were planning against such a
contingency, then it seems pretty self evident that it must be
affordable at this new lower scale of risk. The question is as ever
whether the match between resources, commitments and capabilities
have been made. The US has made a fairly clear exposition of its
scale of commitment in the bottom-up review. The ability to carry out
two near simultaneous Gulf scale operations is a fairly demanding
scenario. It is likely to leave sufficient spare capacity in more
normal times to meet the plethora of other operations which
politicians expect military forces to undertake. In the UK,
contributing to NATO remains a key driver of force scale and
structure, but it is done with the wider utility and employment of
such forces in mind. Last year we carried out an exercise with the
Foreign Office and Treasury to agree what forces were needed to
underpin foreign policy, look at where we could double and triple
earmark, where capabilities might be duplicated. The Government
published the analysis for all to see. Other European countries are
taking a similar approach. Force structures are determined by an
analysis of the bounds of operations which each country's foreign
policy suggest may be likely. There are local peculiarities - for us
the Northern Ireland operation has an effect on the size of the army.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Against these difficulties of planning, I will turn to the two
specific areas which Ed's paper focuses on, before giving some
thoughts on other areas which I think this panel might want to
address in its discussions. The first theme of Ed's paper is the
urge to modernize all weapons as quickly as possible. This is
scarcely a surprising urge among military men, as when called upon to
put their lives at risk, they would prefer to be operating with the
best weapons and platforms. Nor is it surprising that enthusiasm
abounds in the industrial and research communities. None of this
derives necessarily from being locked in the Cold War culture. Even
in the Cold War time, priorities had to be established between
competing projects for finite funds. The funds were greater then, but
even so we have all been to conferences agonising over the
remorseless rise in the costs of new equipment and how to square the
circle of increasing capability against decreasing numbers. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I have no argument with the conclusion at para 14 that the answer
is not to stop all R&amp;D but become more selective. The money saved
would be ploughed back into training. Well maybe, but the needs of
different nations, different Services and different servicemen
require a close examination of the relative priorities - and I shall
come back to that. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The second theme of Ed's paper is the question of Readiness and
the urge to maintain a fast operational tempo. He postulates a new
system of stratified combat readiness where degrees of combat
readiness are rotated around units rather than keeping all at the
highest states. Again I have absolutely no problem with the key
requirement to review readiness assumptions for the new strategic
situation. Work on this may have at times moved more slowly than some
of us would have wished, but at times the need to carry Allies for a
coherent approach to readiness states has slowed things up. Again we
have got to remember the extraordinary change that has taken place in
our basic planning assumptions over this period. Readiness has
changed markedly - and there is no doubt that greater changes could
be made. The paper makes much of the perceived need to keep morale
high through the challeng of high readiness. Although, this may be
one factor, it is not one which I would use to defend unnecessary
expenditure. Morale and interest can be maintained through
imaginative training and leadership. The real question is what is the
appropriate mix of readiness for forces. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>To give you some feel for the nature of the problem, it is worth
considering the role of Reserves and conscripts. The move to all
volunteer forces is a natural change as nations feel less directly
threatened. Just because the UK and the US had already made this move
in earlier years, we should not forget that it is a significant
change in approach for many nations. Reserves are a more difficult
area. There is a relationship between warning and preparation time
and the state of readiness of regulars and reserves. In the cold war,
again assumptions were relatively simple. Short warning and
preparation time for a major mobilisation. Both regulars and reserves
needed to be pretty close to combat ready. Immediate aftermath of the
Cold War, there were worries of the possibility of a reversal of the
changes in the FSU, but an acknowledgment that warning and
preparation time had moved from hours to months. Now the advantages
of Reserves appeared great. It would be possible to accept their
lower readiness, because there would be time to train them up for the
major war. As that warning and preparation time extends from the
months to years, there must coem a point where you could start the
training from scratch if you needed to, and the necessity for any
training for Reserves needs to be asked. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>On this model, you scale, equip and train your regular forces for
the immediate tasks that their governments require them to be
prepared for. And here I think it is disingenuous to suggest that
providing water in Rwanda is the extent of these demands. Indeed if
that were the most demanding undertaking envisaged for military
forces, it would be better to disband the regulars as well, and equip
and fund a civilan band of specialists. </P>
