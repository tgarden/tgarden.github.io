<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In the same week that the RAF reminds the
nation of its triumph in the  Battle of Britain 60 years ago, the
National Audit Office publishes a detailed and devastating analysis
of its current pilot shortage problem.  There were 71 Fighter Command
squadrons which took part in the Battle of Britain; today the RAF has
just 5 air defence squadrons. Of the 2927 airmen, who took part, 544
were killed in the Battle; today the RAF is established for only 540
pilots to cover all the fast jet roles, and yet an 18% shortfall will
worsen to 25% by 2003.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Although the report "Training new pilots"
only covers the process from recruitment to operational
qualification, it shines some light on why there is an acute and
worsening pilot manning crisis. The report covers all 3 Services and
all types of military pilot. It should be read widely as it shows how
a lack of joined-up management can make a bad situation even worse.
Efficiency measures ( a favourite MOD activity) translate into local
savings which raise costs further down the training machine. Cutbacks
in the frontline translate into backlogs in the training machine. It
can now take 6 years, rather than the planned 3 years, to train a
pilot and cost nearly &#163;5.7 million per person. The NAO even
quantify the cost of empty cockpits at another &#163;6 million per
year. The current input targets cannot rectify the shortfalls before
2012. The extended training times reduce the amount of useful
operational service that each pilot can give. All this means that the
few trained pilots  must work harder and be on operations more often,
with adverse effects on retention. The problem worsens. The report
highlights some of the added difficulties resulting from the
contractorisation of various aspects of the training system.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Rightly, the NAO has identified the complex
interaction of the multitude of factors which influence the output of
the pilot training process. There is no single simple solution to the
problem. Retention measures will have an important role to play, and
in the end will have to be in the form of financial incentives. If
each empty cockpit is costed by the NAO at &#163;6 million per year,
it should be possible to justify a quite generous progressive
retention scheme. The pilot training system will also need greater
investment, and most of all will need to return to a more flexible
arrangement, which will  entail a degree of overprovision. </FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Government can take some comfort that
what would have made a good press story in Battle of Britain week was
just about buried by the fuel crisis. Even so, this is a problem
which is not going to go away. British armed forces without pilots
will be pretty constrained in what they can do in any future
operations. </FONT></P>
