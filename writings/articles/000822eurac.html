<H4><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Challenge</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	We  Europeans are living at an exciting
and critical time for the future of our security arrangements. We
have the opportunity to move forward to a defence posture that will
make the world safer, NATO stronger and Europe more secure. It will
be a tragedy if we fail to seize the moment. We have grown used to
the security blanket that NATO gave us throughout the Cold War, but
the world has changed, and we must respond to that change. In this
final presentation of the symposium, I would like to give a personal
view on the nature of the challenge; why the future shape our air
power is so important; the difficulties we face; the limitations of
the current approach; and finally my thoughts on an alternative
approach which would bring us real affordable capabilities in short
timescales.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"> 	The end of the Cold War left  NATO with a
vast and expensive set of military forces, which had been training to
fight a single campaign for over 40 years. Yet through the 1990's,
the Western nations have had to undertake more diverse military
action, under various banners, than at any time previously.  Kuwait,
Iraq, Somalia, Rwanda, Bosnia, Haiti, Albania, Kosovo and East Timor
have seen western military force deployed to less than benign
environments. A new doctrine for peace support operations has
replaced the manuals on flexible response and the air-land battle in
the military staff colleges of the Alliance. This series of military
experiences is sufficient now to have established a strong consensus
on the new rationale for NATO, which was articulated in the Strategic
Concept launched at the NATO summit in Washington in April 1999. The
accumulation of data from real operations, rather than deterrence
postures, has highlighted major shortcomings in the security
capabilities available to the Alliance for these new tasks. </FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	In the chronology of the NATO Summit, the
EU security developments, which culminated in Helsinki, and the
Kosovo war, it is often now forgotten that the worries about European
military weaknesses pre-dated the test of the Kosovo campaign. The
Gulf  War had shown that the US was both quantitatively and
qualitatively in a different  capability league from all the other
nations involved. In the air, it was a war primarily of offensive air
operations, and these had to be conducted from medium to high
altitudes, where advanced defence suppression methods were more
effective. The European military equipment was not well structured to
the new doctrine. The gap in capability across the Atlantic widened
through the 1990's, particularly in air power systems.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT COLOR="#000000">The current approach to European
Defence</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	In any look at the current approach to
European defence, we must not lose sight of the NATO dimension while
being focused on the EU work. The new NATO Strategic Concept  
recognised the changes in the strategic environment since the 1991
NATO Strategic Concept was produced. Many of the elements were
directly relevant to the need to reshape European defence
capabilities. In particular:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><UL>
   <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">-- Military Capabilities: The Concept
   reaffirms Allies' determination to strengthen Alliance defence
   capabilities by ensuring forces thatare more mobile, sustainable,
   survivable and able to engage effectively on the full spectrum of
   NATO missions.</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><UL>
   <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">-- New Missions: The Concept calls for
   improvements in NATO's capability to undertake new missions to
   respond to a broad spectrum of possible threats to Alliance common
   interests, including: regional conflicts, such as in Kosovo and
   Bosnia; the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their
   means of delivery; and transnational threats like
   terrorism.</FONT>

<BLOCKQUOTE><UL>
   <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">-- European Capabilities: The Concept
   highlights development of a European Security and Defence Identity
   within NATO as an essential element of NATO's ongoing adaptation,
   enabling European allies to make a more effective contribution to
   Euro-Atlantic security.</FONT>
</UL></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">This last bullet of the Strategic Concept
recognised the work that been going on in parallel to develop a more
coherent EU approach to foreign and security policy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The development of a coherent defence
policy for the EU had been an area of great difficulty for most of
the 90's. The UK had been particularly unhelpful, fearing that any
enhancement of the EU's role would be at the expense of NATO
cohesion. The logjam was broken by the Anglo-French summit at St Malo
in December 1998.  The St Malo Declaration  made it clear that: "the
Union must have the capacity for autonomous action, backed up by
credible military forces, the means to decide to use them, and a
readiness to do so, in order to respond to international crises"  . 
This was a radical change of position for the British and opened the
way to the further developments in 1999 in European defence. The
Cologne European Council Declaration  committed all 15 members in
paragraph 2 </FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">"to further develop more
effective European military capabilities from the basis of existing
national, bi-national and multinational capabilities and to
strengthen our own capabilities for that purpose. This requires the
maintenance of a sustained defence effort, the implementation of the
necessary adaptations and notably the reinforcement of our
capabilities in the field of intelligence, strategic transport,
command and control." </FONT></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	All this work was brought together at the
EU Summit in Helsinki on 10/11 December 1999. The European Council
declaration Annex  spells out the scale, types and readiness of the
forces which are proposed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">To develop European capabilities, Member
States have set themselves the headline goal: by the year 2003,
cooperating together voluntarily, they will be able to deploy rapidly
and then sustain forces capable of the full range of Petersberg tasks
as set out in the Amsterdam Treaty, including the most demanding, in
operations up to corps level (up to 15 brigades or 50,000-60,000
persons). These forces should be militarily self-sustaining with the
necessary command, control and intelligence capabilities, logistics,
other combat support services and additionally, as appropriate, air
and naval elements. Member States should be able to deploy in full at
this level within 60 days, and within this to provide smaller rapid
response elements available and deployable at very high readiness.
They must be able to sustain such a deployment for at least one year.
This will require an additional pool of deployable units (and
supporting elements) at lower readiness to provide replacements for
the initial forces.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Member States have also decided to develop
rapidly collective capability goals in the fields of command and
control, intelligence and strategic transport, areas also identified
by the WEU audit.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">They welcome in this respect decisions
already announced by certain Member States which go in that
direction:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<UL>
   <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">- to develop and coordinate monitoring
   and early warning military means;</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">- to open existing joint national

   <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">- to enhance strategic sea lift

</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	We have now, in theory, an outline plan
for progress in improving European defence capabilities in a way
which works with the grain of NATO. That is a remarkable step forward
given the reluctance of the US and the UK in past years to address
these issues. But there are many difficulties ahead. NATO would claim
to have a planning process, and to have expended much effort over the
years on coercing nations into setting more challenging force goals
for themselves. In practice, the achievement of the process has been
limited, particularly in the past decade. The institutional
arrangements will almost certainly delay the development of the
agreed capability. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT COLOR="#000000">Importance of Air Power</FONT></H4>

<H4><FONT COLOR="#000000">	</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	To this audience, I need hardly preach the
importance of air power. Yet the key change that has happened through
the series of post Cold War crises is a wider political understanding
of the importance of air power capabilities. After the Gulf War, the
UN operation in Somalia reinforced the perception, both in America
and  internationally, that the US was only prepared to remain engaged
if their troops were kept safe. The predominance of air power
solutions to international crises was underlined by the continuing
air operations over both Northern and Southern Iraq. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The sequence of events in Bosnia reinforced
the US view that offensive air power could provide the necessary
coercion to bring recalcitrant leaders to the negotiating table. The
1999 Kosovo air campaign brought together all the political and
military lessons that had been learned in the post Cold War
operations. I do not have to rehearse the statistics about relative
US and European capabilities and contributions to this audience. The
US provided 70% of the total aircraft and 80% of the total weapons
delivered . Europe was shown to be good at providing political
support for the operation, but poorly equipped to contribute to an
offensive air campaign in an effective way. The lesson of what this
meant for influence was not lost on the European political
leadership.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Why is Europe in this parlous state? First
and most obviously is the relative spending on defence. The United
States Defence budget for 1998 was $267 bn  from a GDP of  $8.1 tr.
Out of almost exactly the same total GDP,  the EU nations together
spent some $173bn on defence or 64% of the US total.   The US fields
some 1.4 million professional forces and almost as many ready
reserves. The EU runs 1.8 million troops of which 700,000 are
conscripts and retains 3.6 million reservists at various stages of
readiness. These raw budget and personnel statistics show clearly why
Europe is so far behind the US in its military hardware development.
Europe fields more full time troops, and very many more reservists,
than the United States, yet spends only half as much on defence. It
is spending its money on troops for a defensive war rather than on
air power to meet the new challenges. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	If Europe wishes to be a more equal
partner with the United States in its ability to intervene
internationally, it  needs to spend its defence money differently. It
is currently trying to support far too large a number of regular
forces, conscripts and reserves on too few funds. This means that
little is available for funding research, development and the
procurement of equipment and weapon stocks. While the United States
is scarcely a perfect example of tight control of defence spending,
it is nevertheless achieving a different order of military capability
for its expenditure. This suggests that Europe needs either to raise
its defence spending, or reduce and restructure its forces to match
the current spending more effectively. There are few signs of 
political enthusiasm among nations for raising defence expenditure
significantly, and it is therefore more sensible to look at how
European nations might work together at restructuring their military
forces to provide more appropriate capabilities to the likely demands
of the future.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT COLOR="#000000">Current European Air Power
Capability</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Using the Kosovo  campaign as a benchmark
for a modern military operation which should be within the capability
of European nations, we can break out the scale of effort that might
be needed in future. The campaign needed to be able to call upon the
traditional mix of air defence fighters, bombers, close air support, 
reconnaissance, airborne early warning, air-to-air refuelling,
strategic airlift, tactical fixed wing and rotary transport
capabilities. Although the maritime aspects of the operation were
limited, it must be assumed that some future campaigns might need the
appropriate mix of maritime reconnaissance, air defence, attack and
anti-submarine warfare air assets.  Discussion of Helsinki has
focused on the troop requirements, but it is these air power needs
which will pose the greatest challenges.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The EU nations together have elements of
all of these air power capabilities. They field some 3235 combat
aircraft with a total air force manpower of 380,000. If the NATO
non-EU members are added (Czech Republic, Hungary, Iceland, Norway,
Poland and Turkey) the numbers rise to 4281 combat aircraft and
530,000 men.   These large air power assets are however balanced to
provide the defensive posture that was appropriate to the static
defence requirements of the Cold War. They are also, in many cases,
managed in such small packets as to be infefficient. All  forces have
a strong air defence element reflecting the requirement to defend
their own territory. While many of the fighters can be used in a
bombing role, they are not all weather capable and aircrew will not
have undertaken primary training in this role. For offensive air
operations, the only EU nations with  a significant primary
capability  are France, Germany, Italy and the UK, who can field
around 500 aircraft in an all weather bombing mode. Looking at the
scale of offensive air capability needed for the Gulf and Kosovo,
Europe needs to work at providing perhaps 50% more all weather
bombers than it can at present. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	However, the platform is only part of the
question in modern air campaigns. It has become very clear that in
future operations, precision weapons will be the norm. Figures for
weapons stocks are not readily available, but inferences can be drawn
from the data of weapon usage in the Kosovo air campaign. Only 250 of
the 1011 UK aircraft weapons used were precision  , and for France
the total was 582 laser guided bombs. The French Defence Ministry is
quoted   as saying that they had an inadequate stockpile of such
weapons.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT COLOR="#000000">Approaches to Improving European Defence
Capabilities</FONT></H4>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	In any discussion about improving European
defence capabilities, the argument usually begins with a plea for
more spending on defence. It is also argued that greater integration
of defence industries would be beneficial. Neither approach has much
prospect of early success, and there can be no confidence that either
would generate real enhancements in capability without a  radical
restructuring. Putting aside the political difficulties, Europe could
undoubtedly organise its defence spending more efficiently if it were
done on an integrated basis in the same way that the United States
organises its armed forces at the Federal level. Such an approach for
Europe will not be possible for many years (if ever), as it will
necessary for EU member nations to give up national sovereignty to
what is currently an unacceptable extent. There are similar, although
slightly less acute, difficulties with moves towards allocation of
military tasks to particular nations. This "Role Specialisation" was
much studied during the later stages of the Cold War. Even with a
common view of the mission, nations were reluctant to become reliant
on other Allies for particular capabilities. Nevertheless a de facto
specialisation has occurred as European nations have been unable to
match the technology of the US. It may be that there will be a
greater willingness for each European nation to undertake fewer
roles, but make those that they field more effective. This approach
will require close co-ordination if it is not to open up yet more
gaps in capability.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The proposals agreed at the 1999 Helsinki
Summit could provide an appropriate mechanism for co-ordinating
efforts between EU nations, and also keeping less enthusiastic
contributors up to the mark. It would allow nations to move towards
as much specialisation as they felt comfortable with, and to be
credited with real military contribution to the EU force component.
However this will take some years to develop. In the meantime there
is a danger that European capability will degrade further. What is
needed is some early action to improve capability without assuming
large budget increases. This can only be achieved by looking for ways
to reduce nugatory expenditure by cutting duplication, unnecessary
support overheads, and inappropriate capability. This is a painful
process even when carried out on a national basis. It will be yet
more difficult if it is to be carried out on an EU basis.
Nevertheless, it is the only immediate option available, and can be
done relatively rapidly given the political will. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	If we look at the European forces as a
whole, we see duplication of headquarters, planning, training,
logistics support, procurement, research, bases and other facilities.
This would be bad enough if the scale of the frontline in each nation
justified the scale of the support infrastructure, but it does not in
nearly all cases. Opportunities for more effective operation of
European military forces are apparent in land, sea and air
capabilities. However, the air capabilities offer more easily
achieved improvements for a number of reasons. Air procedures are
already better harmonised between nations than is the case for land
and sea power. This is partly because of air safety issues and partly
because speed of operation means that communications, standard
operating procedures, rules of engagement, planning methods and
terminology must all be agreed, standardised and practised between
air forces which are likely to operate together. English has become
the universal language of the air, and this considerably eases the
problem of mounting international combined air operations. Given the
high unit cost of air force platforms, it is not surprising that many
nations operate common equipment. This also eases the problems of
rationalisation. Finally, the high costs of infrastructure to support
air operations means that modest rationalisation can pay high
dividends in achieving greater military capability at lower
cost.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT COLOR="#000000">Possibilities for Early EU Air Power
Rationalisation </FONT></H4>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	In looking for opportunities to provide
more effective European military power, the leap is too often made
towards a full scale integrated European army. Indeed the Helsinki
proposals are in danger of trying to achieve this step, which remains
impossible unless the EU becomes a much more politically integrated
entity. In the near term (the next 5 years), it would be much more
productive to look for opportunities to rationalise forces in being
which can be operated more efficiently on a multilateral or EU-wide
basis. The model for such a supranational activity is the NATO AWACs
force, which has successfully provided an airborne early warning
capability to NATO members at much lower day-to-day operating cost
than would have been the case if operated on an individual national
basis.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	What capability does Europe need which it
could operate on a similar basis to NATO AWACS? Airlift is an obvious
example. If forces are to be deployed rapidly, they need to be able
to call on a significant airlift capability. The focus on this,
particularly by the German government, and in the Helsinki statement,
is very welcome. However, coordination of assets and multinational
activity is different (and will be less efficient) than integration.
In looking for an opportunity for early rationalisation, we need to
identify a capability which is common to many EU members. The air
tactical transport role is a capability which most nations need, and
many provide for it at least partly using the C130 aircraft. Pooling
of some of these widely used C130 Hercules could provide an immediate
European tactical fixed wing transport  capability. Provided that
nations structured their contributions sensibly, they could make
operating cost savings at the national level through closure of
bases, training units, and headquarters. The level of saving would
depend on the degree to which each nation felt able to rely on the
supporting infrastructure being provided by a European
facility.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	 Some ten EU nations operate C130 aircraft
 . It would be possible to imagine a pooled fleet of 70 aircraft,
which would look after all the national  C130 needs of  Belgium (who
operate 11), Denmark (4), Italy (10), Netherlands (2), Spain (12),
Sweden (8)  and Portugal (6). France with 14  C130s and the UK with
55 have larger  transport aircraft fleets; and they could provide a
partial contribution  of perhaps 6 and 10 aircraft respectively to
the pooled arrangement. Greece (15  C130s) might choose not to depend
on pooled aircraft. For those nations that were prepared to put all
of their C130 fleets into a common pool, there would be significant
savings in operating costs. They would also have a much better
assurance of availability on a day to day basis, given the ability to
plan routine servicing across a larger fleet. For Europe there would
be a usable airlift capability for humanitarian operations as well as
for use within NATO. Nor would nations lose the option to withdraw
their airframes and aircrews if they felt the need for some national
purpose. The force would not be rendered useless if one or more
nations declined to take part in a particular operation for national
reasons. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	However, for lower costs to be achieved
this would have to be quite different from current on-call
multinational arrangements. The force would operate from a single
main base located centrally in Europe, but would have dispersed
flights to service national needs. There would be a single
headquarters, manned by personnel from the contributing EU nations.
Aircrew would be multinational and not tied to the airframes provided
by their nations. There would be a single planning, servicing and
logistics organisation to support the force. Most importantly, the
manpower, headquarters, infrastructure and other savings would have
to be realised in the military structures of the contributing
nations. Those resources could then be redeployed to updating and
enhancing other capabilities. Over time, the management and operation
of this common fleet would lead to a common perception among
participating nations of the characteristics of the next generation
transport aircraft. This would have great benefits in terms of
reducing duplication of defence research and procurement costs in
this particular area. The extra costs of operating on a national
basis rather than a pooled basis would also become clear, and it is
likely that nations would begin to see the advantages of contributing
to such a force element.  This would also increase the pressure for
common equipment procurement programmes for successor
aircraft.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	In a slightly longer timescale, the
requirement for a large strategic airlift capability could be
tackled. The operation of such a fleet could easily be managed by the
same organisation that would look after the tactical C130 pooled
capability. It would be possible to procure a new capability of 
large transport aircraft, which would be in harmony with the A400M
proposals. Costs would be lower than each nation trying to operate a
very small fleet of large and expensive aircraft. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Air to air refuelling capability is also
needed by all European air forces, and would be a natural candidate
for a European fleet operation. There is consideration being given to
procuring the UK air to air refuelling capability through a public
private partnership arrangement. This would be particularly easy to
enlarge to encompass those nations in Europe which sought such a
facility. The economics of the operation would improve for the larger
fleet and there would be no sovereignty issues to worry about given
the service is being provided by the private sector.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	It is possible to draw up similar
proposals for transport helicopters, although care must be taken to
ensure that sufficient assets are based within easy flying range of
their normal tasking. This will tend to require dispersed deployments
and the efficiencies from pooling short range assets will therefore
be less.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Reconnaissance and Combat Search and
Rescue (CSAR) are two roles, which are expensive in equipment and
training, but which could offer opportunities for building up EU
capabilities to operate with the US forces available to NATO. There
will be considerable development in the use of UAVs for the tactical
reconnaissance role, and there is a desire for a European
satellite-based strategic reconnaissance capability. Both of these
capabilities will be expensive, but are essential in the long term if
Europe is serious in its intention to provide autonomous military
capability. The information exploitation organisation will again be
much more cost-effective if operated at the supranational level.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	None of the air transport, air tanker,
reconnaissance or CSAR pooling  proposals would undermine national
capability. Indeed for the smaller nations it would both increase
available capability and reduce costs. It is thus possible to see
opportunities for enhancing the support element of air power in
Europe in a relatively  short timescale through aggressive
rationalisation of forces in being, and exploiting the moves towards
public-private partnerships. Significant defence funds would be
released provided that nations took the consequent manpower and
infrastructure savings which would flow. There would remain a problem
of the "free-rider" nation, although the audit and capability
criteria proposals of the Helsinki Summit may help to stimulate
contributions from EU member nations. At an early stage, it will be
necessary to establish a European Defence Budget to which members
contribute either capability or money.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H4><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#000000">Medium Term European Air Power
Integration</FONT></CENTER></H4>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	While the air support area offers
opportunities for pooling and rationalisation of air power forces
without too many issues of national sovereignty, real increases in
capability will need a similar approach to combat air power. It is
unlikely that major EU defence players will be attracted to giving up
their combat capabilities to a supranational authority until some
confidence has been gained through the less contentious pooling of
air transport and air-to-air refuelling capability. Offensive and
defensive air power capability  is politically the most difficult
element to pool and operate at the European level. Nations are
prepared to make arrangements for multinational forces, but insist on
retaining the ability to operate their forces nationally. The effect
of this approach was seen in the divergence of the national Tornado
enhancements over the past 20 years. The Tri-national training unit
was closed down in 1999 because the aircraft it operated were no
longer representative of each nation's own Tornados. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	 As soon as it became politically
acceptable, some of the existing common combat air equipment
capabilities   could be pooled in a similar manner to that described
for the C130 force. An obvious example would be an EU F16 force.
Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Netherlands and Portugal operate 424 F16s
between them. This could provide some  support for the new deployable
Helsinki agreed force.  Despite the divergence in Tornado IDS
updates, Germany, Italy and the UK could look at how pooled
arrangements might allow them to contribute some of their 570
aircraft to an early offensive capability to the Helsinki force. 
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The introductin into service of
Eurofighter from 2002 to five European nations (UK, Germany, Italy,
Spain and Greece) offers a  unique opportunity to enhance
capabilities and reduce costs through pooling of assets. Sharing
training, engineering, logistic, and operational planning facilities
would throw up significant operating cost savings. These would be
greatly increased as the number of bases required were reduced as a
result. Most importantly common fleet management would play a vital
role in retaining system configuration control so that all
Eurofighters remain fully interoperable. They would be operated as a
common fleet, with mixed crews and a single headquarters. From a
political viewpoint, if as a result Europe were able to offer a force
of 500 of the most modern combat aircraft for future NATO operations,
it would be a capability contributor more equal to the United States
in any Gulf or Kosovo type operation. A pooled fleet would also
ensure that a common approach to weapons procurement was adopted.
Indeed, it would become an attractive club to join: other EU nations
would calculate the additional cost savings to be achieved by
procuring Eurofighter as their successor combat aircraft.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The development of an EU precision attack
capability would be a key part of this medium term plan. The
provision of adequate stocks of appropriate munitions would allow
nations to contribute in other ways than just aircraft and aircrew.
Starting the process early would allow a common view to emerge about
the platform/weapons combination which should be developed. Leaving
France, Germany, Italy and the UK to inependently research their own
future offensive capability will inevitably result in a sub-optimal
solution. A united EU view on both the importance and the nature of
the next generation offensive air power requirement would be a very
powerful driver towards procuring an effective capability. There is
time for this process to begin, provided that nations start to
operate in this role together. Under the current arrangements, Europe
is likely to perpetuate the mix of systems of limited effectiveness
in the offensive role.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	One of the most expensive air power
capabilities is provided by the aircraft carrier. Few European
nations can afford to field such a force; for those which stay in the
role, the opportunity costs are very high. The UK plans to provide 2
carriers in 2012, and it is likely that France, Spain and Italy will
wish to retain the role as well. Operated on a national level, one or
two carriers do not constitute a viable and reliable force, and the
opportunity costs are severe for other defence capabilities. The
timescale is sufficiently long for interested EU nations to look at
how they might jointly contribute to a force of 5 or 6 aircraft
carriers with their supporting ships and aircraft. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Intelligence requirements permeate every
aspect of military operations, and an independent Intelligence
capability will be needed if EU forces are to be able to operate
truly autonomously . Pooling of current intelligence related air
power capabilities will be difficult for a number of reasons. The
equipment used by nations is diverse, and much of it outdated; the
national exploitation is jealously guarded; and there are bilateral
difficulties with wider information sharing. For these reasons, it
would probably be more effective to build up a new EU intelligence
capability from scratch. This would be expensive, but would allow a
fully integrated modern system to be established relatively quickly.
If the EU wanted to focus on one area for priority action, then
Intelligence would provide it. The platforms, communication, fusion,
exploitation and dissemination systems could be built up to be fully
interoperable with NATO, but also independently usable. Kosovo showed
 that the inability to share digital intelligence data was a problem
throughout the operation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	In the much longer term, it is possible to
contemplate the gradual development of the European Air Force as
experience of pooling forces is gained. Confidence would grow with
experience of the greater availability of air power assets to
individual nations, to the EU and to NATO. Such a force would be in
the lead for  a wider integration of European defence capabilities,
which would require the development of a European defence budget. 
Nations would still be able to retain independent national air
capabilities if they so wished, but such national air power would not
count as a contribution in European defence budget terms. </FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	There is a close parallel in these
proposals with the original evolution of independent national air
forces. Armies and navies wanted to own their own air power, and were
concerned about becoming too dependent on an independent air force,
which would be centrally controlled at the higher level. The costs,
confusion and inefficiencies of maintaining army and naval air forces
eventually led nations to form a third service which could procure
and use air power effectively.  The next stage for such sensible
rationalisation must be an integration of air power across national
boundaries. Those national boundaries may have had physical meaning
on the ground and at sea, but are irrelevant in the air of Europe
today. If the political will were there, Europe could produce
effective modern air power, and could even do it more cost
effectively than does the United States.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	This is an exciting and challenging
prospect, where air forces could once again show that they were at
the leading edge of thinking. The prize is a real usable capability
for Europe and for NATO. If we continue as we have for the past
decade, air power will become another specialist activity, which only
the United States can provide.</FONT></P>
