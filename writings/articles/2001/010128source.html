			<h3>An Unexpected Ministerial Shuffle</h3>
			<p>by Sir Timothy Garden</p>
		</div>
		<p>The unexpected departure of Peter Mandelson from the Cabinet this week has immediate implications for UK Foreign and Security Policy. Progress on the Northern Ireland road to peace remains uncertain. Yet the planners in the MOD need to make some assumptions about the future security situation there. The new Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, John Reid, is well known and liked by the military, who have fond memories of his time as a junior defence minister. It is yet to be seen whether the shock of his tough blunt style after caring Mo and political Peter will do the trick in the very difficult  arena of Northern Ireland.</p>
		<p>However, the repercussions of the Mandelson affair are likely to be much more significant in the area of foreign policy. Peter Mandelson was very focused on driving European policy, and pushing the need for the UK to play a stronger role in all aspects of EU affairs. Without him, it may be that the referendum on monetary union has moved even further into the future. Another ministerial enthusiast for Europe, Keith Vaz, is also feeling the fallout of press and parliamentary interest in the Mandelson affair. Even if he survives, his ability to push the European agenda will be much curtailed. If he has to go, then the FCO will be much weakened having also lost Peter Hain in last week&#146;s reshuffle. </p>
		<p>Hain had carved out an independent and important position in the foreign office. To many, he was the centre of the ethical dimension to foreign policy. He sailed close to the wind in terms of ministerial collective responsibility, but enhanced the government&#146;s reputation amongst its supporters. </p>
		<p>With an election looming, the FCO may look very different by the middle of the year. Robin Cook&#146;s position may be a little less vulnerable now that his main competitor, Peter Mandelson, has gone. But there is no shortage of other eager candidates for the job of Foreign Secretary. Geoff Hoon, at MOD, is now being talked about as a safe pair of hands for the job. Whatever happens, officials at the FCO must be despairing about continuity. However they may be consoled that the organisational changes that Hain trailed a fortnight ago are now much less likely.</p>
