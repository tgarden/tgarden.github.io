<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">A decade after the end of the Cold War, the
development of new strategic thinking is beginning to mature. Few
predicted the number and frequency of military operations that would
be undertaken by Western nations after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
The Gulf War of 1991 accustomed our publics to the new form of
warfare. Acting on behalf of the United Nations to preserve
international law, the United States could lead a coalition of
nations to restore Kuwait's sovereignty. That this could be achieved
with so few casualties to the participating armed forces was also a
novelty. A prolonged air campaign with precision weapons became the
new doctrine. Iraq, Bosnia and Kosovo have encouraged this approach
to warfare among the United States and, to a lesser extent, its
European allies. The unsuitability of such tactics to solving
conflicts in Africa has meant that the West has been less willing to
commit forces.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Professor Colin Gray defines the modern
strategy of his title as "the theory and practice of the use , and
threat of use, of organised force for political purposes in the
twentieth century" . He claims that there is a unity to all strategic
experience across history because nothing vital to the nature and
function of war and strategy changes. He rejoices in being a
neoclassical realist who knows that it will always be impossible to
improve the nature, other than temporarily, of world politics. This
profoundly pessimistic view of the future does not make him despair,
as he sees good strategic thinking as essential if things are not to
be even worse. Thus the three major wars of the century (World War I,
World War II and the Cold War) are part of an irregular cycle which
will continue into this new century. Yet there could have been
different, and arguably much less agreeable, outcomes to these major
conflicts. Nor do the astonishing changes in the technology of
warfare cause Gray any problems with continuity of strategy. The
century saw the move from two dimensional warfare on land and sea, to
the exploitation of the air, the ocean and space. Communications
moved from signal flags and the telegraph to virtually instantaneous
broadband digital data relayed by satellites. Nuclear weapons
dominated, and indeed initiated, much of the strategic thinking of
the last 55 years. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Gray brings more than academic theorising to
his arguments. He spent 20 years in the United States, and for part
of that time was a much respected US government advisor dealing with
many of the issues that he covers in this book. He catalogues the
changes in the tools of warfare, and is rightly sceptical of the
advocates of the latest technological silver bullet which provides a
universal winning solution. He seeks to show that two hundred years
ago Karl von Clausewitz's writing on war remains the authoritative
perspective for today. Not everyone will agree. The wider security
concerns of an interdependent world may not respond to the military
levers of the past. In any event, the increasing value put on human
life, including that of its soldiers, by the developed world is
making Clausewitzian strategy more difficult to follow. Gray believes
that strategic performance, either in defence planning or in war,
will be harmed if policy is vague, ephemeral or too constraining upon
military activity.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">It is to the defence planning and policy of
the United Kingdom over the past 20 years that Professor Lawrence
Freedman addresses himself. Clausewitz does not even make it into his
index. Doubtless Gray would point this out as an indication of the
lack of strategic thinking underpinning successive British defence
policy approaches. Freedman's book is not a single developed history,
but rather a collection of related essays which he wrote throughout
the period. While this allows the reader to judge how prescient, or
otherwise, he may have been, it inevitably means that there is some
repetition and less historical perspective than the title might
suggest. Rightly he focuses on the practical politics of British
defence policy through the Thatcher, Major and Blair years, when
resources and commitments have been the overwhelming factors rather
than grand strategy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">While Mrs Thatcher was seen as a strong
defence advocate, she pressed hard on her Ministry of Defence, which
she saw as wasteful and inefficient. She may be remembered for her
strength over the Falkland Islands, but it was her wish for John Nott
to conduct his radical defence review just a few months earlier. John
Major also started his period in office with a war: this time in the
Gulf. Even as the troops were deploying to fight, so the officials in
London were planning the disbandments to follow Tom King's defence
review. This pattern of defence review followed by a new major
military operation continued with the Blair government, who would
claim that Kosovo was exactly the sort of operation that they had in
mind when they conducted the strategic defence review of 1998.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Despite the pragmatic nature of British
defence policy, the operational results have been astonishingly good.
The policy has at various times been all too vague, ephemeral and
constraining upon military activity, yet the strategic performance
has been reasonably effective despite Gray's warnings. Perhaps Kosovo
and East Timor, which are too recent for analysis in either volume,
are the most appropriate pointers to the future. A humanitarian war
stretches the strategic thinking of the past, and inevitably means
great constraints on military action. For Britain, the limitations of
its military power became evident in Kosovo and spurred greater
enthusiasm for making European defence work. As Freedman says: " It
may be premature to suggest that Britain has identified the optimum
force structure required for the emerging strategic
environment".</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">It is fascinating to read the work of two of
Britain leading defence academics, who are writing about events on
which their policy advice has often been sought. Gray's is an
excellent and necessary textbook for the international relations
student, while Freedman's will be an enjoyable read for those more
interested in the machinations of Whitehall. </FONT></P>
