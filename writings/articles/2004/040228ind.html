			<address>From a speech given at Indiana University by the former air marshal and professor of defence studies</address>
			<address>24 February 2004</address>
			<p>Forecasting what the world is going to be like in this new century is an uncertain art. Unfortunately, crises, both natural and manmade, emerge so rapidly that predictions are upset almost as soon as they are made.</p>
			<p>Over the past 3 years, we have all come to know what fanatical terrorists, who care nothing for either their own lives or those of their victims, can do to damage us and our interests. We have fought two wars, first in Afghanistan and next in Iraq. We have seen greater strains in the relationships between the old friends across the Atlantic than for nearly half a century. And we continue to see our troops injured and dying as they try to rebuild nations in the Middle East, Asia, Africa and still in Europe.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;At the heart of our transatlantic debate, is the still unanswered question of how best to meet the new security challenges. There is a fair degree of agreement between the US and Europe on the most important concerns in the wider sense of global security. Despite the tremendous successes of recent years in moving towards more democratic states, there remain parts of the world where either government is not functioning, or where totalitarian regimes still hold sway. At the same time, there is the growing threat from those who owe no allegiance to any state, but operate outside the rule of law, and can use terror as their weapon.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>We face problems of international crime; of corruption which undermines democracy; of poverty in much of the world; of declining natural resources be it fish, oil or fresh water; of environmental damage of which global warming is the most acute; of population growths in poorly governed regions; and of disease returning and spreading through global travel.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Some of these factors make conflict more likely, and all of them need concerted action by the global community. Europe remains less effective when trying to meet the challenges at the hard end of security. These challenges come from undemocratic states developing powerful new weapons, with which they hope to deter intervention by the international community. They also come from extremists who combine a willingness to die for their cause, with a wish to maximise the terror and destruction on their enemies. And, they come from the strife within weak countries, which can lead to mass refugees, who look to the rich nations of the world for help.&nbsp; The US could do more at the softer end of security. Neither approach on its own can make us safer.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The international system is imperfect, but it is important. We need to re-establish the trust between Europe and the US after a very bruising period so that we can work together &#150; old friends and new friends &#150; to make the world a better place.</p>
