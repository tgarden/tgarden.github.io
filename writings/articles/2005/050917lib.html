			<h4><b>Iraq: where now?</b></h4>
			<address><b>&nbsp;</b>The prospects for Iraq are gloomy. Tim Garden argues that we must continue to argue for best policy for its future.</address>

			<p>It becomes increasingly difficult to remain objective about&nbsp; Iraq. The mishandling of British foreign policy over the past 3 years has been without parallel in over half a century. It is worse than Suez in 1956. It is too easy to become angry about the unnecessary deaths, the instability to the region, the continuing good news spin,&nbsp; and the adverse effect on our own long term security. We must remain objective, and look at the situation as it is, if we are to provide sound policy for a way forward. Iraq policy has been a litmus test for Liberal Democrat foreign and defence policy. We have spoken out at every stage of the conflict and chaos. Time and time again, we have proved to be better judges of the best way forward.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Iraq has been causing its people, its neighbours and the rest of the world problems since its birth. Like so many conflict areas, the history of its people, who have suffered betrayal, abuse and murder, shapes the modern day political scene. The international community has a very mixed record in its handling of recent events. After years of covertly supporting the despotic regime of Saddam Hussein, the West turned against the monster that it had created, when he invaded Kuwait in 1990. Now 15 years later, Iraq is still a source of&nbsp; danger&nbsp; to itself, its neighbours and the world beyond.&nbsp; This is a failure of the international system of historic scale.</p>
			<p>For much of the 90s, the international grand strategy was one of containment. With the benefit of hindsight, we now know that this approach worked better than anyone had believed. Not a single chemical, biological or nuclear weapon remained, and the long range missiles were also destroyed. The policy of containment was abandoned by the US Administration in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. Indeed it seems likely that President Bush had come into office with a new agenda for Iraq. What we now know for certain is that the change to an interventionist strategy was mature by early 2002; and a good insight comes from the now infamous Downing Street Memo of 23 July 2002. The head of MI6, always known as 'C', reported that Bush wanted to remove Saddam through military action, justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD. He said that the intelligence reports &quot;were being fixed around the policy&quot;. Geoff Hoon, the Defence Secretary, reported that &quot;spikes of activity&quot; had already begun to put pressure on the regime.&nbsp; Under the Prime Minister's chairmanship, the meeting concluded that they should work on the assumption that the UK would take part in any military action. The die was cast before the involvement of Parliament or Congress. Everything that followed was tactics to support the political strategy to intervene in Iraq and change the regime.</p>
			<p>The Liberal Democrat position was clear, consistent and sound throughout. We saw no cause for a rush to war. The international community, through the United Nations, had to be engaged. We now know that the Bush intended to intervene regardless of what the UN Security Council decided. Early 2003, in the run up to hostilities, was a time when great political courage was shown by Lib Dem politicians. Both the Government and the Conservative opposition supported war, although each had dissidents on the back benches. It is easy to see how a quick war, the discovery of a few chemical shells and a rapid move to democracy in Iraq would have been spun by Bush and Blair to demolish the doubters and justify the illegal intervention retrospectively.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>However Labour and Conservative rebels were insufficient in number to allow us to defeat the Government in the first ever debate before going to war. There has been some media criticism that after the vote, the Liberal Democrats appeared to switch to limited support of the intervention operation. As democrats, we had tried to stop the intervention through parliament. Once the vote was lost, support for our troops, risking their lives, on an operation authorised by Parliament was the only option. At that time, the failures in intelligence were not known. If they had been, the vote might have been different.</p>
			<p>The official war was remarkably brief and the casualties, although in the thousands, were fewer than might have been expected. On 1 May 2003, President Bush declared that the mission was accomplished, unaware that it was only just beginning. The Pentagon failed to hand over the post conflict reconstruction mission to the State Department, and most of the subsequent failings stem from that decision. We called for UN involvement in the development of the fledgling new Iraqi democracy. The Pentagon had little interest in the UN, and failed to protect its representative from the bombers. The tactical failings of the occupying forces are well known. The abuse of power, leading to financial corruption, is now beginning to emerge.</p>
			<p>Three things were needed in 2003, and are necessary today. These are a political path to a representative democracy, a viable economy providing employment for Iraqis, and finally adequate security to enforce the rule of law equally for all citizens. The political path should have been defined rapidly after the intervention, instead it was left until the dying days of the Coalition Provisional Authority over a year later. There has been little time to fashion a constitution. The elections of January this year were one bright spot in a very dark story. Yet once elections were complete, the&nbsp; wrangling over representation in the transitional government was prolonged and acrimonious. This lack of consensus has been replicated in the development of the constitution. The major factions, Kurds, Shias and Sunnis each seek advantage at the expense of the other. Up against the August deadline for agreement, the key issues of the role of Islam, the federal stucture and the division of oil revenue remain problematic. Given the lack of Sunni support for the draft, the plebiscite of mid October is likely to be much more difficult. Sunnis are registering to vote in the referendum so that they can reject it. If it fails, then the whole process, including the election of an interim assembly, will need to be restarted, and&nbsp; democracy will be delayed for at least another year.</p>
			<p>If the political path remains uncertain, then the development of the economy is also in trouble. Data is difficult to come by, as it is in the interests of both Iraqi government and multinational forces to pretend that everything is going well. Reporting is difficult, and already more journalists have died in Iraq than were killed in the whole of the Vietnam War. The UNDP produced a comprehensive survey on living conditions having interviewed more than 20,000 families across the country&nbsp; over a year up to May 2005. They found that only 15% of households had a stable electricity supply, and that this fell to 4% in Baghdad. In rural areas, only 43% had access to safe drinking water; this rose to 66% in urban areas. Malnutrition among children was widespread. The sewage system is reported to have suffered &quot;a reverse development in quality&quot;. The report brings some objective numbers to the poor progress that there has been in making the quality of life of the ordinary Iraqi better. We have been repeatedly calling for regular objective data to be published so that resources can be targeted where they are needed.</p>
			<p>The third major issue is that of providing the necessary security for all Iraqis to live in peace and be treated equally under the rule of law. The situation has not improved over the past year. We know how many of the multinational forces are killed each day, and this gives a coarse indicator of levels of violence. There have been a number of unofficial estimates of civilian casualties, given that neither the US or the UK governments claim to keep records. A Lancet survey used an interview sampling technique which produced a headline figure of 100,000 deaths. But this had a wide range of possible variation. An NGO, iraqbodycount.org, has been tracking media reports, and has produced a much more precise estimate of the minimum number of casualties (covering only those that are reported by at least two reliable confirmed sources). Their estimate of almost 25,000 Iraqi civilian killings and 42,500 wounded in the two years since the intervention started, ties in reasonably well with UNDP data. The report also records how each person died. Here the surprise is that only 9% of killings are attributed to insurgents, while post-invasion criminal violence accounts for 37% of deaths. Criminality is perhaps a greater threat to any emerging democracy than insurgency. The suicide bombers grab the headlines, but for most Iraqis it is the local warlords and armed criminals who threaten their lives.</p>
			<p>There are external pressures on both the US and the UK governments, which shape their actions in the coming months. The US wants to reduce the number of troops for reasons of both cost, but also wants the freedom to act elsewhere. It will however wish to retain some presence in Iraq for the indefinite future. The UK&nbsp; has a need to draw down, particularly given a significant commitment in Afghanistan next year.&nbsp; By the end of this year, when the election of a proper democratic government under a new agreed constitution is due,&nbsp; the economy and civil infrastructure is unlikely to have improved much. The security situation will be no better, given that the political process can do nothing to address the problem of criminality. If the political process is derailed, the insurgency may be much worse.</p>
			<p>The future is therefore bleak, with the most that can be hoped for in the near term being a state not unlike Afghanistan today. A semblance of democracy, with regions operating semi-autonomously, and serious crime continuing may be the best on offer. The Kurdish north will strengthen its independence particularly if it acquires an increasing share of the oil revenues. The Shia south, supported by Iran, will tighten its hold on the people through both religion and repression, but also look to profit from its oil. The central area including Baghdad will continue to be lawless and will lack investment.</p>
			<p>What can we suggest now that the illegal intervention of March 2003, followed by an incompetent occupation, has resulted in such chaos?&nbsp; Of course, the political route to democracy must be encouraged.&nbsp; The infrastructure must be improved, and Iraqis must be employed in the rebuilding of their country. This will require targeted funds, and they in turn require objective data on a regular basis. Security will not be provided by foreign forces. Even if a more thoughtful counter-insurgency strategy were implemented, the widespread criminality and corruption needs curbing by the Iraqis themselves. The presence of the multinational forces over more than two years has not improved the situation. It is time to plan with the Iraqis a phased drawdown over a period of no more than twelve months. This must be accompanied by the resources to help them rebuild the country.</p>
			<p>Finally, what lessons should Lib Dems take from our Iraq experience? First, we are better able than those in Government to weigh the evidence, and make the best judgments. Second, a principled consistent stand gains public respect. Third, we can speak with one voice,&nbsp; when the issues are dividing the other political parties.</p>
