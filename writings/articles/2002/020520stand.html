			<h3>Who's in Charge?</h3>

			<p>Is the posting plot for the now famous Brigadier Roger Lane a serious issue, or just media gossip to fill a lull in the Afghanistan Campaign? The facts have taken a crucial few days to emerge. The Royal Navy is responsible for managing the careers of officers in the Royal Marines, and says that it had planned to post Brigadier Lane earlier this year for career management reasons. There are only a small number of appointments at that senior a level, and they wanted to put in another officer, so that he could have experience of operational command. <br>
				<br>
				The selection for Commandant General of the Royal Marines is one which is important to the whole of the force. To get the best man for the job would mean trying to have a field of more than one officer to choose from. In peacetime, it hardly causes a murmur to see postings cut short, or in some cases extended, to make it possible to have a choice for the top man. This seems to have been the original scheme for Brigadier Lane, when he was due to move early. <br>
				<br>
				Then the Marines, who had been on standby for months, suddenly got the call to undertake potentially very serious combat operations. Again, it would not be unusual for routine posting plans to be turned on their head. The Ministry of Defence says that the decision was taken to extend Brigadier Lane in post for continuity in operational  circumstances. This would have been wise as men are unlikely to be happy seeing their commander disappear home just before the shooting starts. <br>
				<br>
				So far so good. But it is at this point the story begins to become rather more untidy. Unnamed MOD sources are claimed to have been spinning against the Brigadier over the past few days, as criticism of lack of engagement with the enemy appeared in the UK press. This became so serious that the Defence Secretary, Geoff Hoon, felt it necessary to give a very strong statement of support for Brigadier Lane on the Sunday Frost programme. By Monday morning the MOD let it be known that it had always been planned to replace the Brigadier in June. By Monday afternoon, Admiral Sir Michael Boyce, Chief of the Defence Staff, was so exercised by the adverse press comment that he called in the defence correspondents to explain that this was a routine move of a senior officer, and that the changeover might happen as early as mid-June. At the same time the MOD Press Office was claiming that the intention was to keep Brigadier Lane in theatre until the end of operations, and it would not be possible to predict when that might be, although it was hoped to be by the end of June.<br>
				<br>
				Doubtless, much of this muddle has been caused by confused staff work rather than conspiracy, but the effects are potentially serious. The most important need is for unequivocal support from the top down for the Royal Marines in Afghanistan, who are operating in challenging and difficult circumstances. They do not want their commanding officer to be having to fight Whitehall as well as al-Qaeda. They need to know that he has full backing from above. <br>
				<br>
				Geoff Hoon was  absolutely right to give his public endorsement on the Frost Programme. He would also be right to ask the Royal Navy and MOD staff what they are playing at. He appears to have been given no information about the planned move of his key commander, which could possibly take place within a few weeks. Nor apparently was the Chief of the Defence Staff aware of the Navy's plan.  <br>
				<br>
				There are two questions that need to be asked. First, do the Royal Navy believe career management takes precedent over operational effectiveness? Once 45 Commando was sent on what might turn out to be a very hazardous mission, they needed to have continuity of command. Only if their commander proves to be unfit for the job should he be removed, and then immediately. In war, lame ducks are a liability.  The second question is how the PR disaster was allowed to happen. This is not just a question of good or bad spin. We have soldiers on operations and they deserve better. We have a Defence Secretary  and Chief of Defence Staff who need to be told what personnel management games are being played with their operational commanders. <br>
				<br>
				And finally, spare a thought for Brigadier Roger Lane. He will be doing his absolute best to carry out the difficult mission he has been given.  He will be leading, motivating and inspiring his troops. He would probably prefer not to have his career prospects being discussed over the breakfast tables at home. <br>
