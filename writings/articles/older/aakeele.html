<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>My title - What price Defence? - was intended to capture two
topics. The first is the colloquial use of What Price? By which I
mean how do we see the world in the immediate future from a security
perspective - and are the trend lines good or bad for the longer term
future. Where will our security concerns be focused, and what will
the nature of those concerns be? The second is the more literal
translation of the question. If we as a nation believe that our
security concerns require military forces then there will be a bill
attached to those forces. In the past the scale of provision that we
made against the cold war threat gave some assurance that forces
would be available for other contigencies. Though as the Falklands
Conflict showed it could be tight even then. When even the Dean of St
Paul's feels he has to write to the Times seeking a bigger Defence
Budget (19 April 1993), should we be increasing rather than
decreasing? And if that is not realistic, how do we manage within the
resources we can expect?</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Now, with NATO nations cutting their forces, concepts changing,
and defence budgets under great pressure everywhere, how do we make
sure that we can meet the needs of the new world order? </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Strategic Context</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>What sort of a world have we inherited in the aftermath of the
Cold War? From a UK viewpoint, the answer must be that we are
immeasurably safer. This may seem an overstatement when we completed
a major military operation in the Gulf so recently, with signs of new
sabre rattling by Saddam, the papers are full of our troops' exploits
in the Former Yugoslavia, and nuclear concerns about North korea
continue to surface. Despite all this, since the demise of the Warsaw
Pact, followed by that of the Soviet Union, the direct threat to
these islands has all but disappeared. I make no assumptions about
future developments, I am merely looking at those countries with the
military power projection to reach the UK today and judging whether
they could have any conceivable reason for using it against us. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In the longer term, direct threats might re-emerge if NATO
atrophied and Russia grew stronger. In a very particular way we might
come within range of ballistic missiles acquired by more distant
hostile countries, but that is still some way off. It is of course
possible to construct scenarios which would give more short term
concern. A sudden change of direction in Russia and the
externalisation of problems; or the tension between former Soviet
Union republics, and in particular Ukraine and Russia, spilling over
to a more major conflict in which perhaps the decaying nuclear armory
was used. But in all of these the old Cold War expectation of a war
across the whole of Central Europe is no longer valid. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Even so war in Europe is not just possible, but is actually
happening. One price of the end of the Cold War has been the growth
of local conflicts: old scores to be settled, ethnic and racial
disputes, economic tensions, and sheer brigandry. The disintegration
of  the former Yugoslavia has been the most visible, but  within the
former Soviet Union there has been, and increasingly will be,
flashpoints for conflict. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Before I leave Europe on a whistle stop world tour, what about
Western Europe? Can we assume that disputes will continue to be at
the level of fish and lamb wars among Community Members? We certainly
do make such an assumption for our defence planning, and I believe
rightly. However, the defence relationships between the members are
not without their tensions, and I shall return to this when
considering the international responses shortly.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Let me move on round the globe. In the Gulf War, the scale of
forces provided, and the number of nations providing, showed that the
Middle East remains an area of great strategic importance. Again
there are no lack of scenarios for new difficulties in that region.
Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait -
you can almost perm any two to produce worries for the future.
Internal tensions are also great in some parts of the region, with
the possibility for severe changes to the balance of power. The
oilfields will ensure that the future of the region is of interest to
the West. As we have seen, Iraq continues to be able to stimulate a
military response from the West. Yet at the same time we have seen an
amazing change in the Israel/ Palestine question.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Moving further East, the Indian subcontinent continues to flare up
with both internal unrest and external border disputes. Interest in
China as a player on the International scene seems to have waned. Yet
the indications are that in the not so long term, it could be a very
significant player on the world scene. Its economic growth continues
unabated. Next time you are in a department store, have a look at the
electric toasters - lots of familiar brand names, but all with Made
in China as country of origin. An economically successful China, with
a massive army and nuclear weapons will presumably be an influence on
strategic thinking in the future. Already we see it beginning to flex
its control of the local seas. As power projection capability
increases, we may have to take more notice.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>While in the Orient, the future impact of Japan's position on the
international scene is also important. It may continue to be broadly
neutral in terms of European security interests. There are of course
other directions both positive and negative, which given its economic
strength may affect our future world.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Korea continues to be an area of concern. North Korea has been
working hard to gain weapons of mass destruction, and despite the
current progress, could become a flashpoint once again. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Moving South, let me wring my hands over Africa first. The four
horsemen of the apocalypse seem to have decided that Africa is a
great place to stay. The famine, disease and war are all
inter-related. The West response is primarily humanitarian in its
most limited sense. Yet there are also great signs of hope. I have
just returned from 4 weeks in Southern Africa. First in Botswana
where a stable democracy has been running successfully for 17 years.
Then to Namibia where the old SWAPO guerrillas have a happy
relationship with the white settlers, and the government has been
running successfully for 4 years and joined the Commonwealth. South
Africa has again confounded the pessimists, and the spirit of
reconciliation is real. Mozambique is holding elections now and
Frelimo and Renamo working together. Yet there is still the problems
of Angola and Rwanda.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>South America has made a great move to democracy in recent years
with a move away from military dictatorships, and regaining control
of economies. There and in Central America, the Drug trade is an
important security factor for the future. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Before completing the rapid spin round the Globe, let me just
hover for a moment over North America.  Developments in security
policy in the United States affect our security interests very
directly. Europe continues to benefit greatly from the US
contribution to its defence needs.It benefits not just through NATO,
but also through the provision of the expensive parts of armed forces
for operations elsewhere. Some on both sides of the Atlantic would
argue that this is not healthy for Europe, and in any event is not a
safe long term planning assumption. Certainly Europe's actions today
will influence the US approach to European security in the future.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>And so we return to the United Kingdom. An island of tranquillity
in a turbulent world? Well we have had Northern Ireland absorbing our
security concerns until the recent ceasefire. This gives the best
hope of progress that we have seen in a generation. It would however
be a brave man who thought the problems will be solved easily.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>International Responses</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Let me now move my analysis on to what sort of International
response we may expect to all these uncertainties and concerns.
Remembering of course that we must expect the conflict that we
haven't predicted to be even more difficult. I will start with NATO:
partly because we need to look at how it is reacting to the new game;
but most importantly because it is the only working military
coalition that we have. NATO is at a watershed. The unarguable
rationale of the Soviet threat has gone away. Member nations are
looking to cream off their peace dividends by reducing forces
significantly. Some would hope for a decrease in US influence. Others
are concerned that NATO has the wrong forces, with the wrong
organisation to meet the new challenges. Are they right? Should we
care about the future of NATO? I think we should care, and that means
we do need to adapt NATO in a way which keeps the organisation
meaningful - and most importantly a usable military force. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>NATO has of course been responding to the changes in the
international scene. At the higher levels a great deal of work has
gone on to reduce the headquarters structure.  The three top level
Allied Commands Atlantic, Channel &amp; Europe are reducing to two.
The lower levels of command are rationalising and reducing. There
will still be a somewhat unwieldy organisation, but this is the price
you pay for keeping 16 Nations happy - and it compares pretty
favourably with the EC bureaucracy. At the same time the forces are
being regrouped. With no European wide threat to deter, the accent is
on smaller, but more reactive, regular forces to meet the
unpredictable flare up, and the capability for more major defence put
into storage, but in a way that it can be dusted off when needed. 
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>There are those who argue for faster change, and even a move away
from NATO, sometimes on the grounds that its days are numbered. This
seems to me to high a risk. The WEU, the CSCE, the NACC and the UN
all have important diplomatic roles to play in security issues. Only
NATO has the military infrastructure, training, forces and procedures
to deploy efficient and usable international armed forces. That said
I would not underrate the strains that the organisation is under in
responding to the new world order and the different perspectives from
either side of the Atlantic and within Europe.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The other major player is of course the United Nations. I say " of
course ", but we do have to make a judgement as to whether the trend
for intervention by the UN will continue and whether the intensity of
such intervention will also increase. I recall suggesting at a NATO
conference five years' ago that we might find ourselves more involved
in UN sponsored operations as the security council recovered from its
cold war born paralysis. The suggestion fell on stony ground. But if
the UN is to take on the world policeman role, it will need a better
handle on the nuts and bolts of military planning. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The role of Europe as an entity in future security work is still
emerging. The questions are various: the implications of Maastricht
on the road to a common security and defence policy; the role of the
WEU; the part that the eastern European states and the neutrals have
to play, and under what umbrella organisation - but time stops me
from going too far down that fascinating avenue.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>UK Position</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>What I need to turn to now is the more narrow question of the
impact that all this may have on the UK's security policy, and hence
defence policy and the provision of military forces. We shall
doubtless discuss whether Britain does more than its fair share on
the world's stage given its economic status. Nor is it for me as a
military officer to comment on such a foreign policy issue. However,
I do have to be concerned about what the Government may wish to use
its forces for in the future, to ensure that we have provided
resources in the right areas. We have a history of playing in the big
league -and while some deplore it and others applaud - the military
planner needs to take a view on whether we will continue as before. 
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Only two nations are simultaneously members of NATO, the WEU, the
EC, the CSCE and are permanent members of the UN security council:
France and UK. They are also nuclear weapon states and both have
distant interests as legacies of empire. Of those two only the UK is
a full member of the NATO integrated military structure. I make no
judgement as to whether all this is a good thing or not; the
historians among you will enjoy explaining how we could have done it
differently. The fact is that we find ourselves with a leading role
in any and all the organisations that might be expected to do
something about the new world order. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>And of course, it is more than just membership of these august
bodies. We act as an important link to the United States where the
European clubs exclude them. We find ourselves advocating strong
democratic positions in the UN, which carry with them obligations to
follow through. If NATO is the only working multinational military
organisation, its rapidly deployable forces will come into the
spotlight for the more tricky UN operations. Who leads that rapidly
deployable force - the UK. It would therefore seem a bit odd if the
lead nation was not contributing anything but the headquarters to run
other nation's soldiers. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>So we can expect to be asked to make contributions to UN
operations. We also have to maintain a contribution to NATO if we
wish to keep it in being. These are not necessarily separate forces -
but we do need to make sure than we cover the differing tasks. We
also need to retain forces for our direct national interests. These
would include those for the direct protection of our land, sea and
air sovreignty; but also for those tasks that we have to do on our
own. Northern Ireland has been the most obvious and the most
demanding in recent times. Again these tasks are not exclusive. The
troops that patrol the streets of Belfast are sustained by other
battalions based in the UK and in Germany and they can be parcelled
out against the NATO or UN contingencies. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>But there is a new problem. In the Cold War period, we planned for
World War 3. A war characterised by taking all the forces in being -
all other tasks were of lower priority - and using them once to
continue the battle until finished. In the immediate aftermath of the
collapse of the Soviet threat, we began to think of ways to exploit
the lengthening warning times that we perceived for a re-emerging
threat from the East. This system worked fine for the Gulf, which I
can perhaps characterise as a mini WW3: massive forces, high
intensity but short duration. The signs are that it may not have been
typical. UN operations in the traditional Peacekeeping  role have
been small forces of very high calibre, low intensity but prolonged
for years. The former Yugoslavia gives an indication of another model
if the UN moves to Peacemaking: medium scale forces; operating at
high intensity in terms of equipment utilisation and technology, but
not in terms of fighting; and importantly for greatly extended
periods.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The reason I focus on this issue is that it has great relevance to
the cost of forces for the new world order. We have an example of
prolonged armed peacekeeping in Northern Ireland. In a regular army
it seems reasonable that the 6 month intensive tours of duty for
soldiers on the ground should not come round too frequently
(particularly if when they are not in NI they are liable for a Gulf,
a Bosnia or whatever). Even it were to be every other 6 months, you
more than double the number of troops you need (remembering that you
have also to train them for NI and their other role). The aim at
present - not realised for all - is to make the interval between
emergency tours 24 months and that generates a multiplier of 5 for
your forces. If you now transfer this analysis to a UN operation
which errs on the side of Peacemaking and has an indefinite life,
parallel concerns arise. For a given size of force, you can send a
large number of troops for a limited period -or a much smaller number
for an indefinite period. Similar concerns affect planning for air
and naval forces, although the training for changes in theatre is
less of a problem.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Future  British defence policy</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>These then are the factors we have to juggle when planning for the
future. Some pundits argue that what we need is a Defence Review. I
never know quite what they intend by that. The classic Review is
normally a way of making the best of a major cutting exercise. Yet I
sense that cuts in defence are not at the forefront of the thinking
of these advocates for a Defence Review.  What they are seeking is a
matching of capability to commitments in the new world order. Such a
process is of course what we spend our time doing as part of the
defence programme planning process. We do not however start with a
clean sheet of paper each year. Major changes in balance of
capability take time to introduce - faster when cutting admittedly.
We are right in the middle of the changes which the Defence Options
announced - they will be complete around the end of 1995. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The question is whether those forces will be appropriate to the
tasks that we will be giving them.  Where they are not, can we adjust
the allocation of resources or the commitments? Last year's Defence
White paper brought to an eager public a new way of categorising our
defence commitments. It did not change those commitments, but it
helped the analysis of the defence programme. We now talk about three
defence roles. The first is the inescapable need to provide for the
protection and security of the UK and its dependent territories even
when there is no major external threat; the second is to insure
against the emergence of a major external threat to ourselves and our
allies; and the third is to contribute to our wider security
interests through the maintenance of international peace and
security. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Of course there is a degree of overlap between those roles, and
certainly the forces we provide for one are available for another.
But inevitably choices have to be made about what are the driving
factors for size of forces, types of equipment and availability for
more than one task. So at this stage, I can start answering the
literal question of what price the new world order.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>For that first defence role - our inescapable obligations we will
provide forces to protect our land, sea and airspace. Not enormous
numbers, but enough to prevent infringement of sovreignty, piracy, or
other illegal acts all at short notice. We also have national
overseas obligations which are set to continue to decline, but are
still there. The price of these special to UK tasks is not small, and
explains why our percentage of GDP on defence is above the NATO
average.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>For the other two defence roles, NATO and our wider security
interests, we have traditionally scaled our forces on the NATO
ticket, and taken the forces for our wider security interests as a
free good. As NATO and UN actions begin to overlap and to become more
similar in nature, this approach can continue to work. Those forces
that we need for a major NATO conflict should be associated with
longer warning times, and can thus be put at lower readiness, become
more dependent on Reserves, or mothballed. The fire brigade forces -
the rapid reaction elements will be at high readiness for either a
NATO or other operation.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In looking at the third defence role ( pursuit of our wider
interests), my earlier analysis suggests that, like it or not, the
Government will want some reasonable cards with which to play its
hand. Here it is worth remembering that each military capability can
offer a different type of contribution - and at different costs.
Naval Power has great advantages in allowing us to contribute, either
alone or as part of a multinational force, without needing friendly
powers nearby. Forces can be used for monitoring, embargo ops,
intelligence gathering or deterrence. All this can be done without
deep involvement - a naval force can poise for weeks and then if the
situation changes, it can disentangle and sail away. It also has use
for disengaging ground forces if that is necessary.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>If we run up a scale of increasing  political commitment, air
forces offer a form of escalation. No fly zones are now common
concepts for a somewhat hotter diplomatic situation than embargos.
Here we use fighters and airborne early warning aircraft to police
the zone. Again we can de-escalate relatively easily, but we need
support somewhere reasonably local if the cost of air to air
refueling is not to become prohibitive. Another notch up the ladder
comes from the threat to use offensive airpower. The threat to bomb
Serbian targets as a coercive measure  The threat remains in our
maintenance of Harriers to protect the Kurds in Northern Iraq and
Tornados to protect the Shias in the south. Deployments to deter
troop movements.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Finally we come to the real crunch, commitment of troops on the
ground. Whether it is  security for humanitarian aid, traditional UN
peacekeeping, peacemaking or forcible return to the status quo ante
(as in the Gulf), troops on the ground are a different order of
magnitude in commitment. They are time consuming to get in and get
set up, they are more difficult to operate on a multinational command
and control basis, and they are ten times more difficult to withdraw.
For all those reasons, it is a real sign of a Government's
seriousness of purpose when the decision to put them in is taken. For
most operations, ground troops will be needed at some stage.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>On current plans the UK defence forces are structured pretty well
to offer these choices to the Government. What they cannot do is
produce large scale ground forces on operations for indefinite
periods,at least while they also have Northern Ireland. Options took
the savings from the short notice massive single shot fighting war
capability, but left the breadth of capabilities to offer a 
selection of military capabilities for the future. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>This approach seems to have worked well. There is of course a
great temptation to assume that whatever operation we are currently
engaged in, that is the model for the future; and that we should
therefore optimise our forces accordingly. Thus the Gulf War was seen
by some as the indicator for much greater investment in air
superiority and precision offensive air assets at the expense of
ground and naval forces. Others were quick to use it as the
justification for an expansion in tanks. Humanitarian operations for
the Kurds have given air transport, both fixed wing and helicopters,
a boost. Multinational embargo operations in the Adriatic remind us
of how useful our surface fleet can be in bringing diplomatic
pressure to bear. UN operations in Bosnia show that the experience in
Northern Ireland pays dividends in UN ground force operations.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I could go on. My message is that we have a range of military
capabilities that allow the UK to choose its response to an
international problem in a very selective way. There are alternative
models. We could draw in our horns and abandon the rest of the world,
but we would still spend a sizable amount on our inescapable national
security tasks. We could maintain our current level of resources but
concentrate on one capability at the expense of others. We might then
find that we had nothing usable to offer for the next crisis. Or we
could provide more resources to give more endurance to our
capabilities.  </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Inevitably, what we will actually do is more fuzzy than these
stark alternatives suggest. We will focus our near term resource
allocation on those areas where we can see deficiencies, while trying
to keep our longer term plans as adaptable as possible. We will see
where we can draw our horns in and use the resources released to
improve in more urgent areas. We could of course spend more money on
Defence if the Government decided that it wished to have more
choices. On the other hand, we would need some fairly dramatic
changes in our foreign and security policy if we wished to spend much
less. The reduction in direct threat to the UK has also allowed a
more relaxed approach to using commercial resources for the base
support of forces. Some of these cost reductions have contributed to
the latest Front Line First exercise.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Conclusion</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>So how do we answer the two questions implicit in my title? What
price Defence? The international scene is more complicated, wars in
which we have an interest seem set to happen more often. Wars in
which our nation is threatened look less likely. The international
security structure will continue to evolve, and we will need to make
sure that we do not throw away the old before the new is ready to
take on the role. In this respect there will be a price to pay for
the continued good health of NATO, and probably another to give the
UN a better military HQ capability. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>For British Defence, there is little scope for further reductions
if we wish to remain an influence in the transition to the new world
order. Even if we decided to look inwards exclusively to our national
concerns, the price would be significant, and the reductions in
expenditure limited. The broad mix of capabilities that we deploy
allow us to choose our level of involvement with some care; and thus
to have a significant say in the collective international response.
We cannot afford to be the world's policeman - nor would it be
appropriate. However, we  can play a real part both diplomatically
and militarily.</P>
