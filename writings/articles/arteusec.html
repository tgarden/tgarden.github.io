Coming Decade and Their Priority</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><I>A Paper for The Ukraine &amp; European Security
Workshop held at Odessa 22-25 November 1996</I></CENTER></P>

<P>Europe has historically been a source of both instability and
conflict. The two most destructive prolonged and geographically
extended wars of this Century began in the centre of Europe. The
post-War peace in Europe was bought only at the price of the
continuous threat of a possible third even more destructive war. Many
of the causes of friction between peoples in Europe were not
addressed during the period of stasis in the Cold War, when Europe
was divided between the two superpower adversaries. There were
however two major changes in Western Europe during this period: the
development of what is now the European Union; and the interstate
co-operation for security through NATO.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>By the end of the Cold War, part of Western Europe had made
considerable progress, along a route of economic interdependence,
towards making armed conflict unthinkable between fellow members of
the European Union. While the Common Market had not been formed as a
security organisation, the development of common economic interests,
with a system of rules and laws common to member nations, has led to
an entity, within which war has been relegated to the near
impossible. This process continues as the EU develops, and as it
looks at its scope for a common European security identity. In
parallel, the success of NATO since its foundation has been not just
in its role as a collective security alliance, but also as a
mechanism for building confidence between members and preventing
conflicts between members.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>There have been, and there are, other organisations which have an
impact on European security, but the contribution that the EU and
NATO have made to the elimination of conflict between member states
is of a different order. For this reason, when looking to European
security issues of the future, it is these two organisation which are
the starting point. Future security predictions can only be made in
the context of assumptions about the way in which both NATO and the
EU are likely to develop. In this analysis, we consider the likely
future security problems for Europe, the currently available means to
reduce the risks associated with the problems, and then consider
whether any new approaches are needed.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><CENTER><B>Future Security Concerns</B></CENTER></P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>Vital Interests</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>There are a number of current and future security concerns for
Europe. All States have a concept that they define as their vital
national interest. This will certainly include the survival of the
State itself, but will also include the preservation of its
territorial integrity and the defence of its airspace and surrounding
waters. A threat to a vital national interest is one that must be
countered with the highest priority. The potential for war between
NATO and the Warsaw Pact represented a threat to each nation's vital
interests, and therefore considerable resources were devoted to
providing the wherewithal to reduce the risk of that conflict.
European states will continue to examine whether there is any
potential external threat to their individual vital interests. The
mechanism for defining a European collective vital interest is not
yet properly developed, but this might be expected to emerge in the
coming years. Many in Western Europe will take the view that there is
no such threat at present, but that there may be future potential
problems. The future of Russia will be a major factor in this
analysis. While Russia now has neither the capability (with the
exception of nuclear forces) or inclination to pose a direct threat
to Western European nations, it is still of concern to its nearer
neighbours, and could remilitarise to pose a wider threat in the
future under certain circumstances. The future of China is also a
factor in the longer term. Some other countries, which are
potentially hostile to western liberal democracies, may be developing
a strategic delivery capability, which could provide the threat of
attack using weapons of mass destruction.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Russia is not the only possible source of concern for territorial
integrity. Pressures of population and economic need, particularly
from the North African states, may lead to mass migration northwards
to European States. This is a different form of invasion from the use
of armed forces, but is a potential source of conflict.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Territorial disputes remain, and are likely to become more intense
as environmental pressures increase. Water, fishing and minerals can
all lead to conflict. The geography of Europe offers many
opportunities for experts in international law to earn their money in
boundary disputes. In particular Turkey and Greece have shown
continuing hostility over territorial limits around the many islands
in their neighbouring coasts. There is also the continuing problem
over the partition of Cyprus.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Ethnic disputes are not new to Europe, but the growing acceptance
by the international community of a philosophy of ethnic
self-determination is a potential cause for much new disputation. The
experience gained in the break up of Yugoslavia has shown that the
strength of feeling among ethnic groups can still lead to conflict
which cannot be ignored by neighbouring states. If this presages a
development towards more of Europe's ethnic groups seeking
realignment of national boundaries, and fragmentation of states,
there will be no lack of potential causes for conflict. Such bids for
ethnic self-determination can be a threat to the survival of the
state. However as the division of Czechoslovakia has shown, it is
possible for states to divide without conflict.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>Wider Security Interests</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The definition of Europe is not an easy matter. The geographer may
be able to find convenient natural features to mark the boundaries,
but these are not necessarily aligned to the political, historical
and cultural definitions of Europe. This is not merely a question of
academic definition. Europe can define itself in terms of a list of
States, but those States bring with them a more extended set of their
own wider security interests. The future of Israel, the occupied
territories and the neighbouring Middle Eastern countries affects
Europe both through proximity and through economic links with the
region. Likewise the oil states of the Middle East, although more
distant, are key players in the economic health of Europe and their
stability must be a security concern.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In the longer term, European states also need to consider the
changing power balance on a global scale, and whether it can affect
European security. The emergence of China as an economic and military
superpower might have profound implications, but they are not yet
clear. The ASEAN countries will provide both economic competition and
opportunities, but are not likely to figure in direct security
concerns for a long time. Sub-Saharan Africa is an area where
instability and conflict remain alarmingly prevalent. Europe will
have concerns for this region for both humanitarian and historical
reasons, but there is unlikely to be a direct security issue arising.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>A key security issue that is directly relevant to Europe's
interests is the future relationship with the United States. For the
post-War period, Western Europe has depended greatly on the direct
involvement of the United States in its security. That involvement
has been guaranteed through NATO. With the demise of the Soviet
Union, the United States has taken on the role of world policeman,
even if it has at times been reluctant to do so. As economic
competition becomes greater, the world seems to be forming into three
competing regions: NAFTA, EU and ASEAN. If this regionalisation of
economic competition leads to trade wars, then it is likely that the
United States will be less willing to provide costly support for
European security. This will have a direct affect on the security of
European states.</P>

<P><B>Internal National Security Concerns</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In addition to the vital interests of European states, there will
continue to be a range of national security concerns to be taken into
account. They will be different for each nation, and even when they
overlap, they may be accorded different priorities. For example, in
the UK terrorism stemming from the Northern Ireland problem remains a
major national security concern. Spain has a terrorist problem as
well, and all states can be at risk from both internal and external
terrorist activity.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The counter-terrorist requirements can absorb a considerable
proportion of a nation's defence resources. In Northern Ireland, a
fifth of the British Army are in place at any given time, and the
need for roulement of troops involves all of the army. In this
respect a national terrorism problem can have an indirect effect on a
nation's ability to contribute to wider European security. For the
future, there are concerns within the international community that
extremist terrorist organisations may gain access to chemical,
biological or nuclear weapons which would have profound implications
on security.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The worldwide drug trade is a security issue, which is not a
directly military threat. It carries with both corruption and
criminality cultures, which can be difficult to eradicate. They can
lead to a breakdown in the rule of law, and put at risk democratic
government. In all these policing fields there are significant long
term national security problems for an increasing number of nations.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Intelligence operations did not cease with the end of the Cold
War. With the dependence on technological developments for economic
success, some states and companies will use espionage techniques
which have security implications. In particular, the massive increase
in the use of networked computer systems for data storage has opened
up new vulnerabilities. As economies become even more dependent on
computer systems, states will need to pay attention to potential
information system threats.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><CENTER><B>Managing the Military Capability</B></CENTER></P>

<P><B>NATO</B></P>

<P>In looking at the relative importance of the plethora of potential
future security issues, we must next consider the organisations
available to manage any problems, and their likely development in the
future. For a direct military threat to the sovereignty of Western
European nations, NATO has provided a strong collective security
guarantee for four decades. Since the end of the Cold War, it has
been clear that NATO needed to evolve if it was to continue to be
useful in providing added security. The direct threat of the Soviet
Union had gone, and a number of the Central and Eastern European
nations were looking to come under the NATO security umbrella as
insurance against any emerging future Russian threat. Most see the
Partnership for Peace programme as a step on the way to full
membership.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>At the same time, NATO enlargement carries with it a number of
problems. Decision making on a consensus basis had not always been
easy between the 16 members, even with a single view of the security
threat. Any increase in membership, at a time of more diffuse
purpose, would compound this difficulty. In addition most European
nations are in the process of significantly reducing the resources
devoted to defence. Any new members of NATO would therefore be
welcomed only if they could participate on an equal footing. There
seemed little enthusiasm among the current NATO members for
increasing their defence obligations in order to provide protection
for new members. A diluted NATO, coupled with a lack of obvious
threat, might lead to the demise of the organisation. For many
however, the major problem is how to manage any expansion of NATO
without risking a return to a confrontational and divided Europe.
Expanding NATO would be a cause for concern to the nations which were
not brought into the collective security arrangement. In particular
Russia could feel threatened by its former adversary expanding and
coming closer.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>This gives us a difficult problem when examining the future
security of Europe. The only military organisation in being now,
which can provide multinational forces to defend European interests,
is NATO. If it remains at 16, it will fail to recognise the entirely
reasonable aspirations of its neighbours. If it expands piecemeal, it
risks instability from those states outside of the organisation. At
worst it risks stimulating a new division in Europe, and hence
reducing security. If it expands too quickly, it may not be able to
keep the organisation together. Indeed, it may be that, without a
direct threat and with continuing force reductions, NATO is set to
atrophy under most possible futures. The future of NATO is therefore
a key consideration in future European security. Without it, the
United States is less likely to be a positive security influence for
Europe. Without it, individual states will do little in a military
security context apart from their internal security requirements,
unless another organisation takes on the burden. Without it, the
Central and Eastern European nations will find a power vacuum in
which they must find new accommodation with Russia.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>WEU</B></P>

<P>In looking for future arrangements for European security, the
Western European Union must also be taken into account. The WEU was
reinvigorated at the end of the Cold War, and was seen by some as a
potential vehicle for the development of a European military
organisation which could act as the agent of a European foreign and
security policy. Experience in the Gulf War and in the Former
Republic of Yugoslavia has highlighted the limitations of the WEU.
When it tries to act separately from NATO, duplication of effort and
confusion can be the result. As a result of these experiences, the
WEU has adjusted its approach to become a much more useful
organisation. Given that full membership of the WEU currently
requires states to be members of both NATO and the EU, it can act
very usefully in involving its observers, associate members, and
associate partners in matters of common security interest without
having to choose which states should be given full membership. This
is helpful.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The WEU has also made considerable progress in its relationship
with NATO. It is now able to complement NATO activities rather than
duplicate them. The question for the future will be to whether and to
what extent the WEU will grow to become a more equal partner with
NATO. The current arrangements depend on the provision of a number of
US assets for any WEU operation. While this may be practical for
small operations, it is difficult to find a scenario in which there
would be a major operation without the US, but at the same time US
involvement through the use of NATO common assets under WEU auspices.
If the WEU is to develop into a European security arm, it will need
to be able to field its own intelligence systems, its own sea and
airlift, and its own command and control assets. It is a long way
from this today, and the developing cosy relationship with NATO makes
it less likely to change in the near future.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>Emerging European Military Relationships</B></P>

<P>In any consideration of how the European States will meet future
security challenges, the possibility of multilateral arrangements
must not be forgotten. The various developments such as the initially
Franco-German Eurocorps or the Anglo-French Air Group suggest that
there are possible co-operative arrangements possible between States
which can take place within the NATO and WEU framework. In earlier
times, there was much debate about NATO nations specialising in
particular roles. It was possible to conceive of West Germany
providing the bulk of the ground forces, the UK and the Netherlands
providing a strong naval arm for NATO, and the US acting as the main
air power agent for NATO. Such proposals never made much headway
because the major nations all wished to retain a broad spread of
military capability. With the draw down in military spending, the
retention of balanced forces is probably no longer an option for any
European countries. The pressure for such specialisation,
rationalisation or sharing of roles will therefore become more acute.
Unfortunately, at the same time as the financial incentive becomes
greater, the lack of a single perception of the need for the forces
makes it more difficult. If there were a common European foreign and
security policy, which each EU member was totally committed to, such
sharing of tasks would be a natural consequence. It may come
eventually, but it will require much time and political development
of the EU. This is likely to be slowed by the process of EU
expansion. In the mean time the development of bottom-up co-operative
ventures between member states will assist in providing more
effective forces, and should therefore be encouraged.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The future is thus uncertain as regards the organisations which
will manage the military capability for Europe. NATO cannot stand
still, but may atrophy as it tries to adjust to the new requirements.
The WEU is so dependent on NATO for its capabilities that it has
little hope of emerging as the military arm of the EU. The
establishment of a European Army (using the expression to capture the
concept of a balanced capability drawn from EU members) will have to
await a more unified Europe. This may take a long time. A major
security concern for Europe is therefore the maintenance of a useful
military capability and the necessary organisation to operate that
capability.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><CENTER><B>Managing the Political Institutions </B></CENTER></P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>European Union</B></P>

<P>If the future of the military organisations relevant to the
security of Europe is uncertain, so too is the future of the European
Union. A successful EU enhances security for its members through a
number of mechanisms. Members are unlikely to resort to conflict to
solve disputes between themselves as their economic futures are so
interdependent. Economic success also increases the resources
available for defending against external threats. The key question
for the future is whether this happy state of affairs will continue,
and whether the Maastricht Treaty aim for a Common Foreign and
Security Policy can be translated into a concrete organisation, which
will lead to the emergence of true European defence. This at present
seems unlikely in the short to medium term.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>A successful EU can also have security implications with respect
to those who are not members. Already, the free market within the EU
is making the economies of the North African states more difficult to
manage. The division between rich and poor nations may worsen, and
this can lead to economic migration problems or even conflict. Even
for prospective members of the EU, the austerity measures which may
be necessary to meet membership criteria can lead to internal unrest.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Many of the same nations which are looking for NATO membership are
also seeking EU membership. It appears that the NATO membership
question is likely to be addressed first, with a US led initiative
for announcement by 1999. This is in some respects unfortunate.
Membership of the EU will be recognition of a thriving democratic
market economy with common interests with the current members. This
is a sound basis on which to build a joint security arrangement.
Indeed, it could be argued that EU membership is now the better
security guarantee, given the common interests of its members. The
presumption that NATO enlargement will happen first suggests that the
criteria for NATO membership are somewhat easier to meet than those
for the EU. Indeed the fact that Turkey, a long standing NATO member,
is still waiting for EU membership reinforces this. Yet for NATO to
thrive, it will need members with sound economies, democratic
governments and common security interests.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The EU has a number of problems for the future which will affect
the whole of Europe. The progress towards a common economic zone in
Europe has been impressive. Yet different members have very different
approaches to what they see as the long term role of the EU. There
are those nations who seem to want no more than a convenient free
trade area, and the UK is often seen as an advocate of this position.
There are those who are characterised as advocates of a new
federation of Europe. Enlargement will bring strains if poorer
agricultural states are to be integrated, and will require major
changes to the common agricultural policy. The move towards a common
currency is fraught with difficulties. If the stringent economic
criteria for membership of this common currency are not applied,
there will be significant financial instability and a lack of harmony
between members. If they are applied, some states will need to take
painful domestic measures to achieve membership, and others will be
unable to join. The EU has weathered such storms before, and will
doubtless do so again. Nevertheless, the future membership and their
relation with one another is by no means certain.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The road to a common foreign and security policy is also
uncertain. France and Britain are the two members with a history, a
culture and a capability which allows them to look at the wider
international security scene. Other EU states have been less
interested in taking an active role beyond their borders. Germany is
perhaps in the process of making the transition to becoming a more
active participant. Yet it is as yet difficult to envisage the EU
defining European vital interests in the same way that the USA can
define and protect its national interests. Certainly, it will be
necessary for the EU to make this step if it is to act as a military
power on its own.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>OSCE</B></P>

<P>On the face of it, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation
in Europe should be able to contribute to future security on the
continent. It has focused on conflict prevention and has the widest
membership of all the European institutions. It does not have a
military arm and while it has been a useful forum for security
discussion, it has not shown itself to be able to secure peace in the
most difficult European areas. It may grow in stature and be better
able to provide early warning of potential conflict within Europe,
and authority for the necessary operations to prevent that conflict
taking place. It has therefore a unique role, but one which currently
should not be overstated. It shows little potential for changing in a
way significant enough to affect future European security more than
it does at present.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>UN</B></P>

<P>In this round up of the implications for security of the future of
the key European institutions and organisations, the United Nations
must also be considered. Since future European security concerns are
likely to be global in nature, and to include threats from
non-European states, the United Nations will remain an important
element in conflict prevention, crisis management and peace
enforcement. The involvement of European nations in UN operations has
an effect on the capability, experience and utility of their armed
forces. In recent times, significant military contributions have been
made by European nations to UN operations in the Gulf and in Bosnia,
as well as to humanitarian and peacekeeping operations around the
world.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>An active and well supported UN can improve the prospects for
European security, but it also requires the resources both in money
and in military capability to underpin such a world policeman role.
Recent UN operations have shown that the organisation is not well
structured for the running of complex military operations. It is at
its best when in can produce an agreed strategic aim and subcontract
the necessary military operation to nations with the necessary
expertise, either under a NATO umbrella or as a coalition of nations
(with one taking the leadership role).</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><CENTER><B>Reducing Risks</B></CENTER></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>This paper has looked at the interaction between the organisations
and institutions of Europe with the potential causes for future
insecurity. In order to deduce the priority issues for the future, we
must next consider the scope for reducing the risks of conflict. In
the Cold war, arms control and confidence building was seen as the
path to risk reduction. The inspection and verification regime which
has resulted from that period continues to provide reassurance
between states but is less important given the other links that have
developed through Partnership for Peace, and bi-lateral arrangements.
However in terms of continuing to reassure Russia about NATO
intentions, and to reassure Russia's neighbours about its own
intentions, the inspection regime still has benefits.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Arms control also has a continuing role to play in the nuclear
field. Although there has been a very significant draw down in
nuclear capability, there are still large residual weapon holdings.
Continuing the process of reduction, and, most importantly,
controlling access to nuclear weapons must be an area for continuous
attention. Nuclear proliferation is a source of potential danger to
Europe, and transfer of weapons is an easier path to a nuclear
capability than building from scratch. However there is also the
danger of more nations looking to gain their own nuclear weapon
production capability. Europe should work actively at preventing the
export of relevant technologies.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Conflict prevention methods need to be developed. It is clear that
countries are often unwilling to act until events have become so
catastrophic that they are forced to do something. Many of the
conflicts in which Europe has found itself involved might have been
avoided if preventative action were taken at an early enough stage.
This is often difficult, particularly if there is a lack of agreement
by the international community as to the appropriate action. However,
there is a need for better mechanisms to identify emerging problems
and produce rapid response. In military terms this translates as the
requirement for good intelligence and rapidly deployable forces. The
question remains at what level these capabilities are best organised.
There are calls for the UN to take on a more reactive role in world
policing. This would require some form of standing forces for the UN,
which could be sent when required to restore peace. There is little
enthusiasm for the provision of such forces among the main likely
providers. NATO is in the process of adjusting its forces to a more
reactive posture, and the advent of Combined Joint Task Force HQs
should make such operations run more smoothly. Yet NATO cannot
operate without political direction. It can be used as an agent of
the UN, or of its 16 member nations, or perhaps through the WEU as an
agent of the EU.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><CENTER><B>The Priorities</B></CENTER></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>We have identified a range of possible threats to European
security, and a range of possible organisations to deal with these
threats. In order to deduce proposals for action in priority order,
it is necessary to estimate both the risk associated with each
threat, and the potential danger that a given threat represents. For
example, there may only be a very low risk of a terrorist group
acquiring a nuclear weapon capability, but the severity of the danger
associated with such a threat means that nations will be prepared to
give a high priority to countermeasures. On the other hand, there is
a high probability of continuing civil unrest and war in Central
Africa, but the danger to European states from such instability is
minimal; and the prospects for coherent action are correspondingly
low.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>Weapons of Mass Destruction</B></P>

<P>The greatest danger to the future of European states would be from
an attack by weapons of mass destruction. A large scale attack could
at present be mounted by either China or Russia, but in each case
appears very unlikely. The retention of some US, French and British
nuclear forces acts as some assurance that such a possibility could
be deterred. In the longer term, security can be further enhanced by
the reduction of weapons on all sides through arms control.. A
relatively limited missile attack by a hostile rogue state could also
be devastating. While such an action is perhaps also relatively
unlikely, the risks of such an occurrence are multiplied by the
number of potential hostile states. Countermeasures must include
strict controls on enabling technology, arms control verification
measures, conventional pre-emptive action, and nuclear deterrence.
There are those who will argue that this threat is so great that it
merits investment in ballistic missile defences. This is unlikely to
be a common European perception, given the cost and the low
probability that effective defences could be fielded.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>To some, the most likely risk of attack by weapons of mass
destruction will come from future terrorists. They argue that both
biological and chemical weapons are relatively easy to make, and are
particularly effective as terror weapons. Nuclear weapons are
significantly more difficult to manufacture, but may be obtainable
from third party suppliers. Even a conventional explosive device
which used radioactive material as a contaminant would have a
powerful terror effect on populations. In the terrorist case,
deterrence is much more difficult to achieve. Control of materials
and technology for biological, chemical or nuclear weapons must be
achieved on an international basis. Intelligence, from all quarters,
must be pooled.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>Major Conventional War</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>For the present Europe sees little risk of becoming embroiled in a
major conventional war. None of the European states show signs of
seriously wishing to used armed force to settle disputes between
them. Possible differences, which could lead to armed conflict, exist
between Greece and Turkey, between various players around the Former
Republic of Yugoslavia, and in some of the regions of Russia. But
none of them, carry great risk of growing into a major conflict
provided that the international community, led by the United States,
continues to act as mediator. To maintain this ability to mediate
requires involving the United States in the future of European
security, and this is most effectively done through NATO.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>One factor, which affects the degree of risk associated with
bilateral disputes growing into a major European war, is the security
guarantee associated with NATO membership. If membership of NATO
continues to obligate all members to treat an attack on one as an
attack on all, the question of enlargement is a key to any risk
assessment for the future. Too early enlargement could carry with it
the danger of a confrontation on a grander scale. There are many
possible examples; and accession by the Baltic republics is perhaps
the most difficult at present.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>To minimise the risk of a future major conventional war in Europe,
the future of NATO is the key. Present members need to work actively
to keep the organisation healthy, and to ensure that their military
capability does not fade away. They will need to take great care in
the handling of expansion to ensure that they do not take make the
continent less rather than more secure. At the same time the
international community, and in particular the EU, needs to
contribute to the development of strong economies throughout Europe
and especially to the East including Russia.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>Wars outside Europe</B></P>

<P>Europe has shown limited interest in the promotion of its
interests in the wider world by military means, and does not have a
common perception of particular threats at present. The Gulf war was
an interesting model for European participation in distant military
operations. Nations contributed in various ways ranging from
financial support through to full combat capabilities. Given the
disparate natures of European states, future operations are unlikely
to be any more coherent.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The threat of long range attack on Europe by conventional missiles
from distant states is an unlikely scenario, but worries some as
missile technology proliferates. Possible major wars between North
and South Korea or between India and Pakistan are unlikely to
stimulate a single European response, and would not directly affect
European security. Somewhat closer to Europe, an Arab/Israeli
conflict could cause great difficulty. The Europeans might find
themselves at variance with the United States in terms of supporting
the different actors. However, such a conflict would not put European
security directly at risk. Closer still, the break up of the Former
Republic of Yugoslavia and the war in Chechnya have shown that fierce
fighting is still possible nearby. However such problems, while very
bad in humanitarian terms, do not directly undermine European
security and shown no signs of growing into something more
widespread.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>There seems therefore no great risk of widespread conventional war
affecting European security in the coming decade. A thriving NATO
would ensure that what risk there was could be countered.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>Terrorism</B></P>

<P>Terrorism remains a constant threat to the security of European
citizens. That terrorism may be internal, as in the case of ETA or
IRA, or external as in the case of the various factions spawned from
Iran, Iraq and the Middle East. They may be seeking to promote
political, religious, ethnic causes or even animal rights. They can
be very small in number and difficult for the state to penetrate
effectively. There is however no sign that terrorism represents a
threat to European security in the wider sense. It is containable
through normal security and intelligence methods. It would however be
an area where European co-operation could be developed,</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>Criminality</B></P>

<P>It is possible that a greater risk to European security comes from
the breakdown of the rule of law rather than from the classic
military threat. The international nature of illegal drugs
distribution, coupled with extraordinarily large amounts of money,
has led to corruption and criminality becoming more widespread. An
absence of enforceable contract law in some formerly communist states
has also led to criminal protection systems, and associated Mafia
style organisations. If the rule of law is threatened in Europe, this
would be extremely serious for the future of democracy. Moving back
from a corrupt public service to a fair governmental system is very
difficult.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>There are no simple solutions to the problem of international
criminal organisations. Co-operative police work, an independent
judiciary, and accountable public service are all necessary. These
need to be part of the criteria for membership of the EU, and states
need to be actively helped.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>Environmental Problems</B></P>

<P>In the timescale of a decade, it is perhaps unlikely that
environmental degradation will assume the significance of a risk to
European security. However, in the longer term there are a number of
risks, which need to be addressed within the next few years.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><CENTER><B>An Agenda for European Security </B></CENTER></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Any analysis of future policy is bound to be flawed by unexpected
events. It has been said that the dangers that we predict will not
come to pass, because action is taken as a result of the predictions.
The corollary to this proposition is that it is more often the wars
that were not predicted which happen. However, World War 2 and the
break up of Yugoslavia are two examples of predicted conflicts which
were not prevented. The levels of uncertainty about all the different
aspects of European security over the next decade make predictions
even more difficult. Nevertheless, there are certain common threads
which have emerged from the analysis above.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Firstly, despite the local instabilities, the large residue of
nuclear weaponry, the economic chaos in parts, and international
terrorism, European security prospects are better than at any time in
the past 60 or more years. There are two strong organisations, the EU
and NATO, which can provide the basis for an enlarged security area
with stable and successful democratic economies. The first priority
must therefore be the preservation, development and controlled
enlargement of these two entities in a way which improves the
security of current members and brings benefits to a larger part of
the continent. The United States has a continuing role to play in
promoting stability, and bringing pressure to bear on difficult
problems. It would be difficult for the other international groupings
to replace the close security relationship between the US and Europe
that NATO engenders.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The continuing relevance of NATO will not be easy to manage.
However, the considerable success of the Partnership for Peace
programme is an encouraging sign. Despite the reluctance of current
and prospective members to adopt a half-way house to full membership,
this may become effectively what happens. The current talk of an
expansion by three or at most four members followed by a very long
pause is not realistic. It is in the interests of Europe to bring
more states into a closer relationship with NATO. The PfP programme
can be a vehicle for this. The real danger to NATO in the future is
that as it enlarges, its members will continue disarming to a state
where it is no longer a viable military alliance.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Jointly with the promotion of NATO must be the continuing
development and enlargement of the EU. While this will also not be
easy, it can be done in more measured manner. The current members
need to support the prospective members in resources and in
expertise. It is in the common interest to have a larger and thriving
free market area. Managing relationships outside of the EU area will
be of especial importance. A trade war with North America would
hardly help in the security relationship with the United States.
Similarly, tariff barriers which impoverish the North African
littoral will lead to new economic migration problems. The
development of a common foreign and security policy is a reasonable
aim for the EU, but it will not be easy. The key to success will be
to allow the mechanisms to emerge. Forcing the pace is unlikely to be
successful in this area, and risks dividing members. While NATO
thrives, the EU can manage with its rather ad hoc approach to
security affairs.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>If the development of the EU and NATO are the first priority
issues for European security over the next decade, there are a number
of secondary, but important other priorities. These will include
active promotion of the other international organisations, and in
particular the United Nations. One question that may need to be
addressed in the period is the question of how Europe speaks in the
Security Council. It may be that it will not continue to be seen as
satisfactory to have France and Britain as the permanent spokesmen on
Europe's behalf. The UN needs to be supported as the agent for
enforcing the rule of International Law. In this respect European
states need to be prepared to contribute both money and military
manpower when necessary. This merely re-emphasises the importance of
NATO both as vehicle for structuring military contributions, but also
as a way of training for multinational operations.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Terrorism, Criminality and Environmental issues form the third
tier of security priorities. They are not third because they are
unimportant, but either because they can be managed in a number of
ways or there is time to develop new techniques. To counter the
terrorist threat to security, both European and international
organisations need to continue to build on the co-operative ventures
which already exist. Exchange of expertise and intelligence will also
have benefits in wider security co-operation issues. Countering the
illegal drug trade and international crime requires international
police co-operation. Indeed for many of the potential problems of the
future, the police are as important as armed forces. The UN needs to
look more to police resources. For environmental security risks, the
nations need to co-operate in research and prevention. The EU has a
role to play in this as does the UN.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><CENTER><B>Conclusion</B></CENTER></P>

<P>Europe faces uncertainties, but no clear major risks to its
security in the next decade, provided that it can manage the
transition of the former Soviet Union into a collection of partner
states. This it can best do through the evolution of the European
Union and NATO. Both will need to help Central and Eastern European
nations including Russia with both economic and security
improvements. At the same time, it will remain important to keep the
United States closely involved. There is an unusual opportunity for
enhancing European security at the same time as enhancing economic
prospects. It does however require the Western European nations to be
generous in their help to the rest of Europe.</P>
