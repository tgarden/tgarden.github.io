<ADDRESS><CENTER>RAFA Dinner 23 February 1996</CENTER></ADDRESS>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>First can I thank you for the very kind invitation to join you for
this very pleasant evening. I decided that this must be the mark of
old age when one is asked to come and speak not about the Royal Air
Force today, or the Future of Air Power - my more usual topics, but
to share my flying experiences on the Vulcan. I am not sure how well
qualified I am to do this. The Vulcan  arrived into RAF service on 20
July 1956 having started as a revolutionary paper proposal by Avro to
the Ministry of Supply in May 1947. It is interesting to compare the
time from concept to delivery then (all 3 V bombers were achieved in
an 11 year period), with today's much longer procurement timescales
despite all the technological advantages of the late 20th century.
But from my point of view there is little I can say about that early
period of the Vulcan as I was more interested in my primary school
activities. Nor did I join the RAF with the V-force in mind.  The
aircraft that excited me as a boy was the Lightning: it seemed almost
to be one man sitting on his own personal rocket. In the event, I
spent my early career on Canberras in Germany and subsequently as a
flying instructor. Never did the V-force come into my circle of
activities, and by the mid 70's it seemed pretty well a closed shop.
I had a tour after the army staff college as the Personal Staff
Officer to the AMP. This was a sort of private secretary job. It was
high risk/high reward in the modern parlance. If you made mistakes
you moved pretty fast, but if you kept your boss out of trouble the
reward was a good posting. Happily my mistakes were well enough
covered up for me to be asked by my boss: ACM Sir John Gingell (who
later went on to be Black Rod) what I, (at that stage a 34 year old
squadron leader) would like to do next. When I made some noises about
enjoying the flying training role, he made it quite clear that one
tour as an instructor was a necessary part of your cv, but more would
definitely be inhibiting. He wanted to know what operational aircraft
appealed. To which I replied that I was happy with any provided it
could be turned upside down ( hoping thereby to keep away from
maritime, transport or helicopters). He nodded and said he would sort
something out. A few weeks later he called me in to tell me where I
was going: You will be taking 50 Squadron he said. It is difficult to
remember a time now when the RAF had so many squadrons that  a
serving officer might forget which aircraft type they were operating.
Having thanked him profusely, I made a hasty retreat to check my list
of squadrons and discover that I was going to have the privilege of
taking over a Vulcan squadron some 23 years into its service life,
with the expectation that it would be pensioned off shortly after the
end of my two year tour.  My thoughts therefore are of what were
expected to be the final days of the Vulcan.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>As I said earlier virtually everyone on the V-force was by that
stage an old hand. People would go away to do a ground tour or
perhaps a spell as a flying instructor and then return to the force.
So when I arrived in March 1979 at Scampton to start the operational
conversion course, I discovered that most of my fellow students were
returning to do the course for yet another time. On the first morning
of ground school, we were programmed to go out to the airfield and
look round the inside of an aircraft on the line. The instructor said
he thought he could safely miss this out given we were all so
experienced. I caused some consternation by explaining that despite
being a wing commander, and OC 50 Sqn designate, I had never seen the
inside of a Vulcan.  The trip was laid on, and I have to say it was a
mixed blessing. Like most people who have not been inside the
aircraft, the extent of its reverse Tardis construction - bigger on
the outside than on the inside - is not apparent. To climb up into
the tiny cockpit which was to be home for two years was an
uncomfortable initial experience. Fortunately co-pilots were
invariably lithe young officers who did not overlap the captain's
space.</P>

<P>Looking at my log book I see that we spent from mid March to early
June on the ground school. The nuclear aspect meant that every system
had to be understood, and that there were no easy squadron commander
exam papers. The flying conversion was just 12 sorties over a period
of a month.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>And so at the beginning of July I found myself at RAF Waddington,
a station that I had never been to before, in a quite different
culture. The V-force was quite different. Despite the transfer of the
deterrent baton to the Polaris force, it was clear that the ethos of
an elite had been maintained. The aircraft with a crew of five having
to work as a team - and an unchanging team at that - trained to use
weapons of such awful power - gave rise to a seriousness of purpose
that was different from the normal professionalism that one finds
throughout the RAF. Looking back on the various interesting postings
that I have had, I still believe that running a nuclear bomber
squadron with no previous experience on the aircraft was one of the
most challenging. The safety procedures were rightly so strict that
there were no short cuts for the squadron boss. I had my own crew,
with its own target allocations and associated training requirements.
Most of our routine training sorties would last about 4 hours and
would include a high level (40,000 ft) leg followed by a let down to
low level at 250 ft perhaps to fly around part of the United Kingdom
low level link routes, and finish at a bombing range before returning
for some emergency drills, and general flying practice. It was a
delight to fly, amazingly responsive on the controls and always
enormous reserves of power.  Occasionally my smaller aircraft
background would worry my crew. I remember on an early sortie, my
very mature AEO who  had seen it all, squeaked when I said " standby
for emergency rate descent - presumably we roll and pull through like
every other aircraft.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The technical capability of the aircraft was, and still in
retrospect remains, impressive. The computing power may be primitive
and was predominantly analogue rather than digital. But it used
valves and not solid state devices, which turned out to have an
unexpected bonus in EMP days. We had a terrain following radar and of
course the extra computing power of five brains. To practise
prolonged low level at night we would deploy to Goose Bay in Labrador
where we kept a permanent detachment of engineers. Here you could fly
for 3 hours and the only lights that you would see would be the
airfield lights on take off and landing. Sometimes you would see
little because you were also doing the low level flight in cloud as
well. That had its problems. The observant among you will notice that
I use spectacles. I had developed slight short sightedness during my
time as a staff officer, and so this was my first tour in which I
wore corrective flying spectacles. Normally this was no problem, but
on a long low level night sortie with nothing to look out at but
cloud, I found it more comfortable to fly on the instruments without
glasses. Recovering to Goose Bay after just such a trip, we started
our approach on radar, and were aware that the weather was somewhat
marginal, and the thought of another two hours en route to the
nearest diversion, rather than a beer and bed was not attractive. We
broke cloud at around 200 feet and I looked up for the runway lights,
at that stage remembering I ought to put my specs on. They were of
course down in the bottom of a flying suit pocket. After a somewhat
snaking approach, my AEO said he was adding a new check to the
airfield joining check list:Captain put your glasses on!</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Goose Bay had other attractions such as the wonderful Arctic char
and salmon. In the -30 temperatures, there was no difficulty in
freezing it, and it could be transported back in numerous cavities in
the airframe known to every crew chief. On one occasion we had not
only our own requirements but supplies for a mess function. The
frozen fish were safely stowed and of course remained happily frozen
as we crossed the Atlantic at high altitude. We let down to
waddington at about 11pm, the airfield was clearly visible from
overhead, but the atc were reporting visibility of less than 100
metres at ground level. We circled round waiting for clearance to
make an approach and just after midnight were at minimum fuel for
diversion. So we diverted to Lossiemouth in the north of Scotland.
Landing there after 2 in the morning our first priority was to find a
large freezer! One of the fish was not found until 3 weeks later by
which time the aircraft was the least popular on the fleet.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>We used to spend a fair amount of time crossing the Atlantic as we
also maintained a detachment at the USAF base at Offut in Nebraska.
This was a popular detachment both for the flying and the shopping
opportunities. The 21,000lb bomb bay allowed one to return with
bicycles, lawn mowers and the choicest selection from the K-Mart. The
Americans remained impressed by the Vulcan to the very end. Although,
there ignorance of it was sometimes breathtaking. I took an aircraft
to display at the Cleveland Ohio air show. The display was at the
lakeside airport which had a runway on the short side of short for a
Vulcan. We arrived with minimum landing fuel and streamed the
breaking parachute (something one always tried to avoid when away
from home as it was a bugger to repack. We parked up and decided to
leave the chute until the next day when we were fresher. On a
pleasant sunny morning the crew all tried to help the crew chief get
the parachute back in its stowage. An early visitor to the show came
up and pointed to the hatch with the trailing chute and asked me if I
was the one who jumped out of there! After a number of attempts the
chute was stowed but the MI showing that it was operating doggedly
refused to turn black. The AEO assured me that this was a fault in
the indicator. We took off the next day like a rocket, low on fuel
and high on adrenaline, and aimed straight for Wright Paterson with
its wonderful long runway and fuel supplies. The AEO reminded me that
we were unlikely to need the chute on this landing. We were off again
to Goose Bay; again the warning not to use the chute; and so back to
Waddington and I said just for my own satisfaction I would stream the
chute on landing. I touched down, a little aerodynamic breaking, and
pressed the button: No comforting retardation, but a heap of
parachute on the runway waiting for collection.  </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>On exercises we would as often play the bad guys as playing the
good guys. With our range and high low capability we would often be
called to simulate Russian bombers, sometimes we would be accompanied
by other aircraft simulating stand off missiles for us. We had one
such deployment to Northern Norway for a major exercise, and enjoyed
using our 4 aircraft day and night for a couple of weeks as Warsaw
Pact bombers. I thought however that we might do our little bit to
confuse the Russian Intelligence organisation for our final trip
home. I am sure many of you will remember the impressive Vulcan
scrambles when four aircraft on QRA would have to be in the air
within 4 minutes of the warning. It was technically a little more
difficult at a small Norwegian airfield, but we managed to do a 4
ship scramble in 2.30 min. I still wonder whether the Russians wasted
years on analysing this new British posture of scrambles from Norway.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>We were of course continually tested by evaluators and I have said
little about this. Our world revolved around staying current in all
the aspects of our nuclear task. Most had I think forgotten that we
had a theoretical conventional weapon capability. Certainly no one
was interested in keeping us in practice for it. I remember on one
occasion visiting the armoury at Waddington and being surprised to
find a team whose job it was to keep the 1000lb bomb carriers
serviceable. The Falklands were to  show how you should never throw
anything away. I handed over my squadron in middle of 1981, and
apologised to my successor that he was coming for a short tour to
wind up the squadron. Neither he nor I realised that he would get a
longer tour than anyone, which would include the first use of the
Vulcan in anger, and that in the conventional bombing role, and then
the change to the tanking role briefly. But you will need to invite
him to tell that story.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Perhaps I could finish with just a few words on the RAF today. The
story of the Vulcan is by no means exceptional in terms of an
aircraft procured for one job (high level strategic nuclear bomber),
operated in another (low level tactical as well as strategic nuclear
bomber), and used in anger in yet a third (medium level conventional
bomber). The inventory we have today, and many of those due to come
into service, were conceived during the Cold War when we envisaged
the dreadful possibility of an all-out war across Europe. Today we
find the airforce still policing Iraq from the air, acting in UN
embargo operations and involved initially in peacekeeping in FRY and
now in the IFOR operations. The aircraft are adapted to these new
roles, and the crews respond incredibly. We are not without
difficulties, the RAF is much smaller and still shrinking, yet more
people are detached than ever and we have had every aircraft type
carrying out operational tasks over the past year.</P>
