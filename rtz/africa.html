<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P>RTZ-CRA's operations in Africa account for
5 per cent of assets, 9 per cent of net attributable earnings, and
employ around 9,000. Principal operations are: the Palabora copper
mine (39 per cent) and the Richards Bay Minerals (50 per cent)
titanium dioxide feedstock producer, in South Africa, Rossing Uranium
(68 per cent) in Namibia, and Rio Tinto Zimbabwe (56 per cent). There
is currently exploration in a number of sub Saharan countries.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><H2>Palabora (38.9 per cent)</H2>

<P>Palabora Mining Company, which is managed by RTZ-CRA, operates a
large low grade open pit copper mine, smelter and refinery in the
north east Transvaal. The deposit was identified in the early 1950s
and a joint venture company was formed in 1956 to develop the mine.
Palabora is a listed South African company and one of the Republic's
largest copper producers. The mine started up in 1964 and accounts
for 75 per cent of South African primary copper product sales.
Palabora's total sales represent 2.4 per cent of South Africa's total
mineral output.</P>

<P>Reserves are sufficient to continue open pit production until
2002. Thereafter a new undergound mine will extend the life of the
mine by at least 20 vears. Ore reserves below the existing open pit
will be worked and the material processed through the existing
metallurgical plant. Planned annual production is 90,000 tonnes of
copper.</P>

<P>About half the refined copper is made into continuous cast rod for
sale to South African fabricators, with the remainder exported as
cathodes. Excess production above fixed contracts is sold on the spot
market.</P>

<P>The by-products from the copper process include zirconium
chemicals, uranium oxide, magnetite and nickel sulphate, as well as
small quantities of gold, silver and platinum. In addition, sulphuric
acid is produced as a by- product from the smelter. The company also
owns an adjacent vermiculite deposit which is mined and concentrated
for sale worldwide.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Pioneering mining techniquesfrom Australia and sophisticated
Canadian smelting technology are the basis of Richards Bay Minerals,
formed in 1976 to mine, process and market the heavy minerals which
occur in the sand dunes of the Zululand coast. RTZ-CRA has a 50 per
cent interest with South African interests owning the remainder.</P>

<P>RBM is located north of Durban in Natal. The company mines heavy
minerals from the dunes by suction dredges floating on artificial
ponds. Gravity, magnetic and electrostatic processes are used to
extract the economic components of ilmenite, zircon, rutile and
monazite. The latter three products are sold in their natural form
and the ilmenite is upgraded and smelted to produce an 85 per cent
titanium dioxide feedstock and pig iron.</P>

<P>Titanium dioxide feedstock is RBM's major product. It is a non
toxic compound with hundreds of uses in dailv life and an essential
raw material for the production of white pigment used worldwide in
the manufacture of paints, plastics and papers.</P>

<P>The ilmenite at Richards Bay has a low alkali content, which makes
the product suitable for the more environmentally acceptable chloride
process of producing titanium dioxide pigment.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><H2>R&ouml;ssing Uranium (68 per cent)</H2>

<P>RTZ-CRA manages Rossing Uranium, an open pit uranium mine and
processing plant in the Namib Desert, Namibia. The mine started
production in 1976 and is one of the world's most efficient open pit
uranium mines.</P>

<P>Uranium ore is extracted from the open pit and processed on site
into uranium oxide. The uranium oxide is exported for use solely by
electricity generating utilities worldwide. The sales contracts are
subject to rigorous national and international safeguards</P>

<P>The mine and plant were designed to produce 5,000 short tons of
uranium oxide per annum. However, the depressed uranium market made a
significant contraction of operations necessary in 1991 and annual
output is now some 2,300 tonnes of uranium
oxide(U<FONT SIZE=1>3</FONT>O<FONT SIZE=1>8</FONT>). The work force
is now about 1,300 people. Despite these reductions it is estimated
that Rossing still accounts for about 7 per cent of Namibia's GDP, 12
per cent of exports and 4 per cent of total tax revenue.</P>

<P>Rio Tinto Zimbabwe is mainly involved in gold mining at Renco,
Patchway and Brompton mines, waste dump retreatment at Eiffel Flats,
and in nickel refining. Renco, which opened in 1982, is Zimbabwe's
largest single gold mine and Rio Tinto Zimbabwe accounts for some 15
per cent of the country's arnual gold production. Empress Nickel toll
refines for customers.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
