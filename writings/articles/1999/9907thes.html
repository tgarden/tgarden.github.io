<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The bombing of Kosovo and the arrest of
General Pinochet may turn out to be the defining events for a
different international scene in the 21st Century. Or they may turn
out to be interesting footnotes to a future thesis on the concept of
ethical foreign policy.  Geoffrey Robertson QC, the international
human rights lawyer, has no doubt that, after centuries of injustice,
we are at the dawn of a new age.  He feels no need to agonise over
the implications of humanitarian intervention, and rejoices in the
end of the protection afforded by the traditional international
respect for sovereignty. "Crimes against Humanity"  was originally
planned for publication a year ago to celebrate the decision taken by
120 nations in Rome to set up the International Criminal Court. This
tentative step towards making despots accountable for their crimes
was certainly an important step forward for the international
community, but since then Pinochet and Kosovo have translated the
theory into practice. That Robertson has managed to seamlessly weave
these new issues into the text of his lengthy volume is impressive.

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The book takes a sweeping historical look at
the development of the concept of human rights. He acknowledges the
legacy of religion and ancient civilisations. Both Greece and Rome
gave rights to their citizens, and religious doctrines held certain
behaviour universally wrong. Magna Carta enacted rights to a fair
hearing more than 700 years before  the European Convention on Human
Rights was to do the same. In the 17th Century, many of our modern
concepts of rights were formulated in England with the Bill of
Rights. Revolutions, which at least in theory were about the rights
of the people, spread through Europe and America. The abolition of
slavery started in England in 1807, and completed in Oman in 1970, is
an acknowledgement by all nations of a universal human right to
freedom. Yet in all these, and many other examples, of the evolution
of human rights, it was up to each sovereign state to provide the
necessary law and to police the rights of its citizens.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	At the close of the 19th Century, there is
evidence that the idea of  intervention operations for humanitarian
reasons was beginning to take root. The Royal Navy had been
liberating slaves from ships around the African coast for some time.
Britain had provided forces to protect an ethnic minority of
Christians from killing by the Turks in Bulgaria. America justified
its declaration of war on Spain in 1898 on the grounds of the
oppressive rule in Cuba which "shocked the moral sense of the people
of the United States". And all of this was without CNN.  Roosevelt's
1904 State of the Union message made it clear that the US believed
intervention for humanitarian reasons was justifiable when 
oppression was on a vast scale.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The horrors of the Great War may have had
a restraining effect on looking for new reasons for military action.
Certainly, neither the Versailles  Peace Conference  nor the League
of Nations Charter were formulated with the promotion of human rights
as a key factor. The prevention of another war was seen as the most
important  aim, and that reinforced the idea of the importance of the
sovereignty of states. Wars happened when one state interfered in the
internal affairs of another. Robertson credits H.G.Wells as the real
father of the modern thinking on human rights. In 1939, Wells had
advocated the adoption of a Declaration of Rights which would be "the
fundamental law for mankind throughout the world". With a small group
of leading English socialists, he constructed a simple list of
principles which recognised that all people were entitled to a set of
common rights. By 1942, his principles had become such a part of the
democratic thinking that the Allied powers announced  the
preservation of human rights as a war aim. The growing realisation of
the terrible outrages against the Jewish people by the Nazis ensured
that human rights  remained on the agenda after the war. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Two events changed the whole approach to
international law. The first  was the setting up of War Crimes
Tribunals in Germany and in Japan.  Churchill had favoured the
summary execution of the Nazi leaders, but  Truman, Stalin and de
Gaulle wanted an international tribunal to judge them.  Robertson
argues that this was a key moment in history.  While Nuremberg was a
show trial, it brought home to the world the true horrors of the
crimes against humanity that were planned and authorised by the Nazi
leadership. The passion of the reports from those who first saw the
concentration camps (Richard Dimbleby's graphic report from Belsen is
quoted on the title pages) was backed up by the volumes of evidence
which the formal tribunals needed. In this way, the prosecution of
individuals for crimes against humanity, even when working for the
State, became a part of international law. While the book covers the
conduct and implications of Nuremberg in great detail, it is
strangely reticent on the parallel trials in Tokyo.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The second key event after the war was the
setting up of the United Nations. Its Charter has been the source of
authority for defining international standards of behaviour by
States. Human rights are given priority in the Charter. Yet, as with
most  international agreements, it contains caveats and constraints
in order to satisfy all the parties.  It was written in the light of
the horrific experiences in Nazi Germany, but some of the Allies
still had colonial considerations. The Charter recognised the
sovereignty of States by discounting intervention in essentially
domestic matters of any State. However this prohibition could be
overridden if the Security Council agreed that an armed intervention
were needed to restore international peace and security, or in the
case of self-defence. While this was a fairly weak approach to
enforcement of human rights, the General Assembly of the United
Nations adopted The Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948.

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Robertson describes the years of the Cold
War that followed as inglorious. Human rights abuse was widely
ignored as the nuclear stand off between the two superpowers took
precedence. He perhaps unfairly blames the diplomats for lack of
progress over the years. While diplomats may have put sovereignty
issues and their aversion to international confrontation ahead of 
human rights issues, they were doing this at the behest of their
national political leaderships. Yet despite the repressive regimes in
Latin America, Asia and in the Communist States, there was progress
in the second half of the century.  The European Convention on Human
Rights built up an increasing power after an unsteady beginning in
1950. The European Court is able to provide an appeal mechanism for
individuals whose human rights have been abused by their governments.
 While there are still improvements to be made to this system, it
serves as an excellent model for other regions of the world.</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	There are now a number of indications that
the international community is ready to move forward to a more
comprehensive legal  system for the promotion of human rights and the
prosecution of those who have conducted crimes against humanity.
There are no lack of conventions against specific abuses. In the case
of war, there is detailed guidance on permissable types of weapons,
treatment of prisoners, protection of civilians in general and
children in particular. Genocide, torture and slavery are banned
throughout the world. What was lacking was any political consensus on
how to enforce the law. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The last decade has seen international
attitudes change markedly. The series of atrocities stemming from the
break up of Yugoslavia has shocked the world. The International
Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia was established by the UN
Security Council in 1993 as a result of the horrific ethnic cleansing
carried out by the Bosnian Serbs. It was nearly 50 years since the
precedent had been set at Nuremberg. Progress has been slow but
steady with some 25 out of 75 indicted war criminals in custody in
the Hague so far.  Experience with this Tribunal did much to
accelerate the process of setting up an International Criminal Court,
which was agreed in Rome by 120 nations in 1998. This Court is
intended to have a global remit and its jurisdiction covers genocide,
crimes against humanity, war crimes and the crime of aggression (once
the signatories have agreed on a definition of aggression).  However,
a number of States remained concerned at the implications for their
sovereignty. In particular the United States has made it clear that
it does not intend to let its citizens be tried by such an
international court.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Despite the difficulties in setting up a
court with universal jurisdiction, two events happened over the past
year, which give hope. The surprising arrest of General Pinochet on
one of his regular visits to Britain signalled a major change in
human rights accountability. Robertson recounts the story in loving
detail, and manages to get in verbal strikes at a number of his
enemies. But even without his triumphal prose, he is right that "the
Pinochet Case became the most important test for international Law
since Nuremberg itself". Whatever the final outcome, heads of State
can no longer assume that they can be granted amnesty in perpuity for
their crimes against humanity. The second crucial event was the NATO
operation against Kosovo. Unable to get  clear UN backing for armed
intervention to prevent ethnic cleansing, the 19 democratic nations
of NATO took action. While international lawyers can construct
appropriate rationales to cover the operation, there is no doubt that
it marked a new departure. If the problems of sovereignty stopped the
Security Council from acting according its own declaration on human
rights, then NATO was prepared to do it. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	"Crimes against humanity" is a fascinating
book for anyone in the field of International Relations. It is not
written with the emotional detachment of the lawyer but  with
passion, anger and occasional satisfaction. It gives no space to
those who would argue that we may come to regret the move towards
greater intervention in the internal affairs of states. There are
many potential ethnic flashpoints around the world, and not much
prospect of NATO enforcing a solution on them all. While democracies
are on the increase, we still need to deal with countries without
democracy. Criminalising their leadership may make it more difficult
for them to change. These difficult issues will not disappear, but
Robertson makes a convincing case for the need for much more effort
internationally.</FONT></P>
