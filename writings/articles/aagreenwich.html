<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Our session this morning is designed to round off your air power
phase.  I know you have covered the nuts and bolts of RAF
organisation, the philosophical and practical development of air
power, and the application through our two operational Commands. You
have also had the chance to visit a range of RAF units and exchange
ideas with the frontline.  Given all that one approach would be for
me to stop now and ask for questions. I do not doubt that the
operators from the lowest level of the squadron crewroom to the most
senior commanders will have given you plenty of food for thought on
what the RAF of today needs and where it should be going in the
future. I also hope that you will  have some ideas of your own -
which may be different!  But before we open the debate, I do need to
explore with you the constraints of the real world and how I see the
way ahead in the light of wider defence considerations.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Span of ACAS</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>First a reminder of my role in all this.  After the Heseltine
reorganisation of the MOD, the 3/4 star VCAS and his 3 assistant
chiefs - one for policy, one for operations and one for operational
requirements were removed. The OR aspect moved in toto to the centre
as ACDS(OR)(Air); and the AFD was left with a single 2 star ACAS. The
other two services were similarly affected.  I am therefore a member
of the AFBSC, and responsible to the CAS for operational
effectiveness of the RAF. This means that despite the reorganisation,
I have legitimate interests in all the 3 areas previously controlled
by VCAS.  It makes it the very best Whitehall job, acting as the
focus for all policy issues which could affect the effectiveness of
the Royal Air Force. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I am therefore concerned with the day to day policy for operations
and for operational training, but at the same time must work at
informing the Defence Programme process to ensure that the future air
force is properly equipped to meet its future tasks.  It is a job
which inevitably has a finger in every pie, and in order to keep some
sense of coherence to my remarks this morning, I will concentrate on
3 topical issues which should serve to illustrate the approach I am
taking to providing the Royal Air Force's contribution to the overall
Defence Task.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>First I shall look briefly at our approach to Defence Options.
This is a good way of seeing our plans for the future. As I keep
telling people, it takes a very long time to reshape your priorities
when you are expanding, but you can do it all too quickly when you
are contracting. I will then briefly touch on first impressions from
the Gulf War, because they inevitably have an impact on the way we
see the future, and finally look at the art of the possible in terms
of the air force long term programme.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Options</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>You have had Options aspects from previous speakers, but let me
just remind you of the overall RAF measures. When Tom King made the
public announcement in the House on 25th July last year, he envisaged
that the four boat Trident force for nuclear deterrence would be
underpinned by a continuing sub-strategic force of dual capable
Tornados at much the same numerical level as before.   Effective
defence of the UK would remain a key requirement, and that meant a 
comprehensive air defence capability.   The planned Tornado F3 force
would be retained but the Phantoms would be withdrawn.   For the
contribution to the continent, he announced that our stationed forces
in Germany would be roughly halved, but that our contribution would
need to be shaped to fit the force structures of our Allies.   For
the RAF in Germany, he announced a reduction from 4 bases to 2, the
phasing out of the air defence contribution - allowing the Phantom to
be withdrawn from service-, the retention of the Harrier, a reduction
from 8 to 4 Tornado squadrons and a reduction in RAFG SH assets.   On
Berlin, he agreed to Chancellor Kohl's request that the 3 Western
powers would remain while Soviet forces remained in what was the GDR
and that meant we were to keep RAGF Gatow going until then.   In the
maritime area,   the RAF's anti surface ship capability provided by
the ageing Buccaneer would be replaced by one of the Tornado
squadrons withdrawn from Germany (the other 3 being kept in store)
and one of the UK squadrons - but both would keep their strike role
as well.   This was a modernization of our ASUW capability that we
had been seeking for some time. There would also be a  reduction in
our maritime reconnaissance force of Nimrods.  On manpower we would
decrease from around 90,000 to about 75,000.  The plan therefore took
the main cuts in Germany, phased out the Phantom early, and looked to
greater multi-roling. We were therefore broadly content with the
approach, although we felt that we had perhaps lost one Tornado GR1
squadron more than was prudent.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Just as the RN formed its NOFOG, we formed DOIT to look at the
best way to implement these reductions and generate the maximum
benefits in savings on support costs. Obviously a reduction in the
estate was implicit in this work, and this gave us the chance to
consider 3 groups of factors:</P>

<P>					</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>-	Operational</P>

<P>	--	Location; sensitive to task and threat.</P>

<P>	--	Hardening/ Survivability.</P>

<P>		---	COB plans/NATO infrastructure programmes.</P>

<P>	--	Communications.</P>

<P>		Future EFA requirements</P>

<P>-	Economic</P>

<P>	--	Relocation costs.</P>

<P>	--	Reduction in estate support costs.</P>

<P>	--	Manpower mix / contractorisation.</P>

<P>	</P>

<P>-	Quality of Life</P>

<P>	--	Station facilities.</P>

<P>	--	Turbulence/Timing of personnel moves</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The rundown of RAFG was critical to all the other work, and
provides a good illustration of the way we have tackled this
opportunity, and I will mention it only briefly as Deputy Commander
RAFG has doubtless covered it.   Although taking the cuts where they
fell would have suggested that we should close Wildenrath and then
either Laarbruch or Bruggen, there were other factors.   We were of
course conscious of the relative environmental impact of the various
bases.   Also the closure of two bases close to each other would have
a relatively greater impact on the German economy.   More
importantly, from an operational and quality of life aspect, there
was much to be said for closing Gutersloh - it had dispersed
quarters, was cramped, lacked the survivability of the Tornado bases,
and of course its proximity to the IGB was no longer as relevant.   
For all these reasons we were able to develop a plot which favoured
basing 4 Tornado squadrons at Bruggen, and retained Laarbruch, with
its good infrastructure and survivability, as the base for the other
RAFG elements - the Harriers and a proportion of the helicopters.   I
say "a proportion" because we do not yet having an agreed role and
force level for the British Army in Germany.   We are also now
looking at how we need to operate the Harrier in the future given the
strange geostrategic considerations stemming from Unification.We
expect to be able to draw our AD forces down over the next year,
making Wildenrath available for closure from the end of 1992.  
Gutersloh will take a little longer as we will have to wait until the
Tornados have gone from Laarbruch, before transferring the Harriers,
Chinooks and Pumas there.   We anticipate that, when the rundown is
complete, HQ RAFG will assume Group status under HQ STC, but
retaining certain direct links with the MOD.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	 We are looking to concentrate our Tornado GR1/GR1a/ASUW
operational units in the UK into 2 bases, and are examining the scope
to rationalise other basing arrangements, for example for the Nimrod,
SAR and Jaguar Forces and for the RAF Regiment.   Throughout such
changes, we seek to stagger events to limit the effects of turbulence
on our personnel and on the training machine.   In similar vein, we
are looking at opportunities  to reduce further by concentrating
support activities, such as deep aircraft maintenance and storage
tasks, particularly where these will decrease in size.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Reductions in the Support Area which are at least proportionate
to those in the front line are assumed.   Some flow naturally from
removing types - the Phantom, the Buccaneer and the Hunter - from our
inventory, but we have also to capitalise on the smaller air force to
make more general savings in the whole of the support area.   A
Defence-wide Team headed by Sir Kenneth MacDonald, the former 2nd
PUS,  known as PROSPECT, has been established to pull together the
various elements of the Support Area Study, and also to review the
structure of MOD itself.  </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Training is another area where we are examining our future
needs closely.   Pilot shortfalls mean that we must maintain current
levels of flying training throughput.   Nevertheless, we have
developed proposals which will reduce our basic flying training
schools from 3 to 2, while the creation of 2 mirror image combined
AFTS/TWUs will permit closure of one of the Hawk flying training
bases.  </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Options then gave us a chance to restructure our inventory, and
as you can see, we decided to retain all our roles: sub-strategic
nuclear, air defence, offensive counter air, air interdiction, close
air support, reconnaissance, maritime, transport tactical and
strategic- fixed and rotary wing, and air to air refueling. A week
after the public announcement, Saddam invaded Kuwait and the first
lesson of the Gulf became apparent: you never know quite what you are
going to be asked to do in the future, and therefore giving up
capabilities in a particular role can be a dangerous economy. 
Moreover the balance between equipment and people will remain as
important as ever. As I indicated we are very concious of quality of
life aspects in our options work. We are fortunate that it does not
seem likely that we will need to have redundancy. But we do need to
make sure we have got our manpower planning right - we have been
operating with nearly a 10% deficit for far too long.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Granby &amp; Op Haven</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>You will excuse me if I don't give you a blow by blow account of
the Gulf War.  For once everyone was able through television to have
a vivid instantaneous picture of the various phases. It was a
coalition war and it was above all else an air war. From the UK
perspective this meant an immediate deployment of a squadron of F3
air defence Tornado - 48 hours from Go to in theatre and operational.
Another 48 hours and the first offensive aircraft - a squadron of
Jaguar. There followed progressively Tornado GR1 for greater
offensive power, GR1a for Recce, Buccaneer for laser designation,
Nimrods for the maritime ops, Chinooks and Pumas for support of the
ground forces, transport and tankers to support the whole operation.
Our aircraft were involved in every major role except sub-strategic
nuclear that I have just mentioned. It was a salutary warning that we
were right under Options not to contemplate giving up a major role
capability. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I will leave discussion of the particulars of the campaign to
questions. Let me just head up a few of the issues which need to be
considered for the future. Low level operations is certainly one. We
have optimised our aircraft and weapons for low level delivery
against the assumption that life would always be more dangerous the
higher you were. Since the air forces were given a relatively free
ride once above the height of AAA (and even that was relatively
ineffective), medium level operations became possible and we needed
some quick fixes in terms of weapons. Maybe that opportunity will
never come again, but we had better consider it  in our future
planning. Next is the question of balance between precision and dumb
weapons. Here it is easy to get so enthused by the shots of Cruise
Missiles and LGB attacks as to forget that the vast majority of
firepower delivered onto Iraq was conventional dumb bombs. Certainly
the high tech solutions were impressive, but they will never be
affordable in the numbers necessary to conduct a prolonged air
campaign. For many jobs, where collateral damage is not an issue,
they may not be the most effective weapon. The third issue to
consider is the question of how far we can depend on industry and PE
to pull out the stops to rectify known weaknesses at the last moment.
Just like Corporate, Granby was a great success story for such mods
across all our aircraft and weapons. But again that was a function of
available time before hostilities broke out - can we always plan on
that? Finally, I would raise the question of Reserves. The Gulf made
us realise how dependent we had already become on Reserves for
various specialist activities, and also the reluctance that Ministers
show when asked to authorise their use. Despite the pressures on
moving to greater use of Reserves, I believe the experience of the
Gulf War has shown that we need to be cautious.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The drain on our resources from the Gulf continues - we are just
recovering the last  Tornado squadron in theatre. Of course Operation
Haven, has also caused us to switch our Chinook assets to the North
now both in support of relief operations and also for those tasks
which 3 Cdo Sea King's can't do in the height and heat of the
mountains.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Lessons learned from the Gulf will be a time coming, but I can
hardly improve on the analysis of my good friend Lawrence Freedman,
Professor of War Studies at Kings London, who wrote in the
Independent on 1 March:</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>But if any one lesson can be drawn from this war it is this: that
it is impossible to conduct a ground war having conceded command of
the air to the enemy.  The allies were always able to fight in three
dimensions while Iraq was confined to only two.  Those responsible
for planning Western armed forces in the light of the end of the Cold
War will now seek to ensure that superiority in air power is never
lost.</P>

<H3>The Programme</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Well if we are to make his expectation come true, we must transfer
experience into the Defence Programme - but now is hardly the best
time to advocate major expansion in any particular area of the
budget.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>There are a number of factors which we must pull together if we
are to examine the art of the possible, and make sure that our
beliefs in the employment of air power are reflected in our
operational equipment.  They include the threat, the force structure
as it is today, political direction for the future, the promise of
technology, how OA plays for future force mixes, what our concepts
for the future will be - and those of our Allies- and finally as
always the question of resources.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>So what can I draw together from all these factors in terms of our
current and future doctrine. For the Threat, it is less certain, less
immediately catastrophic in Europe, but increasingly high intensity
wherever conflict breaks out. That suggests that deployability,
range, speed of reaction, and flexibility are the sort of key words
we need to look for in threat response. The Royal Air Force today
provides a balanced capability across the roles. Reconnaissance will
remain  a key activity, and every operation in peace, TTW and war
reinforces the message that aircraft are a crucial part of the
intelligence picture. A year ago, every presentation that I gave
would be laced with Arms Control. We are less optimistic now, but in
any event, recce was going to have an increasing part to play in the
confidence building which is the essential companion of any arms
control regime. Gaining control of the air is the key to successful
land or sea operations. It is impossible to predict whether offensive
or defensive counter air will have the ascendancy in any operation -
and the capability for both is therefore needed. Rapid application of
massive firepower will be needed in any conflict. The arguments about
the balance between close air support, battlefield air inderdiction
and deep inderdiction are sterile. Each is necessary, and the balance
between them is a dynamic of the battle. If choices have to be made
between systems, then we must go for the ones that can cover all
three requirements. Deployment of firepower may be in the form of
troops delivered by fixed or rotary wing air power. Sufficient range
and endurance is necessary for the unknown scenario of the future,
and that means both tactical and strategic tanking. The substrategic
nuclear system is best controlled by being an air delivered system. 
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>So we need everything, but the reality of resource constraints
says we cannot have everything.  What then is the answer? It must be
to retain roles through multi-roling aircraft, designing aircraft and
weapons for multi-role capability. The current structure of the Royal
Air Force reflects this, the planning under options looked to retain
all the roles, and the procurement of EFA continues this pattern.  We
face a very uncertain world, and one in which flexibility - the key
characteristic of air power - will need to be exploited to the full. 
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>											</P>

<P>	Clearly,  Options work has been a key part of the LTC process. 
In cash terms, there were 2 main issues confronting the Department in
LTC 91.   First, in the Estimates Year,  the overall Defence
Programme exceeded the cash provided in the 1990 settlement by about
&#163;1.5Bn.   This means that savings measures have had to be run
against almost all uncommitted expenditure in the financial year
starting in April.   Secondly, there remains a question mark against
the affordability of the Options package, including from 1995 onwards
new assumptions that the Defence Budget will decline in real terms by
1% a year over the LTC period.   On this basis, we would have to
reduce the force structure envisaged in the Options proposals, and we
have had already to propose additional saving measures.   These
include the early phasing out of the Victor tankers and the
withdrawal of Bloodhound from service from 1 Jul 91 without immediate
replacement.   The Harrier and Hercules forces would also be trimmed.
  The retrenchment would extend to aircraft spares and repairs and,
also, to ground clothing, furniture, MT and communications.   The
total savings from the RAF alone, both Options and LTC 91 measures,
are well over &#163;9Bn across the LTC period. While the LTC is now
signed off for the estimates year only, it is clear that with an
election looming, Ministers will be wary of taking "courageous"
decisions.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P> In the air defence area, Tornado ADV's future is now, I think,
clear, and rather than pursue any major improvements for the F3
beyond the Stage 2 radar programme, (and we have had a significant
upgrade to a part of the fleet for use in the Gulf) we plan to
replace the  fleet progressively with EFA when it comes into Service,
starting at about the turn of the Century. I will be working hard to
ensure that it comes in in the right numbers with the right weapons.
One of the difficulties I will have to face is perhaps a constant
nibbling at force levels to meet short term savings requirements.  
Furthermore, we need to replace the Bloodhound capability as soon as
possible with a modern Surface to Air Missile. .   Introduction to
Service of our Airborne Early Warning aircraft, the E3D, is
progressing well, and I am pleased to report that the troubled
Improved UK Air Defence Ground Environment is now making good
progress.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P> 	On the maritime side, an early replacement for Nimrod is the
priority.   We had planned to purchase the Lockheed P7, but this is
no longer under development, and therefore we are now examining
closely an enhanced Lockheed P3-C.   Our Maritime attack capability
has been addressed as part of Options, as discussed earlier by
replacing Buccaneer with Tornado.  </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P> 	The Tornado GRl has received some excellent modifications for
Operation GRANBY and with a major fleet enhancement programme
imminent, it is set to retain its effectiveness well into the first
decade of the next Century.   A replacement for the Tornado GRl's
tactical nuclear weapon is  required, and a decision on the way ahead
for a stand-off nuclear weapon is due to be taken later this year.  
On the conventional weapons front, we are addressing the  development
of a stand-off weapon to replace the JP 233 and, at the moment,
funding is firm to meet this requirement.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Turning to the Jaguar, during our Options for Change
deliberations we concluded that, because the fleet was
extraordinarily cost-effective for its firepower, it should remain in
Service ( and the Gulf proved this beyond doubt).   The question of
whether or not it should eventually be replaced was, however, left
open. The core assumption remains replacement by EFA on a one-for-one
basis, and I will be stressing EFA's multi-role characteristics in
preparation for the production investment decision which is due next
year.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Turning to Recce, our proposals for tactical recce envisage an
eventual rationalisation on Tornado and EFA, and we are still
examining how we fund a Recce capability for the Harrier GR5/7.   For
strategic tasks, we plan to replace the PR9 Canberra with an aircraft
such as Gulfstream, which will primarily provide a long range
stand-off radar capability and also be available for CFE verification
and Open Skies. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>We decided recently to rationalise the Air Transport and Air to
Air Refuelling fleets because of the declining availability of the
passenger version of the VC10 and the rising cost of the projected
Tristar refuelling pod programme.   To offset the loss of planned
air-to-air refuelling capability, we have funded the conversion of
the remaining 5 passenger VClOs to 2-point tankers.   However, we
have not been able, this year, to fund a new VVIP transport to
undertake both the Andover and VC10 VVIP tasks.  For the Air
Transport Force plot, our priority is the introduction of the   
C-130J on a rolling replacement programme for the Hercules.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P> </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>There is also a glimmer of light at the end of the long and dark
Support Helicopter tunnel, and we now intend to replace most of the
Puma fleet by a new Light Support Helicopter, which will, in turn,
allow the ageing Wessex to be replaced and retired.     	</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>So, where do we go from here?   There is no doubt that, after the
major changes induced by Options and LTC 91, we will need to redress
some imbalances and incoherences which are likely to exist in the
programme.   We are at the beginning of that process now, and it is
too early to predict how things will develop.   However, a central
aim must be to achieve the right balance of the new force structure.
</P>

<P> </P>

<P>	In addressing Options, I have already spoken of the balance
between people and equipment and between the front line and the
support area.   The balance I have not yet addressed is the key one
of platforms and weapons, and this is where LTC 91 has been
particularly difficult since weapons constitute a major and
increasingly expensive element of the equipment programme and have,
therefore, been vulnerable.   Important new weapons in prospect
include ASRAAM, the Advanced Short Range Air-to-Air Missile, with
which we have made encouraging progress in the last year, and 1238
which is our projected stand-off anti-armour weapon.   Despite
technical, financial and inter-Service difficulties, we hope to make
good progress in the coming year on this important advanced air
delivered anti-armour weapon.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>					</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Concluding Remarks</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>		From what I have said, you will appreciate that the
budgetary problems we are facing  are very severe .  In the next year
or two, unless there is either a significant increase in money for
Defence or a change in allocation between Services, we could well
expect further cuts above those in the announced Options package 
which I described earlier.   But, at this stage, I would hesitate to
make firm predictions.   Lessons from Operation GRANBY could be  very
significant.     Coupled with this, the deteriorating situation in
the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe presents a clear warning against
irrevocably weakening our long-term defence posture still further in
order to resolve short-term economic problems.   At he same time, the
economy is in recession, and the Government will not find it easy to
improve the Defence Budget in the light of all the other claims upon
the Treasury.   I believe in all of this, and in the increasing
emphasis on mobility, rapid reinforcement and Out Of Area capability,
that the role of air power becomes ever more important, and the Gulf
War has shown that to the world. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>We must preserve a balanced air force to be capable of reacting to
all eventualities.   If resource constraints  in the end drive force
levels down, we must retain the ability to expand them rapidly and
sufficiently should the need arise.  It is clear that the more we can
adopt multi-role capabilities the better we can face these
uncertainties, and this is another reason why EFA is so important to
our future security.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I have covered a vast amount of material in an all too short time.
Life in the Ministry has never been more exciting. We first had
aircraft arms control to deal with, then the extraordinary changes in
Europe and the Soviet Union. These have not yet finished, and time
has not allowed me to address the possible changes in NATO that we
must take into account. We may not be allowed to call Options a
Defence Review, but as you can see the implications are as profound
for all three Services. Despite that, we have still not cut the
Defence programme back enough for it to be affordable, and the
current LTC is the most difficult ever, and is not yet complete. On
top of all that we have started and finished a major conflict within
this financial year, and one in which perceptions of air power should
have been changed radically. As we refocus on Europe and the Soviet
Union, it looks a little less comfortable a view than it did a year
ago.  All in all, I am looking forward to a stimulating tour as ACAS!
