<P><STRONG><EM><FONT SIZE=4>Comalco Announces Weipa Restructuring
Plan<BR>

</FONT></EM></STRONG><BR>

Comalco Limited has announced a major overhaul of its Weipa
operations to improve its competitive position, enhance the long-term
security of its bauxite mine and facilitate its proposed alumina
refinery investment.<BR>

<BR>

The restructuring plan includes:<BR>

</P>

<UL>
   <LI>A re-equipment programme, involving reduction and renewal of
   the mine's truck fleet, extension of the mine railway network and
   upgrading of the bauxite processing plant. This will enable the
   same volume of bauxite to be produced more effectively.<BR>
   
   
   
   <LI>Rationalisation of the Brisbane and Weipa management of the
   operating business unit, Comalco Minerals and Alumina (CM&amp;A).
   This will ultimately halve the management numbers.<BR>
   
   
   
   <LI>Cessation of Weipa kaolin production. The substantial further
   investment required to achieve a sustainable market share cannot
   be justified by profitability projections. Continuing at the
   current production rate of 110,000 tonnes per year is not
   economically viable. People in 93 kaolin roles will be affected,
   although it is expected that a significant number will be placed
   within CM&amp;A or other Group companies. The kaolin plant will be
   placed on a care and maintenance basis at this stage.<BR>
   

</UL>

<P>Subject to completion of estimates, Comalco Limited will incur an
abnormal charge to 1996 earnings of up to A$40 million net after tax
as a result of closing the kaolin business.<BR>

<BR>

<BR>

The proposed process improvements mean that Weipa will operate with a
significantly smaller workforce in the future. To date 60 people have
chosen voluntary redundancy packages as part of this restructuring
programme.<BR>

<BR>

CM&amp;A's Managing Director, Rod Kinkead-Weekes, said that these
changes would be staggered over the next two to three years. "They
come as no surprise to our employees, who have been regularly
informed of the need to make our Weipa business more competitive. My
expectation is that there will not be many involuntary retrenchments.
Our turnover rate is 60-70 people a year. We are taking every step
possible to seek out opportunities for Group transfers and we are
providing a generous and non-discriminatory redundancy package which
will be fair to all employees," he said.</P>
