<P>	It has taken the new Labour Government longer  than a year to
analyse its defence needs, and to decide that more than &#163;22
Billion a year is still needed for military purposes. Many feared (or
hoped) that public expenditure on defence would be transferred by the
new administration to education, health or other domestic needs. Why
do we still need the capacity to fight wars, now that the dangers of
the Cold War are over?  Is mankind naturally predisposed to settling
problems by state authorised violence? Is military power a necessary
part of diplomacy? These two books give some insights into these
questions.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Professor Black takes a historian's approach to the question of
why wars happen. It is a long perspective looking back to the 15th
Century as his start point, and as such may, at times, seem to have
little relevance to the strategist of the late 20th Century.  He
seeks to establish whether wars primarily reflect bellicosity in
society and states, or whether they are accidental and should be
blamed on poor diplomacy. If generalisation at this level were not
difficult enough, he also seeks a picture that covers the whole
world, and not just Europeanized nations.  </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	The canvas is enormous both in space and time, and the task is
further complicated by the difficulty of defining what is meant by
war. Fighting can range from local tribal disputes to the carnage of
the Somme or the atomic destruction of Hiroshima. Much of the lower
level conflicts  in distant parts go unrecorded even today, and
certainly in past centuries. The author draws on his encyclopaedic
knowledge of wars of the past 500 years, but at times the shear
number of examples leaves the reader unsure of the common lessons to
be drawn. He seeks to use diplomatic archives as a primary source for
his analysis. He claims that diplomats are reflective and understand
the source, use and purpose of power. Less helpfully, they may write
from a very particular viewpoint.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	The period of two hundred years from 1450  ("An age of
expansion") was a rough time to be an ordinary citizen. Force was an
accepted method of dispute settlement. The author parodies Clausewitz
by asserting that: "War was the continuation of litigation by other
means". States became defined by wars, but no generally applicable
rationale for war emerges from his review of conflicts. The period
from 1650 to 1775, which he subtitles "An age of Limited War?", is no
clearer. Examples range from attacks on tax gatherers to the European
fighting at sea and on land. Some were wars of opportunity, some of
fear and some of conquest. Rebellions could be far more bloody than
declared wars. 85,000 Hungarians were killed in the Rakoczi rising. 
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Wars of revolution and nationalism characterise the period from
1775 to the start of the First World War. The American War of
Independence, the French Revolutionary Wars,  the American Civil War 
and Napoleon's campaigns were all motivated by different factors. As
Professor Black notes, these are wars which have much more in common
with  modern conflicts. However he believes that  "the bellicist
culture of the period ensured a greater willingness to kill and be
killed than in Western society in the 1990s". There could be other
reasons for a willingness to accept casualties, and it is not clear
that the soldier of the 1990s is any more fearful than his great
grandfather was. The wars of imperialism that overlap this period had
yet other causes. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Total War arrives in 1914, and for the purposes of this book
extends to 1945. This is a somewhat arbitrary period. In earlier
days, the American Civil War used industrial capacity to support war
effort, and any war after 1945 had the potential for even greater
destruction than those that had gone before. The causes of both world
wars have been analysed extensively, and Black covers familiar
ground. He reflects on the question of whether democracies are less
prone to start wars than  dictatorships, and concludes there is
little evidence to support this view. Indeed, he might have concluded
that democracies are more likely to start wars; but only against
non-democratic states. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	The Cold  War chapter covers not just the superpower
confrontation, but  also the problems of decolonisation. This is a
period which generated a massive industry in the arcane field of
nuclear strategy, and its application in the prevention of war. Yet
the role of atomic weapons in this period is hardly mentioned by
Professor Black, who puts no entry against  "nuclear" in his index.
This is particularly strange as the book has promised to reveal how
far are the causes of war related to the changes in the nature of
warfare. The final period examined is from 1990 to the present day,
and this is a rather less academic review of the flash points of
today. He suggests that  we may be experiencing a decline in
bellicosity in the West. The evidence on this is hardly conclusive
after the experiences of the Falklands, the Gulf, and operations in
the former Yugoslavia. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	A book which covers such a long period of the history of
conflict over the whole globe is bound to be restricted to brief
analysis of each campaign. The reader is asked to conclude that wars
happen because of cultural contexts. That bellicose nations and
bellicose leaders initiate wars is scarcely a surprise. However, for
the modern strategist, the requirement is to find how to prevent
wars. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Nuclear deterrence was important in preventing a superpower
war, but we still need effective mechanisms for preventing conflict
below the level of world war. Coercion offers one approach, and
Professor Freedman has assembled an impressive collection of views on
concepts and cases of strategic coercion.  The essence of strategic
coercion is to persuade the target to change his behaviour to the
desired  mode  through a threat of punishment  for failing to comply
with the demand. Deterrence seeks only to prevent a hostile act by an
enemy; coercion  seeks to change the situation. This book also looks
at different times and places to avoid a purely western view.
However, by taking a limited number of concrete examples and
analysing them in depth, a more convincing picture is built up.
Coercion is not just an instrument of the state. It can be, and is,
used by sub state actors as well as multilateral organisations. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	This year we have seen the United States, with the support of
some allies, deploy a naval force to the Gulf in order to coerce
Sadam Hussein into accepting the United Nations inspection teams.
Although, many had severe doubts about the outcome if an air attack
had to be launched against Iraq, the strategy of coercive deployment
of military force had the desired diplomatic outcome. Again, NATO has
attempted to modify the behaviour of the Serbs in Kosovo by the
deployment of allied air power. In this case the effect has been less
clear cut,  but seems to have accelerated the diplomatic process.
There are no lack of opportunities for applying coercion around the
world, and Professor Freedman has timed his book well. As he notes,
the Cold War literature was dominated by the special case of
deterrence theory, in which states were coerced into not doing
anything hostile to one another.  The use of threats to pressure
others into doing things that they did not wish to received less
attention. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	The dozen contributors range broadly. The Balkans, as a target
for coercion by great powers, in the last century and in 1914 are
covered in one chapter. Later in the book, the use of coercion in
recent days in the region is examined. The break up of Yugoslavia is
rich in examples of coercive behaviour by both internal and external
parties. Asia is also a source of many contemporary cases studies.
The interaction between India and Pakistan is well covered, and has a
topical relevance given their recent nuclear tests. Cambodia and
North Korea provide interesting examples of prolonged exposure to
external coercion by the United Nations and the United States. Latin
America has been the target for a number of strategic coercion
measures by the United States in recent times. Three cases are
outlined: Haiti, Cuba and Brazil. While the first two events will be
well known to the security specialist, the use of coercive diplomacy
for economic bargaining over intellectual property  rights in Brazil
reminds us that not all cases will be security related. Indeed there
seems to be a trend for the United States to use its powers for
coercion in the economic field more and more.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	The role of coercion in dealing with terrorism and drug
traffickers is addressed briefly and inconclusively. We are asked to
take comfort in the fact that both are easier to deal with if state
sponsored.  Coercion and non-state actors are covered in an
interesting chapter on the Palestinian Liberation Organization in
Lebanon from 1969-1976. Oil is a key economic issue for Russia, and
another section examines recent Russian actions towards its
neighbours in the new oil regions. Control of pipeline routes becomes
a powerful coercive weapon.  </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	 Africa remains an area of great concern to the international
community. The methods of resolving recent conflicts and crises in
Liberia, Somalia and the Great Lakes are reviewed.  Here the
solutions are less easy to find.  The difficulties are well
illustrated by the attempts of the international community to
influence events in Rwanda, Burundi and Zaire over the past 7 years.
Clement Adibe concludes that  the intervention in Africa by the
international community has probably made things worse. He advocates
the use of preventive diplomacy in preference to strategic coercion.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	In an age where human rights abuses are graphically shown in
every home as they happen around the world, the clamour for the
international community to do something  is ever present. The
permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, and many
other states, continue to maintain significant military forces in
being despite there being no direct threats to their territories. The
deployment of these forces offer one way that governments can be seen
to be doing something about the world's problems. Strategic coercion
can only work if the implicit threat of the ultimate use of force is
real. This means that from time to time fighting will happen because
coercion has failed. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	The policy framework for Britain's defence strategy was
published as part of the government's strategic defence review in
early July.  "The new challenges we face will call for the combined
application of all the tools at our disposal - diplomatic, economic,
trade, developmental, as well as the Armed Forces. In the changed
world there is a new and growing role for preventive diplomacy which
brings all these tools to bear to avert conflict before military
intervention is required." Both of these books reinforce that message
from the Defence White Paper.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Strategic coercion can lead to military involvement that fails
to solve the underlying problems. Yet  armed forces provide an easy
answer for politicians who wish to be seen as doing something.
Economic aid, diplomacy, training and working through 
non-governmental organisations may produce better results in many
troubled areas at lower cost.  Military forces will be needed for the
intractable cases where national interests are at risk; or where all
forms of preventive diplomacy have failed and  instability is likely
to spread.  While both volumes will be of interest to the strategic
specialist, the case studies in Professor Freedman's excellent
collection should be required reading in the corridors of power of
the United Nations, NATO and those nations who claim a special
responsibility for peace in the wider world.</P>
