			<p>Politics affects every aspect of future expeditionary operations. The political grand strategic approach to future security requirements will shape the defence programme. Long lead times for air equipment and training mean that poor judgments can affect capabilities into the distant future. Even with a good defence strategy, the priorities for public expenditure will be shaped by political imperatives, which may be quite different from the military factors. Here high costs of acquisition for air power assets compete with rising personnel costs in a constrained defence budget. Arguments about future efficiencies through the use of expeditionary air power have to be set against more near term political electoral issues.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Even if defence objectives could be isolated from the competing public funding priorities, the defence procurement system is subject to political pressure. The unique position of national defence industries allows political adjustment to defence priorities and creates less than perfect markets.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Finally, politics determines operational aspects. It constrains which operations will be undertaken, how coalitions will form, and what tactics and weapons may be used. When politics determines that &quot;something should be done&quot;, it will also influence what combination of&nbsp; economic, diplomatic and military intervention is to be used. Air power offers rapid response to problems without subsequent extraction problems. It can easily be slotted into larger coalition or alliance operations, and is relatively affordable for prolonged periods. However, it may be seen as less appropriate for post conflict operations. When the United States dominates air power provision, particular levels of force capabilities become more difficult for smaller nations to justify.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Looking to the future, these factors are likely to indicate a continuing reduction in the size of all European air forces and perhaps a greater shift towards direct support capabilities for land forces.</p>
