<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Scientists have always held political as
well as technological views about the way that a better world could
be constructed. Unfortunately, their scientific work usually takes
precedence, and they fail  to enter  into the political process. In
"Reason Enough  to Hope"  two physicists from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology seek to apply scientific method to explore
what possible global security arrangements would help to push the
world towards peace . Their starting point is that the world is at a
watershed in its development. They believe that we are reaching the
end of mankind's population growth and have already reached the
limits of warfare. While they are realistic in assuming that their
proposals will not come to pass, they believe that, by showing that a
better sustainable world is  achievable in a relatively short time,
they can motivate  policy makers to move in the right direction.

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Many readers will be surprised that the
global demographic trends are taken as a cause for hope rather than
despair. Increasing population is more usually quoted as the cause of
environmental degradation, conflict, disease, famine and war. Yet, as
the authors show, the global  population growth rate peaked 30 years
ago. The total number of people on the Earth is not yet stabilised,
but there has been a consistent and universal decline in growth
rates. The African continent was the last to pass its peak, and that
was ten years ago. It is likely that the 1990s will see the largest
number of additional human beings in any decade since mankind
evolved. Future increments will be smaller, and the authors predict
zero growth before the year 2100. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Having established that the population
explosion is over, they turn to the terrors of war, disease and
poverty. Using average life expectancy as a benchmark, they show
that, with the exception of preventing nuclear war, reducing poverty
is the most important factor to be considered in improving the lot of
mankind. The remainder of the book examines how the United States
could make policy changes which would reduce the risk of nuclear war,
free up resources from the defence budget, and lead the rest of the
world away from the cliff edge. Throughout the Cold War, Tsipis was a
regular contributor to Scientific American on nuclear weapon issues.
His detailed knowledge is reflected in a convincing chapter on what
the US nuclear armoury should look like in the next century.  Nuclear
security would be comprehensively assured with a reduction to 1030
warheads, which is one fifth the number that was proposed by the
Bush-Yeltsin agreement of 1993. Surprisingly, the authors advocate
that Britain should negotiate away its nuclear gravity bombs. They
appear to have missed the unilateral action already taken by the UK,
which has removed all tactical nuclear weapons, including bombs, from
service.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	They argue for the reduction in nuclear
forces, and  for measures to prevent proliferation, as a way to
reduce the risk of a nuclear disaster. Their non-proliferation  and
common security policy seeks to empower the United Nations in a way
that is unlikely to appeal to most  Americans. Not only does it
advocate a major international armed force for the UN, but it also
suggests an international nuclear deterrent force controlled by an
enlarged UN Security Council. However, reductions in nuclear forces
alone will not release many dollars from defence budgets. The 
authors move on to examine in detail what conventional forces the
United States will need in their future. Tank numbers are slashed by
a factor of 6, combat aircraft by 3 and the number of aircraft
carriers and submarines halved.  Regular forces would be reduced to
600,000 or a third of their current strength. The smaller forces
would be restructured to support the United Nations and at the same
time would free some $130 billion a year for helping development
worldwide. Today President Clinton is proposing to increase the
defence budget. They show how the costs of the current US security
policy are of the same order as their more hopeful policy for
engagement and common development, which would lead to a more
peaceful and prosperous world.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The authors agree that few will believe
that their vision can be realised. Yet they demonstrate convincingly
that it is  possible to imagine a path to a better sustainable world,
and it is one in which everyone can be a winner. They are right to
focus on the role that the United States can play, and I hope that
their book is read widely by American opinion formers. For the rest
of us, it is comforting, among all the predictions of future
catastrophe, to find a scientific analysis of why there is reason to
hope.</FONT></P>
