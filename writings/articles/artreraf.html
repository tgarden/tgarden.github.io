<H2><CENTER>Re-inventing the Royal Air Force</CENTER></H2>

<H3><CENTER><I>Sir Timothy Garden</I></CENTER></H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>If the Royal Air Force were a person, it might be suspected of
having manic depressive tendencies. Periods of great elation, (its
founding, the Battle of Britain, the nuclear deterrent, the Gulf War)
interspersed with periods of gloom and despair (the post WW1 rundown,
the Sandys review, the cutbacks of the 70s). Recently, there has been
some debate as to whether all is well with the Service. Is this
concern justified? Is it the down wave of some cyclical corporate
depression? Or is it something new?</P>

<P>There is an understandable, and probably universal, belief that we
all live in times quite different from those experienced by our
predecessors. Yet in this century, there has been a succession of
military, political and social revolutions. World War 1 changed the
nature of warfare, and the demands on the armed forces as a result.
The establishment of the independent Royal Air Force in the latter
days of that war was one indication of the revolution in warfare.
Proper investment in air power was essential to secure victory in any
future battle. Most other nations have eventually followed the
pattern, set by Churchill and Smuts, of forming a new third air arm
within their military.</P>

<H3>The Struggle for Survival</H3>

<P>From the earliest days, the RAF has had its share of controversial
figures. It is often forgotten that Sir Hugh Trenchard tendered his
resignation as Chief of the Air Staff two weeks before his Royal Air
Force was to be established. He was brought back by Churchill after
the war and served for another 10 years as CAS. It was this post-war
period which was so important to the future of the RAF. After the
armistice, the rapidly growing force was reversed into even more
rapid decline. The 251/2 squadrons that were authorised were less
than a tenth of those at the end of the war. A quarter of a million
men were demobbed, and Trenchard was being criticised for spending
some &#163;13m of his &#163;15m budget on building works at home. As
Andrew Boyle writes of this period in his biography of Trenchard:
</P>

<P>Lacking ready cash Trenchard had to hasten slowly. Unwanted
wartime stations could be closed only as fast as the leases and scrap
could be disposed of. The delays hardly encouraged cheerfulness or
hope among the officers and men obliged to remain as uniformed
caretakers. A sense of gloomy desolation swept the service in 1920
affecting high and low alike, at home and overseas.</P>

<P>Yet against this background, Trenchard fought off continual
attempts to re-absorb the air force into the army and navy. He
showed, first in Somaliland against the Mad Mullah and then in Iraq,
that his tiny force could conduct operations to control rebellions,
which would have taken the army several divisions. He carried through
his vision of building the elements from which a much larger air
force could grow, when the time came. Trenchard would be familiar
with many of the trials of modern military leadership. In 1927, he
held a not very successful press conference in response to the
popular papers, which were stimulating a public outcry over an
unfortunate run of flying accidents. But it was also the time of new
speed and distance records, and the great flying displays, which
attracted more favourable publicity for airmen.</P>

<H3>Preparing for War</H3>

<P>Sir Edward Ellington had no easier time as CAS from 1933 to 1937.
He had to take a force of 30,000 men operating wooden biplanes and
turn it into a modern war machine for the coming war, and initially
at a time when disarmament was still the culture. He does not appear
to have impressed his fellow Chiefs or his subordinates. Yet he
oversaw all the key initiatives which led to the new bomber and air
defence capabilities. The RAF changed in an amazingly short time from
canvas and piano wire technology to the production of metal
monoplanes with great speed, range and firepower. Yet as we now know,
it was nearly too late. In September 1939, the state of the RAF was
not one which gave any comfort to those in the know. All three
Commands lacked adequate numbers of aircraft, and two of the
Commanders-in-Chief (Fighter and Bomber) were in dispute with the Air
Staff over strategy.</P>

<P>The RAF's role in World War 2 remains a warm national memory. For
those who lived through that time, there is a special affection for
their boys in blue. Subsequent writings and films have ensured that
successor generations remember the Battle of Britain as the country's
finest hour despite the internal tensions within Fighter Command. Nor
has post-war criticism of the morality of the strategic bombing
campaign affected the high regard for the men who so courageously
carried out the task. Oddly, the key contribution of those involved
in the Battle of the Atlantic is less well remembered. It was a good
war for the long term reputation of the Royal Air Force.</P>

<H3>Managing Change</H3>

<P>Yet no sooner is the War over than RAF Commanders in India have to
take severe measures to quell a potential mutiny. The attempt to
return to policing the Empire from the air delayed demobilisation and
led to great unhappiness among the airmen. The post-war manpower
rundown was dramatic, with a drop in establishment of nearly a
million in the five years after 1944. The RAF reinvented itself for
the Cold War as the guardian of national nuclear deterrence through
the V Force. But the philosophy (and the expense) of deterrence meant
that, in 1957, Duncan Sandys, the Defence Minister of the day, called
into question the utility of the fighter force which defended the UK.
The reductions that followed the Sandys review, the unhappy tale of
the TSR2, and the technical failure of Skybolt as the nuclear
delivery system made Sir Thomas Pike's time as CAS in the early
1960's a bed of nails.</P>

<P>If Sandys had called into question the manned fighter, and Prime
Minister Macmillan had handed the key strategic bomber role to the
Polaris submarines, Denis Healey's review of the mid 1960's removed
the remnants of imperial policing East of Suez. The RAF might have
worried that it was losing all its roles. But in 1968, the adoption
of flexible response by NATO gave a new importance to the air power
contribution of the RAF in Germany and from the UK. The Alliance saw
air power as vital to its new strategy, and the RAF was able to show
its excellence through multi-national evaluations. This redefinition
of role provided the rationale for modern aircraft and weapons for
all its tasks.</P>

<P>Two decades as the UK's much valued contribution to the NATO
flexible response strategy was a period of great achievement for the
RAF. Many new modern aircraft types were introduced across all the
air power roles. But even in these times of modernisation, there were
periods of depression. A compulsory redundancy scheme in the mid
1970's, coupled with government pay restraint policy caused much
unhappiness, and a lack of confidence in the future. Outflows of
trained personnel were difficult to manage. In contrast, the 1980's
were a period of military as well as civil "feel good factor".
Success in the Falklands and a policy of real growth in defence
expenditure made the Services feel valued. The end of the Cold War
was a different kind of victory, but was nevertheless perceived as a
success for those who had secured the deterrent posture. The
subsequent Defence Options reductions were widely understood,
although at times painful. The timetable allowed for reasonable
management, and the smaller but better promise was seen to be
deliverable. The contribution of the air power in general, and the
RAF in particular, to success in the Gulf War was a further fillip to
the Service.</P>

<H3>Lessons for the Future</H3>

<P>In this historical perspective, it is difficult to be sure how
today's concerns will be rated by future historians. The new sharp
reductions to RAF manpower in the Front Line First exercise have a
demanding timetable for implementation, and the consequent redundancy
has been severe. As importantly, the personnel turbulence will take
some time to reduce to steady state. However, the graph of RAF
strengths shows that such dramatic change is not unprecedented. The
tabloid interest in personalities has not helped, but is a fact of
modern life. At the same time, the RAF has seen an extraordinary
series of commitments to future equipment. The Eurofighter 2000
programme has moved beyond the difficulties of the recent past. New
helicopters, transport aircraft, maritime reconnaissance aircraft and
various missiles, as well as updates to current aircraft have come
thick and fast. Our future historian will doubtless record this as a
difficult time in which the RAF secured a modern inventory to see it
well into the next century. What the RAF, along with the other two
Services, needs now is a clearly understood view of its new role. The
final withdrawal from Germany and the phasing out of its nuclear
weapons close the chapter of the flexible response era. UN Peace
Support operations will use air power, but not in the same sense as
the imperial policing role of the past.</P>

<P>What does all this tell us of current media perceptions of a
troubled RAF? They are nothing new. As the Service which lives on
technology and extols flexibility, the Royal Air Force has reinvented
itself a surprising number of times in its short history. It operates
expensive equipment and needs expensively trained people. It is
therefore always an attractive target for pruning when the nation
feels less threatened. The RAF is in better shape, both from an
equipment and capability aspect, than it has been at many such times
of change in the past. When it has hit difficulties, it has always
re-invented itself and emerged with capabilities appropriate for the
security needs of the age. That is the challenge for today.</P>
