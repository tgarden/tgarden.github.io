<H3><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Introduction</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">I fear that whatever I say tonight
will be glib, shallow and wrong. This is not surprising. If I am to
cover the world over the next 30 years in as many minutes, I must
inevitably skim over the fine detail of my analysis, and can only
look at some aspects of the potential developments in international
scene and the political, economic, technological, security and
environmental issues will interact. That is why any such presentation
will always lack depth. That it will be wrong is to learn the lessons
of past futurologists, forecasters and scenario writers. Yet in all
our businesses we have to plan for the future on the best guesses
that we can make. Every organisation needs a forward strategy, and
this will require planning assumptions about the future. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Most  of such planning tries to
extrapolate the experience of the recent past. This in military
circles is the trap of planning for the last war instead of the next
one. In the technology area extrapolations are sometimes made of the
experience of the small scale laboratory innovation to assume that it
will be adopted world-wide in a very short  time. The trouble with
all such forecasting is that it fails, by definition, to take into
account the unpredictable key events or applications of technology.
In international affairs, we have seen the change in the Middle East
that has resulted from an assassin's bullet which killed Prime
Minister Rabin.  The widescale use of integrated circuits has changed
the way that the world operates over the past 30 years. Putting
ourselves back 30 years, we might have expected that nuclear power
would have been providing us with clean  cheap energy. Yet Chernobyl
and 3 mile island have changed perspectives.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">So I start this look at the future
from a position of great humility. All I can do is give you some
possibilities for the way the world will develop. Like all scenario
building this allows us to judge whether a particular future world is
one that we would want. If it is not, then we may have options to
change the future and it will not come to pass. While my remit is to
include the effect of technology on industry, I look to you for this
expertise and hope we shall develop ideas in the discussion session
that follows.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">A Continuing World?</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">The first question to ask is
whether we expect there to be a viable planet for the next 30 years.
With the end of the Cold War, we have reduced the risk of
extinguishing life through a massive strategic nuclear exchange.
There are still more than enough nuclear weapons to put as risk the
viability of the planet, but we have more confidence that they will
not be used. To reduce the risk yet further means that we must
continue the arms reductions in this area. As the worry of a nuclear
winter have receded we have seen new global concerns emerge: ozone
layer depletion, global warming, over-fishing, reducing biodiversity,
atmospheric pollution, reduction in fresh water sources, population
growth, epidemics. None of these are likely to threaten the 
survivability of the species in the next 30 years, but all of them
represent key problems that will need to be addressed during the
period. There is also the random possibility of a strike by an
asteroid or comet, and it may be that the risk will be seen as
significant enough for work to be needed. However for the purpose of
tonight, I shall be assuming that  the world will make it to 2030,
and that the population will have risen from the current 6 Billion to
perhaps as much as 10 Billion. It is likely by then that India will
have overtaken China to become the most populous state on
earth.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">International relations</FONT>
</H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Any plan for the future must
consider the relations between states. There seems to be a growing
tendency for the power of the State to decline. In one direction,
many issues need to be dealt with at the supranational level.
Regional groupings form for economic reasons initially, but develop
into political entities. The debate over a federal Europe is all
about the vision of the economic community transforming into a
political entity with its own foreign and security policy. In other
parts of the world parallel moves are happening, but the others are
all at an earlier stage than the EU. We see NAFTA in North America,
Mercosur in South America, ASEAN in the Asia-Pacific, and so on. It
is too early to say how these regional groupings will mature: they
appear in some cases to look as though there are limits to the degree
of integration possible at the supranational level. Yet in 30 years
time, it would be surprising if some had not formed arrangements akin
to superstates. One might envisage a European, an American and an
Asian set of such groupings. They might by then be co-operating or
competing. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">At the supranational level, the
development of global organisations will also be important. The
United Nations may be very different. It might have become more
effective in its decision-making, have the power to implement
decisions, and be an effective monitor of international behaviour.
Perhaps, more likely, it will have become less effective as the
membership of the  security council is expanded, and decision making
becomes more difficult. Certainly the signs are that the process of
changing the membership may itself be pretty damaging as arguments
break out of which nations should represent particular regions. Many
would argue for a future where the UN  could act as the World's
policeman with appropriate forces on hand to enforce international
law. I rather doubt that this will come to pass in the next 30
years.The World Trade Organisation may however have developed to be a
far more important entity in moderating international behaviour. We
are in the early days yet, and there are plenty of opportunities for
it to lose power, particularly if the US is selective in which
rulings it is prepared to accept. However, given the universal
advantage in well regulated trade arrangements, it may be that WTO is
a better horse to back as a future global coordinator. We might in
the discussion talk about other ways of arranging the world's
affairs. Will International Law develop into a more codified
arrangement with agreed enforcement methods? If it does, it is more
likely to be by way of national economic self-interest than by the
emergence of a global agreement to an absolute set of rules for the
conduct of governments and individuals. What effects would this have
on multinationals ability to act beyond the control of single
governments?</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">States</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">How will the individual states and
regions develop? From an industrialist's point of view, you want to
know where the future markets will be, where the competition will
come from, which States would make partners, and which have dubious
investment possibilities. That is why the study of the international
system is a key requirement for industry, whether it is in the export
business or not. It has become a self evident truth to say that we
are all in a global market place now. At the manufacturing level,
plant will be built wherever in the world the best return on
investment can be achieved. Pricing policy must take in to account
global competition. Investment in technology is ever more necessary
to stay with the international market. The question is which are the
market winning areas for research, and how long will they give you a
market lead?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">If I take a spin around the world,
I can only give a very superficial analysis of the way States and
Regions seem to be moving. We have a perception today that the states
of Western Europe, including the UK, are stable, co-operative, rich
and technologically advanced. We worry about high costs of labour, we
enjoy reasonable growth, with unemployment a problem for many of the
countries. We look to an expansion of this sphere of stability to
encompass Central and eastern Europe. New members of the EU coming on
stream within 5 years, and an expectation that that process
continues. Problems may include FRY, Russia and the North African
littoral states. There are of course black scenarios which might look
at today as being the peak of EU development as the strains of
greater integration, and monetary union in particular, lead to a
fracturing of the carefully built consensus. Or that the strains of
taking on new members, without some fundamental reforms of the CAP,
cause the EU to stultify. Or that the great Russian democratic
experiment fails with a fall into complete lawlessness, anarchy or
military coup. Or that the populous poor of North Africa repeat the
Islamic invasion of the past, this time seeking food rather than
conquest.  All these are possible, but in my view less likely than a
progressive extension of the EU strengthening security and prosperity
in Europe.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">However, at the Eastern end of the
Mediterranean there is a more intractable problem between Israel and
its neighbouring states. 30 years ago Arab/Israeli wars happened, and
it may be that in 30 years time they remain possible. That the
current peace process was so profoundly affected by the murder of
Rabin is an indication of the difficulty in making predictions for
the region. However until there is a harmonious relationship between
an Israel that feels safe and a viable Palestinian state, it is
likely to remain a future worry. For the remainder of the Middle
East, the availability of oil is likely to be a factor which is of
interest to the rest of the world for another 30 years. I do not
share with some a fear of Fundamental Islam as a unifying force which
will change the political face of the globe. The differences within
the different factions of Islam are more than enough to prevent such
a single force operating in the next 30 years. Nor do I support the
views of Samuel Huntington who has written of a clash of
civilisations. Nevertheless, the hope of a global view of the
definition of individual rights and democracy will remain difficult
to formulate. We remain to an extent prisoners of the present when
thinking of the region. Thus we will worry about Iran and Iraq, but
it may be that over the next 30 years there will emerge other
personalities to worry us. Egypt has a problem with fundamentalists,
which it currently contains, but at the price of slowing up economic
reform. Saudi Arabia is not without its potential difficulties in
such a time span. Nevertheless, the practical man may take the
approach that oil is only of value if you can sell it. Therefore in
the end, the consumer nations have a lever to operate, as we see them
doing today in Iraq.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">But let me move on to the Asia
Pacific region. Here we have two questions to consider:  first, and
most importantly, where will China be in 30 years time; and second
what of the ASEAN nations? Again we find ourselves trapped in
extrapolations of what is happening at the moment. We flip-flop from
overoptimistic assumptions of prolonged double digit growth to
assuming that the current correction may be the end of the tiger
economies. In 30 years, the region will be more populous and more
developed. it will be consuming more resources and more power. It may
or may not be peaceful, and China will be a much more significant
player in the world. All this suggests that there is much to be said
for engaging China and drawing it into the global institutions such
as the WTO. Japan is more difficult to assess. It seems to be finding
great difficulty in adapting fast enough to the new global markets.
Certainly the Japanese opinion formers are acutely aware of the need
for reform. Korea still has the possibility to surprise the world,
and perhaps not in a pleasant way. In this look at the future, we can
postulate  either a unified Korea or a war devastated peninsular.
Either are possible. Nor is the Indian subcontinent's future assured.
There are good signs with the increase of high technology industry in
India, but it has not got its population problem under control. War
with Pakistan remains possible, but one hopes unlikely particularly
given that it could have a nuclear dimension.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">If we look at Africa, it is
difficult to envisage any rapid answer to the many problems of the
continent. The triumph  of the return to democracy in South Africa,
and also in Mozambique and Namibia gives hope for a region of
increasing stability and prosperity in the South. Yet criminality
could still undermine that, and it will be many years before such
potential prosperity would encompass Central Africa. It seems likely
that the world will have to help the Continent throughout the next 30
years. Whether it will continue to be willing to do so is another
question.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">In South America, the move away
from military dictatorships to democracies has been a good
development over the past few years. There are some thriving
economies with great potential. Yet crime and corruption, often drug
related, remains a significant problem. Environmental issues are also
likely to cause tensions between the developed world and some South
American states. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Most important of all, what is the
future for North America? The world will be very different depending
on whether the US becomes the world's policeman or retreats into
regional isolation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">As I indicated earlier, while many
of the potential problems of today and tomorrow need a supranational
approach, there is also a tendency for power to move downward from
States to individuals. The widening recognition of the need to
protect human rights, the wish for ethnic groups to have self
determination, increasing access to information, increasing education
of women, and the ability of individuals to communicate globally, are
all pointers to a future where States may decline in power, and in
some cases even break up into smaller parts.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Technology</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Having set the uncertainties of
the future world as my backdrop,  let me turn to my remit to give you
some thoughts on technology over the next 30 year. In doing this I
feel even more circumspect than I do about predicting the state of
the world. It is a common perception that we are in a time of
unprecedented rate of technological change. In some respects this is
obviously true, but I think there are some important caveats to be
made. At the end of the last century, scientists were beginning to
think they were within sight of having an explanation for everything
and an end to discovery. Indeed scientific discovery and
technological application to industrial processes was remarkable
then. There is perhaps a need to introduce the concept of effective
technology. Thus we have had heavier than air flight for just short
of a century, jet engines for half that time. We have developed
technology which allows us to fly at supersonic speeds, but with a
few exceptions, most air travel continues to be at the same high
subsonic speed that we have enjoyed for the past 30 years. If you
wish to improve transit times between London and New York, a better
return is achieved by speeding up the process of getting from the
centre of each city to the aircraft before it takes off. Similarly
the car has peaked in its effective speed. We have just demonstrated
that we have the technology for a supersonic car, but the speed of
traffic through cities is declining.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">None of this is to suggest a
Luddite view of pure and applied research. It is more to point to the
disparity between the extrapolation of the laboratory experiment to
full scale production in the sort of societies that we anticipate. I
remember lecturing in the 60s about the exciting possible future
applications for Lasers. While I might talk then about directed
energy weapons, they have been rather slow to be realised, and clever
repairs to detached retinas, which have happened but are hardly an
everyday experience; it never crossed my mind that every home today
would have a laser in its successor to the gramophone or every office
one in its successor to the typewriter.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">With all those health warnings,
which are the technologies which will mature over the next 30 years?
In trying to isolate a few tonight, I shall try to avoid the gimmicks
which may or may not capture the public imagination. It seems to me
to be more productive to look at the kinds of technology which might
either address the likely global problems over the next 30 years, or
might themselves be responsible for new problems on a global
scale.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Energy Generation</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">There is no doubt the global
energy requirements are set to continue to rise compounded both by
the population increases and the growth of the less developed
economies. We are already worrying about the implications of this for
the environment, the availability of both renewable and non-renewable
resources, and the implications for sustainable development. This
suggests that a key technology for the next 30 years must be in more
acceptable ways to generate energy. It is difficult to see how the
needs of the world are to be met without a growing dependence on
nuclear generation, despite the concerns about safety and long term
disposal issues. While fusion  still seems to offer hope, it is
perhaps only likely to become a commercial proposition towards the
end of the period we are considering. Alternative technologies will
also need to be pursued: photovoltaic, wind, hydroelectric will all
contribute - but it seems unlikely that  there will be some new
technology mature in time to meet the demands of the early part of
the next century. Perhaps speaking in this great Institute, I should
underline this as one of the great technological challenges of the
next 30 years. It seems to me that nuclear power will be the only
answer in that timescale.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Food</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">In looking at global needs, the
supply of food will continue to be a preoccupation for many. Here
technology is offering different visions. We have seen how the ever
more efficient fishing methods have led to the "tragedy of the
commons" with traditional fishing grounds depleted and in the case of
Labrador to an extent which causes industry to fail. There are those
that worry that the reduction in biodiversity also puts us at 
greater risk of famine. Desertification, global warming and
population growth, all have a negative impact  On the other hand
advances in biotechnology and genetic engineering may offer even
greater productivity, and produce new more robust foodstuffs.
Research needs to focus on both the management of food resources as
well as the methods by which world yield can be increased safely
without other polluting knock-on effects.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Water</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">If famine remains a concern, lack
of available fresh water is becoming an increasing cause for
potential conflict. While the technology for producing fresh water
from salt water is available, the energy requirements (and cost) have
significant implications. I am not offering any immediate new
technology solution, but it is a problem which needs addressing. It
has dimensions of management at the regional level as well as a need
for research into low energy methods of unpolluted water delivery to
remote parts of the globe.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Health</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">If we have been living through a
revolution brought about by the availability of vast computing
capacity, there is an expectation that we are moving into another
phase where biotechnology rather than physics will be the engine of
change. Just as it was difficult to foresee the effect of computers
everywhere some 30 years ago, it is a fairly cloudy crystal ball for
the long term implications of genetic engineering. I could make you
worry about the potential for dreadful new form of biological warfare
weapons, or indeed the trends in disease resistance to treatment.
However, the optimist in me looks towards an exciting future where
mankind is able to produce new kinds of beneficial products from the
science of biochemistry rather than physics. Certainly the
biotechnology industry has an exciting future with an almost infinite
set of possible products to develop for good or ill.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Computers</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">I suppose that in any look at key
technologies for the future, I must make some mention of how
computing will evolve. It is in any event an interesting illustration
of what is possible in a 30 year timescale. Think back to 1967 when
the tool of the engineer was a slide rule and physicists still used 5
figure logarithms. Computers existed but required batch processing
and cost a great deal. We have moved to a world where every aspect of
modern life is affected by the computer based on integrated circuits.
We can predict the growth of speed, memory, at the same time as size
and cost  continue to decrease. Moore's Law  seems to be understating
the rate of increase of computing power. However are we any better
able to say how the computer of 2027 will affect our lives than we
could see how it would be today? We certainly expect them to become
more available to people. This is both a cost and an interface issue.
Software development seems unable to keep up with hardware potential.
We shall certainly be looking for this balance to change. For
industry there is a need to improve software reliability and speed up
the process of software development. We must be looking towards
computers to develop computers.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Communication</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">While talking about the future of
computers, we must also consider the communication revolution. Again,
25 years ago the technology for the internet was in place and working
between a number of limited sites. Yet as far as I am aware, no-one
foresaw the implications until the internet had grown in its
uncontrolled fashion to be what it is today: a global low cost
communication system which is perhaps as significant as the printing
press, the telegraph and the radio were in their time. If we also
consider how satellites have enable worldwide communication
facilities, we can expect  to have every person in contact all of the
time. With access to information and opinion worldwide, there are
profound implications for the future of democracy and the way the
world runs and the way commerce operates.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Other areas</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">I warned you that in half an hour,
this could only be a glancing blow at the subject.  I would have
liked to talk about developments in materials science,
nanotechnology, medicine, manufacturing techniques,  media, personal
data recording, non-lethal warfare, space and the a million other
technological prospects. We will cover some doubtless in discussion,
but there are many that we have yet to realise will be significant.
That seems to me to be the excitement of living now.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Conclusion</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Like the long range weather
forecaster, I have tried to give you some feel for the large scale
effects which may shape the future. They will be political and
economic as well as technological. The most exciting new discovery
may not be marketable, and profits may come from the innovative
production of mature technologies which benefit from complementary
scientific advances. For industry, I have no doubt that you will have
to innovate or die, and that the competition is global and
instantaneous. Policy makers, whether in governments or companies
must understand technology if they are to make wise decisions. I
suppose that means that my final message must be that a sound
education in basic scientific disciplines is an essential for
everyone; and should not be looked upon as an extra for the
specialist. Whether that is achievable in the next 30 years is
possibly open to doubt.</FONT></P>
