<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Professional networks are a valuable addition to the portfolio of
programmes offered to Senior Members. Networks comprise Senior
Members in particular professional areas and provide opportunities
for meeting, sharing experience, seminars, contact lists, mentoring
and other arrangements. This may well become the most important
programme supported by the Office for members of the ASM.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>1996 saw the inauguration of the St Hilda's Law Network which is
formally constituted, run by an elected management committee,
offering a range of activities and a directory of members. Networks
for the Senior Members in government and business, medicine and the
media were inaugurated during 1998. An educators' network had its
first conference March 1999.</P>

<P>We also have a Career Information Service with Senior Members of
all ages willing to share personal career experience and information
with other Senior Members and with the JCR and MCR. The Office
administers the service.</P>

<P>If you wish to join one of the Networks, please contact the
Development Office. (ASM events of course provide further
opportunities for general networking.)</P>
