<P>The defence company chalets were full at Farnborough this year,
and confidence was booming. Eurofighter 2000 was displayed to
admiring crowds, and it took four hours to drive through the jams
from London on the public days. We have become used to military needs
stimulating research into new areas of technology, which then have
wider civil application. Yet military expenditure worldwide is in
steep decline. Even the United States, where the Gulf war acted as a
public showcase for their newest weapon systems, is increasingly
questioning the colossal investment in research for new weapons. The
impact of reduced defence research expenditure will have significant
economic, security and scientific implications.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>Civil Benefits</B></P>

<P>The 20th Century has been an extraordinary period in which the
research and development of new military systems has in turn
accelerated the pace of scientific advance to the great benefit of
purely civil activities. Direct government investment for the
commercial sector would never have been as great or as intense. It is
difficult to generate enthusiasm amongst the electorate for
investment in large particle accelerators to advance our knowledge
about fundamental particles. Only in some very particular scientific
fields is there the populist enthusiasm for the expenditure of
significant amounts of public money on scientific research. Medical
research, and its spin-offs in the biotechnology field, can raise
support with appeals to the electorate's fears of illness or early
death. Expensive space projects, such as putting a man on the moon,
can be hyped as surrogate wars between opposing ideologies. Much of
today's everyday technology has in some way benefited from investment
in military research, and the pressure for early development.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In the field of transportation, the work on aircraft design and
production techniques was accelerated by a strategic importance in
both World Wars. The development of the jet engine has transformed
civil aviation, but has also moved into shipping, trains, and power
generation. Radar, after its development from an interesting
scientific curiosity to a war-winning technology, is a universal aid
in the air and at sea. Military work on missiles has given the
enabling technology for the commercial exploitation of space. Modern
communications without satellites would be very limited. The
accelerated work on the physics and engineering of the atomic bomb,
gave the world atomic power. Computing techniques were developed for
decoding purposes, and the space programme brought together a need
for greater computing power with minimum weight and power
requirements. A military desire to produce nuclear attack proof data
links spawned the Internet . A need for precise military navigational
information has led to the wonder of the Global Positioning System
(GPS) available to every yachtsman.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The list of pure and applied research areas which have moved
rapidly from military to commercial use is impressive. In many cases,
this has happened despite the wishes of the military. GPS is one
example. It is provided by a constellation of satellites which can
give global coverage for its three-dimensional triangulation system.
With a handheld receiver, a soldier can know exactly where he is, and
receive pinpoint directions to his destination. A combat aircraft can
navigate silently to its target, release its weapons from a known
position over the earth's surface, and use the GPS system to guide
the weapon to its target. In the past, navigational aids which could
assist an enemy were closely controlled in times of war. But, like
the Internet, GPS is becoming a part of the civilian national
infrastructure. Attempts to provide degraded GPS information for
civilian purposes have been foiled by civil research into optimising
the information available from the constellation of satellites. Once
the commercial market begins to exploit the military research and
development, control is very difficult.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>Changing Relationship</B></P>

<P>The question now is whether this largely benevolent relationship
of public money being invested in military research, which initially
provides greater security, and subsequently triggers new commercial
developments is set to continue. The spurts of military research and
development came from the pressures of the two World Wars and that of
the Cold War. The arms race was sustained by the fear - and hope - of
critical scientific breakthrough. In the latter days of the Cold War,
there were already indications of an emerging problem in investment
in ever better technology. The real cost of each unit of combat power
was rising in some cases exponentially. While the capability of each
tank, ship, submarine or aircraft was improving, their numbers were
set to decline through costs. Even the United States, was revising
its front line downwards. To an extent, worries about this phenomenon
could be offset by a hope that the new smaller numbers would pack a
more effective punch. But smaller numbers also meant higher relative
overhead costs both in production and operation. While we have seen a
tumbling of commercial electronic technology prices as a capability
has doubled every 18 months, military technology was being applied to
ever smaller numbers at increasing cost.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>Prolonged Development </B></P>

<P>The pace of technological development was also providing another
challenge for the designers of weapons. Freezing requirements to
expedite production meant that latest developments could not be
incorporated. Repeatedly changing requirements to benefit from the
newest techniques increased costs and delayed production. Weapon
systems may take from 10 to 20 years to come into service from first
conception; and they are likely to stay in service for 25 years or
more. Compare this with the commercial world: if a manager were asked
to order an office computer system today, to be delivered in 2010
which would have to last until 2035, he would think it madness. Yet
it is a much more complex problem that the military requirements
officer is trying to solve. He wants a weapon system, which will
include many technologies (certainly with a high dependence on
computing power) to be used in a security context which is itself
uncertain. All this against timescales that are at least as difficult
as the office computer example. This problem of the procurement
timescale being so long compared with the technological innovation
timescale is not new, but it has grown worse, and the operational
scenario is now much more uncertain.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>To the casual observer, these problems may not be immediately
apparent. The impressive technology used in the Gulf War gave
reassurance that the United States was producing the key technologies
to win modern wars. The revealing of the Stealth fighter showed that
technological surprise was still possible. Yet the ancient B-52 was
also a necessary part of the Gulf War, with its ability to drop large
quantities of bombs. In any event, the technologies of the Gulf War
were the products of the Cold War. They had been conceived, funded
and developed as a part of the contest with "The Evil Empire". From
1979 to 1985, NATO encouraged, with some success, its member states
to increase their defence spending at a rate of 3% per annum in real
terms. The UK achieved this at a time of economic difficulty, and
military research, development and ultimately production benefited.
Those days are now past, but we will continue to see for some time
the emergence of developments that started in the 1980's. In some
cases they will be appropriate for the new tasks in the post-Cold War
era, in others they will require modification or cancellation.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>The Upgrade Route</B></P>

<P>This analysis suggests that the Defence sector is less likely to
be a source of major innovation in the future. Significant amounts of
money will continue to be spent on armed forces, but the aim is more
likely to be the preservation of existing capability than the
development of radically new systems. Recent equipment purchasing
announcements for the United Kingdom indicate that evolution rather
than revolution is the key. Aircraft systems are always described as
the area which depends most on high technology. The mid-life update
of the Tornados will mean that the aircraft,which was developed in
the early 1970's is now expected to have a new lease of life from
1998 onwards taking it towards its half century. The world's first
jet airliner, the Comet, was used as the airframe of the UK's
maritime patrol aircraft when it was developed in the mid 1960's. The
announcement this summer that the new maritime patrol aircraft will
be an updated Nimrod will mean that the Comet will certainly see 75
years service, and perhaps more. The Hercules transport aircraft was
conceived in the early 1950s, and the updated model will be delivered
to the UK in 1998.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>None of this is to suggest that the UK is procuring out of date
equipment. It is an illustration of the widespread acceptance that
the upgrade route has many attractions over the innovative route.
Development risk can be reduced, support infrastructure can be
retained, and known shortcomings can be corrected. We have moved from
the immediate post-War days when it was possible to design and
develop the Victor, Valiant and Vulcan as different solutions to the
same requirement for a strategic bomber. The Tornado became a single
solution to the three different requirements of bomber, fighter and
reconnaissance, and was a multinational undertaking. The only new UK
military aircraft in development is the Eurofighter 2000 which is
again both multi-national and multi-role. It has also used
cost-effectiveness as a design driver to a much greater extent than
ever before. The defence establishment has realised that the
ever-rising real unit cost of each new generation of combat aircraft
could not continue. Even so, the project has had some difficult times
and will arrive much later than had been originally hoped.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>US Approach</B></P>

<P>The alternative to updating old equipment, or joining with other
nations to develop new equipment, is to buy defence equipment off the
shelf. That shelf is rapidly narrowing down to the United States for
the most modern technology. It is true that US still has the
resources for innovative defence research and development and major
projects. The per capita annual defence expenditure in the US of
$1048 is almost twice that in the UK, and in absolute terms dwarfs
all other countries. But the likelihood is that, without a major
threat to US national interests, an investment pattern similar to
that in Europe will emerge. Already the rationalisation of bases has
started. There are continuing signs of Congressional unease with the
big spending high technology projects. Multiple solutions to single
requirements are no longer the norm. The process will take some time
to work through, but the days of projects on the scale of the B2
bomber may be over. A useful indicator will be the approach taken in
the next few years over the work on ballistic missile defence
systems. This is a potentially very expensive investment, it is a new
capability, it will be a major technology driver and it has some
political attractions. It may however be a project too much for even
the US Defence budget.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>Industrial Opportunities</B></P>

<P>If governments, including the US in due course, are moving away
from introducing new generations of military equipment towards
updating equipment already in service, what does this mean for the
Defence industries and for the research community? For industry,
there is a tremendous advantage if they have provided the current
inventory. Updating your own equipment is much easier, and cheaper,
than updating another manufacturer's system, and further orders are
likely to arise. This makes it even more important to secure the
initial provision of new equipment whenever the opportunity arises.
The design of such equipment is likely to appeal even more if it has
obvious scope for progressive updating. Companies will be able to
exploit the market for evolutionary improvements in capability. This
should be a much more reliable and lower risk activity than the
gamble on major innovative projects. It will also allow commercial
technologies to be exploited in shorter timescales. For armed forces,
the regular upgrading of their equipment has many advantages over the
step change effect of re-equipping. Training regimes continue with
little change, current support structures do not need expensive
redevelopment, and there is a higher probability of equipment being
reasonably up to date at all times.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>Research Priorities</B></P>

<P>For the defence research community, the move away from major
innovative projects to a system of incremental upgrading, coupled
with a significant reduction in resources, will require some hard
choices. At its most austere, government funded defence research may
do little more than retain an intelligent customer capability. This
would be unfortunate as there will be a continuing role for defence
research into new threats. We are likely to see the emergence of
threats from new forms of genetically engineered biological warfare
agents. It is unlikely that incremental advances in current chemical
and biological defences will be sufficient in this field. However the
research for effective counter-measures will undoubtedly have some
benefits to medical research, and may prove a very cost effective
area for work. Similarly, the increasing dependence on information
connectivity has already opened up new vulnerabilities for advanced
societies. Research into security and defensive techniques for
information systems will be needed for both national security and
commercial reasons.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The world changed after the Berlin Wall fell, and we have seen
significant changes to national defence policies. The trend towards
retaining weapon systems for longer periods before replacement is now
recognised, and the virtues of incremental updates in system
capabilities will be universally exploited. This will require a
different approach from manufacturers and the research community.
While there will be less cash to spend, there will still be important
opportunities and difficult choices.</P>
