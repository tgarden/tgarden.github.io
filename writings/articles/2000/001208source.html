<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Relations between the EU and NATO have shot
to the top of the press agenda at the Nice Summit. The issue centres
on the force planning arrangements for the EU's embryo Rapid Reaction
Force. The European governments agreed a year ago at their summit in
Helsinki to generate a capability to put together a force of up to
60,000 troops with air and sea support. This force should be
deployable at two month's notice and sustainable for up to one year.
At a meeting in Brussels last month, the EU member states pledged
their contributions to this force which is to be operational by 2003.
The force is designed to be useful for the so called Petersberg
Tasks. These do not include the defence of European territory: that
remains the task of NATO. The new force would be for humanitarian
tasks internationally, the rescue of European citizens and
peacekeeping. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Three possible arrangements are envisaged.
The first would be to use the force as part of a NATO led operation.
The second type would be an operation where NATO would contribute to
the force, but the EU would run the operation. The third would be a
purely EU operation, which did not involve NATO. In the early days of
discussion, this last requirement was described as an ability to
conduct autonomous operations. The word "autonomous" caused surprise
in some circles, and this was a word which the UK government appeared
to be happy with. The US welcomed the moves by Europe to get serious
over defence, but warned against the dangers of duplication with
NATO.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The issue that has blown up now is whether
the EU should establish its own planning arrangements in addition to
the NATO system. In this debate, Jacques Chirac is characterised in
the UK and the US as seeking to undermine NATO. This seems a little
unfair. For NATO led operations, NATO planning will be the norm. For
EU autonomous operations, it would seem entirely reasonable that the
EU does the planning. The United States may not enjoy the prospect of
being left out, but if they are not contributing to a particular
operation, they would have no right to be involved. This does not
presage the break up of NATO, it is just a sensible military
arrangement. Whatever reassurances Tony Blair may be giving to the US
and to Eurosceptics at home, the reality is that a European planning
organisation of some sort will have to develop over time.</FONT></P>
