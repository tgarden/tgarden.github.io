			<h3>MOD thinks about the Future</h3>
			<p>by Sir Timothy Garden</p>
		</div>
		<p>The Defence White papers may be getting thinner and less frequent, but the MOD has just published a unique insight into its thinking about future policy. Never mind that &quot;The Future Strategic Context for Defence&quot; comes with a health warning which explains that it does not represent Government policy. This disclaimer may be necessary in such a speculative analysis of future trends, but the outside cover makes it clear that it is an official MOD publication. Running to more than 10,000 words of close type, it is a comprehensive survey of the broad strategic factors that may shape future security planning for the UK. </p>
		<p>The declared aim of the Strategic Context paper is to update the work that was done for the 1998 Strategic Defence Review, and extends the SDR&#146;s timescale from 2015 out to 2030. This is a challenging undertaking, and the authors recognise the fact they will inevitably be proved wrong by events. What they are trying to achieve is some insight into the broad generic trends that may shape our futures.</p>
		<p>The paper breaks the problem down into seven broad areas of interest. The first is what they define as the physical dimension, and it includes the environment, global  resources, population, disease and urbanisation. Global warming is recognised (perhaps for the first time in a government publication) as an urgent security issue. This message is obviously getting through to all departments given Tony Blair's coupling last week of the environment and proliferation as the two most important security issues in the world today. The paragraph on infectious diseases recognises that AIDS in Africa is a global security problem - what a surprising, yet encouraging, statement to find in an MOD document. The physical dimension is followed by the technological. A mix of evolutionary technological developments with some that verge on science fiction gives something for everyone.</p>
		<p> Next comes the economic dimension in which an optimistic minimum of 3% global growth rate is assumed. This is the least satisfactory section of the whole paper, and its brevity suggests that the authors realise this. There is no analysis about the rising costs of military power. While there are statements about competing pressures for public expenditure, the continuing rise in defence costs receives no mention at all. It appears that even in such a free speaking document, the realities of declining capabilities, even with level funding, cannot be addressed. If the economics facts of life are given short shrift, plenty of space is made available to address the social dimension in general and public relations in particular. A cynic might think that the MOD's Corporate Communications department (from where you can order your copy) were doing some special pleading.</p>
		<p>International law and ethical considerations are grouped within a section on the future of the legal dimension. Within this discussion, the authors identify such issues as defence exports policy. This is picked up later in surprisingly strong language when the paper recommends greater care will be needed in the arms sales area.The political dimension covers the future of NATO, the EU, US, Russia and China. It concludes that no conventional military threats to the UK are likely to emerge in the period to 2030. Before deciding that this is reason enough to wind up the British military, the threats and challenges of international commitments, terrorism and asymmetric warfare are covered. International crime is rightly identified as of increasing concern as a security matter.</p>
		<p>The seventh and last of the dimensions to be analysed is that of the military. Types of warfare, nature of threats, the role of arms control and the problems of personnel are each covered. Again the cost dimension is almost completely ignored. The final summary makes a compelling case for the UK Government to ensure that a competent and effective military organisation is available for the next 30 years. It is unfortunate that the opportunity to ram home the cost implications was missed. The reader from other government departments will be left with a warm feeling that the MOD can cope on its current allocation of funds.</p>
		<p>When the MOD receives much criticism for its lack of transparency, and also sometimes for its lack of forward thinking, the ministry deserves our congratulations for the enlightened publication of this study. Perhaps, on a personal note, I should admit to be pleased to have had the opportunity to comment on an earlier draft last year. It is good to know that Geoff Hoon is following his predecessor's lead and seeking opinion in the wider academic community.</p>
