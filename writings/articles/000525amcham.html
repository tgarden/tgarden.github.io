<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Introduction</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"> Our security throughout Europe in the
traditional sense is now greater than at any time this century. I am
struck by how much this is accepted by European citizens, whereas
there seems to be a quite different feeling in the United States,
where security threats are seen as increasing. Yet we have the
paradox that European armed forces are being used individually or
collectively under a wide variety of banners more than ever before.
The  last decade has had them operating in the Gulf War, in the Iraq
no fly zones, in Rwanda, Somalia, Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo, East
Timor, Sierra Leone and a wide range of other continuing peacekepping
operations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The 1999 Kosovo air campaign brought
together all the political and military lessons that had been learned
in the post Cold War operations. The contributions from the European 
NATO nations which took part were varied, but all were overshadowed
by the US. Europe was shown to be surprisingly good at providing
political support for the operation, but incompetent at contributing
to the air campaign in a significant way. The difficulties in raising
ground force numbers, even for an operation in a relatively  benign
environment, suggested that the armies of  Europe were as badly
structured as those of the air forces. </FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Europe as a Strategic Power	</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Does any of this matter? It is sometimes
argued that there is no need to change the current arrangements for
security within Europe. NATO served the continent well throughout the
Cold War, and has reinvented itself to adapt to the security needs of
the post Cold War era. Indeed the enlargement of NATO, the new
strategic concept and the recognition of the needs of a European
Defence and Security Identity within NATO are all a part of a new
security structure for Europe. The question is whether this process
of development within the NATO structure is sufficient for the
future. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Europe is an economic power, but it is a
long way from being a strategic power.  For the 21st Century, it
seems inconceivable that a region which is as rich and populous as
the United States can expect to continue its foreign and security
policy on either an exclusively  national basis or only through
dependency on US charity in NATO. As we have seen from Bosnia and
Kosovo, Europe must shape its security strategy  always mindful of
how it will play in the US Congress. Looking to the longer term, NATO
remains vital (and perhaps more secure after Kosovo), but there is no
guarantee that it will remain in existence for ever. Had the Kosovo
operation ended in failure, the future utility of NATO would have
been very much in doubt. There will doubtless be other tests of
Alliance cohesion in the years ahead. A weak European element will
not help preserve the Alliance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Improving  European Capability</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The question  is how  to develop a
European Foreign and Security Policy which is underpinned by the
necessary diplomatic and military capability to implement it. We need
a design which maintains and supports NATO but gives us a European
capability to protect and promote European vital interests. The
arguments too often revolve around the institutional debates. The
linkages between NATO, WEU, and the EU, coupled with debates over
second and fourth pillars, do little to advance the military
capability available to Europe, and are unintelligible to most
outside the charmed circle. The institutional framework is very
important but it is nothing without the military and diplomatic
capability to underpin it. Too often the institutional debate
revolves around how to give Europe a greater voice in the deployment
of US assets. What needs to be addressed is how to provide more
European useful capability, and then how it should be organised in
both a NATO and an EU context.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">		The EU and the US have GDPs of almost
exactly the same size. Yet EU nations spend only just over half as
much on defence, and then share these smaller resources over twice as
many troops.   Current hopes for fixing the problems of European
defence capability currently centre on each nation modernising their
military on a national basis, and earmarking their more capable
forces for deployment. Each nation is expected to transform its
forces into rapidly deployable smaller more flexible units tailored
to peace enforcement. These forces would then be identified by the
process that stems from the Helsinki summit last year. While this
would certainly offer some extra resources for the types of operation
which are currently being undertaken, it would not greatly improve
the total defence capability that Europe obtains for its vast
expenditure of defence.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Ideally the development of the common
defence policy for the European Union, like the United Kingdom's
recent strategic defence review, should be foreign policy led. The
scale and the scope of the armed forces would be determined by the
objectives of foreign policy developed within the CFSP, while
ensuring that  members of the North Atlantic Alliance could meet
their NATO obligations.  The arrival of former Secretary General of
NATO, Javier Solana, as the High Representative for Foreign and
Security Policy in the EU  ought to make this easier.This would not
lead to any decoupling of European countries from their NATO
undertakings.  Nor should there be any duplication of the critical
contribution to military co-operation provided by NATO, namely its
command structures and headquarters, although certain developments of
double-hatting could take place.  The most effective way for the
members of the European Union to get more deployable forces for a
euro is by systematically developing economies of scales in the
support, training and operational management of their armed forces.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">On the political side progress has been
made, particularly through the changes in the UK stance since St Malo
in December 1998 and the work done subsequently culminating in
Helsinki in December 1999. Unfortunately, the politicians have gone
for the big ticket item of a deployable European force of 60,000
which can be sustained for 12 months with air and naval support. This
is unlikely to make any great improvement to the total of European
military effectiveness, and will certainly give many nations an
excuse to reduce their capability yet further.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Current Examples of Integration</FONT>
</H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	There are two approaches whereby
duplication between European armed forces could be eliminated  and
additional resources  made available for increased force
effectiveness.  One would be in the development of new common
capabilities, and the other is the development of pooled support and
logistic services.  An existing Alliance example of the first
approach is the common procurement and operation by fourteen allies
of the AWACS (airborne early warning and control) aircraft.  An
example of the second approach is the way that four Nordic countries
providing troops to IFOR/SFOR are supported by a common logistic
battalion.  The agreement by the Netherlands and Belgian navies to
develop common headquarters and support services for their fleets is
a hopeful sign that some European states have made a start to the
elimination of expensive duplication. Already this approach is
allowing greater military capability to be deployed. While the Dutch
and the Belgian planners would individually be reluctant to offer an
unlimited deployment of a frigate for operations, they can now
arrange to share a task with a roulement of forces between
themselves. The management of the force from a shared headquarters
results in a greater military capability at no extra cost.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The inefficiencies of the national
approach to defence within European states is widely recognised. Some
argue that the most effective way to tackle it is through common
procurement and perhaps greater integration of European defence
industries. Attempts at both elements have not always been successful
in the past. Recent experience in procurement of an Anglo-French
frigate shows how difficult it is to see such projects through
successfully. Moreover, the defence industries are reluctant to be
integrated by government fiat. They look to partnerships which
improve their shareholder value. This may in any case be a better
approach as it is likely to improve competition and hence value for
money. Nevertheless, there will be opportunities for sensible common
procurement where there is a widely shared common requirement, and it
makes sense to try to exploit these where it can reduce procurement
costs.  These opportunities would arise more often if nations move
towards a pooling of  military resources. Care needs to be taken
however that common requirements do not lead to poor value for money
procurement decisions taken on a political/industrial basis rather
than  a military capability basis.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Early Opportunities for Initiatives</FONT>
</H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	If we take a topical example: Europe needs
a much better air transport capability. UK decisions taken last week
may be good news for the European aerospace industry, but they do
little in the near term for EU deployability. To gain a quick
improvement in transport capability, the 10 EU nations who operate
over 150 C130 Hercules ought to pool their forces, close the excess
in bases, have a common maintenance and training organisation and
reduce the number of national headquarters staffs. Capability would
increase and costs reduce. These are the sorts of mergers that you in
industry understand. Unfortunately, militarys are unwilling to move
down this road. The development of a common European flight
refuelling service could also be examined. This might be made easier
if it were done on a commercial basis as is currently the plan for
the UK.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Eurofighter, already ordered by five
countries, could provide a trial for a number of these concepts.  If
Europe moved towards the American large airbase concept, we might
perhaps  imagine an operationally ready force of some 400
Eurofighters made up of 20 multinational squadrons distributed over
as few as five airbases.  In addition an operational training base on
a sixth airfield would be required.  The training base could also
provide a home for the European Union Eurofighter HQ. The operating
costs would be much less than the planned national arrangements, even
if the traditionally smaller European airbases were retained.   The
key to success would be the application of common training,
procedures and aircraft modification programmes.  By making each unit
truly multinational and by developing the overall common operational
policy through the EU HQ, the problems of  national divergence could
be eliminated.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	In the marine environment, one can
cumulate existing capacities and provide common supply services,
possibly leading to a rationalisation of the number of European naval
bases.  Fleet auxiliaries can be envisaged as developing a common
European service.  An early candidate as one of the European Force
Elements, would be a European mine counter measure service. The
principle could be applied to larger ships.  France, Italy, Spain and
the United Kingdom all wish to have some aircraft carrier capability;
could it be provided by a pooled carrier force thereby providing
savings in support and logistic chains, while also ensuring that a
viable force was available at all times?  A European led Combined
Joint Task Force in the maritime environment at present lacks a
satisfactory headquarters ship; one, or more, of these could be
acquired on a common basis.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	It would make sense to begin the approach
to land forces by looking at engineers, communications, transport,
police and medical services, which could provide the first common
programmes.  The wider field of logistic support could follow and an
early candidate would be the development of common IT systems for
logistics.  The question of outsourcing logistic and support services
is now under active consideration in a number of European countries. 
There would be economies through the  working out of common
specifications and the use of a limited number of common suppliers. 
Success in these areas would enable a subsequent application of the
approach of European Force Elements to artillery, armour and infantry
units.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	There are some force elements which are
provided jointly to&nbsp;all armed services.  Some of these, like
protection against nuclear, biological and chemical warfare, are
obvious candidates for common provision.  Others, such as
intelligence and mapping, are more difficult because of traditional
transatlantic patterns of co-operation, but not impossible. </FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The money thrown up by such
rationalisations could be used for those essential capabilities
identified at Helsinki such as intelligence, strategic lift, and
Command &amp; control structure.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Need for a European Defence
Budget</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	These examples suggest some practical
areas where the development of European Force Elements and common
support and logistic services could provide building blocks for the
strengthening of European defence capabilities. They would make more
effective use of European defence budgets through the removal of the
cost overhang of separate support systems. Valuable as such
individual initiatives would be, they would not by themselves
represent a coherent new security structure for  Europe. They would
however illustrate how significant improvements in effectiveness
could be achieved through merging particular national capabilities
and sharing common services.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	For this approach to become coherent, it
would be necessary to develop a planning and budgetary system at the
European level. The ultimate requirement would be for a European
Defence Budget. Under such a system EU members would provide either
defence capability or money as their contribution. This would have a
number of beneficial effects: not only would the free ride be
stopped, but nations would probably prefer to improve their military
capabilities rather than to contribute money to the employment and
industries of other nations. A virtuous circle of improved military
capability and effective European defence could be established. There
would be many problems in assessing the true worth of each
contribution, but the process would also make the planning and audit
at the European level more effective.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Reality or Fantasy?</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">While I can construct ways forward that
would give Europe much better capability for its defence spending,
the reality is likely to be much less exciting. For rationalisation
or pooling of capability to work, headquarters and bases must be
closed, senior staff officers pensioned off, and cozy organisations
dismembered. This results in enormous institutional antipathy to such
moves. The questions, which seem to me to be fairly spurious, about
sovereignty implications give another excuse for little to be done.
Pork barrel politics ensure that equipment spending remains
sub-optimal. It is a measure of how far Europe is from doing anything
significant that we all believe the Helsinki goals will be difficult.
A region that spends 170 Bn Euros on defence, has 2 million men in
uniform, must struggle to provide a 15 brigade deployable force. 
Those who advocate more spending by Europe on defence are even less
likely to have their hopes realised. In any event a Europe that
spends so ineffectively on defence would not be helped by just
wasting more money.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">There is a real danger that the Helsinki
goals will be used as an excuse by nations to do even less. ESDI will
founder, like so many of the previous initiatives, and NATO will be
weakened as a result.</FONT></P>
