<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Back in 1994, Malcolm Rifkind, the then
Defence Secretary, was faced with a familiar problem: too many
defence commitments and not enough money. He found a politically very
attractive answer to his problems by combining the government's
policy of outsourcing public sector activity with a rebalance of
military effort towards combat forces. Abandoning the usual defence
programme mechanisms, he established over 30 separate study teams
with Jonathan Aitken as the minister in charge. These teams of young
Turks were charged with cutting through the bureaucracy and coming up
with fast and radical methods of reducing support area costs. The
whole exercise went under the slogan of "Front Line First". Many of
the difficulties that are being experienced by the Services now stem
from elements of this ill judged defence review. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Just before the parliamentary recess, the
catastrophic state of military medical services burst into the public
domain. Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat spokesman, put a
series of questions on defence medical statistics to Dr Lewis Moonie,
the junior defence minister. The written answers reveal that military
medicine has virtually disappeared over a period of 5 years. Front
Line First had announced that there would be much greater integration
between the Services and the NHS and that savings of &#163;55M a year
were possible out of a 1994 budget of &#163;400M. 1000 medical posts
would disappear as would two out of the three then remaining military
hospitals. What was not to taken into account was the effect of such
drastic pruning on the viability of the remaining military medical
services. The 27 July 2000 Hansard replies gives the detail. For
example there are just two specialist burns consultants out of an
establishment of 10; 3 Accident &amp; Emergency consultants to fill
the 23 places; 9 orthopaedic surgeons for the 28 posts; 30
anaesthetists out of 120; and under half of the GP slots are filled.
Fewer than half of all  service personnel with hospital appointments
are seen within four weeks. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">To address this critical situation, the
government is having to offer medical pay incentives for retention,
and is establishing a new Centre for Defence Medicine in Birmingham.
The NHS cannot provide the specialist expertise for the treatment of
combat injuries. All of this is likely to exceed the predicted
savings of the Front Line First medical study. The MOD (or Treasury)
should hold an investigation into how its medical services forward
planning went so badly adrift.  There are many lessons to be learned
about the dangers of undermining critical capabilities for the sake
of hypothetical savings.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">There are other specialist manpower problems
looming on the horizon. The RAF is seriously undermanned in its fast
jet pilot requirement. Earlier in the year, the Air Member for
Personnel admitted to the Defence Select Committee that the position
would worsen over the next three years to be 135 pilots short out of
500. It looks as though a solution will be sought by turning the
flying training organisation into an outsourced activity, as well as
further reducing the number of operational squadrons. This will mean
that, unless commitments reduce, individual pilots will be deployed
more often and will have no option to spend a tour at home as a
flying instructor. The long term effect on retention is unlikely to
positive.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The army manpower problem continues to be
all pervasive. The shortfall of over 5000 is currently predicted to
be overcome in 5 year's time. However, this is a timescale well
beyond the horizon of any manpower planner. Retention remains the key
problem, as expensive experience bleeds away from the army. </FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The current government is well aware of the
problem that it is having to manage, but it may be less aware of why
the problem has arisen. Past decisions to achieve apparently good
savings in the defence budget have given rise to increased manpower
costs. There are some elements of a defence capability which are
essential: battlefield medical support and pilots are two of the more
obvious. Trimming force sizes to make savings can take one to a cliff
edge of viability surprisingly quickly. If savings are unavoidable,
it may be wiser to remove complete capabilities than to spread the
misery equally. In that way the critical components can be protected.
Politicians always tend to focus on equipment and industrial
concerns. It may be time for them to be more attentive to the long
term needs of their service personnel if they want to retain any
defence capability.</FONT></P>
