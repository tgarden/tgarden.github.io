<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Introduction</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">It is perhaps appropriate that I take over
the baton from Nigel Baldwin for this last section of your Air Power
day. I took over No 50 Squadron from him in 1979 just as the period
that I am to talk about began. I shall take a rather different
approach to the task as I have a period which will be much more
familiar to you. I shall certainly draw on the experiences of the
Royal Air Force during this period of great change, but I need also
to range more broadly. In particular, I shall want to develop a theme
of the growing singularity of the United States as the leader in air
power capability, and the implications of this for others.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The period since 1980 falls neatly into two
halves: the Cold War and the post Cold War. It also has three
operational milestones: the Falklands conflict, the Gulf War and the
Kosovo Air Campaign, and for the UK it was marked by three major
defence reviews. I shall also want to weave into this developments
both in technology and doctrine, and the effect of politics on all of
this. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Nott Review</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">We open the 80's with a Conservative
government under Margaret Thatcher and John Nott as Defence
Secretary. Nigel has told you of the 1957 Sandys review and its
horror for the RAF. John Nott has become a similar figure for the
Royal Navy. On arrival in office in 1979, the Conservative Government
brought forward the staged increase in pay for the Armed Forces, and
in their first White Paper reaffirmed the importance they attached to
Alliance membership and collective defence. They announced a
determination to replace the Polaris strategic deterrent, improve air
defence provisions for the UK (a focus which was to last throughout
the decade), a commitment to NATO longer-range theatre nuclear force
modernisation proposals, and protecting of the increasing defence
budget from cuts in government spending. In 1980, it was announced
that the Polaris submarine force would be progressively replaced in
the early 1990s by the Trident I weapon system which would be
purchased from the United States. By 1981, pressures on government
spending led to a reduction of &#163;200 million in the defence
budget. This resulted in abandoning plans for an extra air defence
squadron of Lightning aircraft, cancelling the development of the
Skyflash II air defence missile, and withdrawing a number of aircraft
from operational service earlier than originally planned. Measures
were taken to ensure that current expenditure in the defence budget
did not exceed preordained fixed values in any given year. </FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In 1981 the Nott review  reported. Having
restated its commitment to NATO, it then went on to explain some
concerns for the future. Even with the 3% real growth in defence
expenditure, the current force structures could not be maintained and
improved, and additionally,technological advance was changing the
balance of advantage between large costly platforms, such as aircraft
and surface ships, and the increasingly capable modern weapons. In
the light of this there had been 'a fresh and radical look at the
defence programme' to determine the roles and structure of forces
necessary.  The balance of advantage between expensive surface ships,
and the relatively less costly anti-shipping weapons, was seen to
have changed the optimum cost-effective maritime mix for the future.
The best balance could be achieved by enhancing both the maritime-air
and submarine effort, while reducing the size of the surface fleet
and the scale and sophistication of new ship building. Had these
plans come to fruition, the 59 destroyers and frigates would have
been reduced to about 50, while the 12 nuclear-propelled attack
submarines would have been increased to 17. New ships would also be
to simpler and cheaper designs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Falklands crisis of April 1982 came to a
government which was in the midst of directing its defence policy
ever closer to the European mainland.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Falklands</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Let me start where Nigel left with the
Falklands conflict. It sits slightly outside of the mainstream
strategic concerns of the period. Yet it was an important landmark.
Indeed, although we did not appreciate it at the time, some of the
lessons were to be applicable to the post Cold War conflicts of the
90's. It was also the last time in which the UK was to mount an
independent major operation without being supported by Allies. When
we look at the difficulties of coalition operations, the simplicity
of being in control of our own destiny, as we were in the Falklands
becomes apparent. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Professor Lawrence Freedman has described it
as:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">'A curiously
old-fashioned war. We have become used to wars of political
complexity and strategic confusion- Such modern dramas were underway
in the Middle East and Central America in 1982, compared with which
the Falklands War came and went like something from the Victorian
stage: a simple plot, small but well defined cast of characters, a
story in three acts with a clear beginning, middle and end, and a
straightforward conclusion that everybody could understand.'
</FONT></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">While such an analysis has a comfortable
academic ring to it, the student of this drama should not forget that
over one thousand men died in the short engagement, in order to
determine the future for the eighteen hundred inhabitants of these
remote islands.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The British public and parliament were
affronted by the invasion of the Falklands by the Argentine forces on
the morning of 2 April 1982. In the emergency session of parliament
on Saturday 3 April, the Prime Minister announced that: 'The
Government have now decided that a large task force will sale as soon
as all preparations are complete. HMS Invincible will be in the lead
and will leave port on Monday.' </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Thus, in the first phase of the operation,
the power projection necessary was seen publicly as a naval task,
with the expectation that embarked troops would provide land forces
for recapturing the islands should that prove necessary. What had air
power to offer during this initial phase?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000"> THE TASK FORCE SAILS SOUTH</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"> The Falkland Islands lie some 8,000 miles
from the UK mainland, while only some 400 miles from Argentina. The
nearest British territory with adequate port and airfield facilities
for use as a base was at Ascension Island, just at the halfway point
between the UK and the Falklands.  Compounding the difficulties of
such extended lines of communication, was the limitations of a force,
which was primarily orientated towards defence of the NATO region and
of the UK.The political imperative to get the task force sailing in
such a short time - the invasion took place on Friday 2 April 1982,
and the task force sailed on the Monday following - meant that much
of the detailed organisation depended on the support which would be
available from Ascension Island. Indeed the first aircraft of what
was to become a massive and continuing airlift-operation was
dispatched to Wideawake airfield on Ascension Island on 3 April. Air
transport as an instrument of military power is sometimes
undervalued- All armed forces are critically dependent on their
logistics support, and as military technology has improved this
dependence has become greater rather than less. While air transport
will never achieve the lift capability of surface methods, its speed
and range give it an irreplaceable role in all operations;
particularly those over extended lines of communication.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Ascension base expanded rapidly from 25
men to 800 personnel in three weeks, and peaked at some 1,400
including those in transit. C130 Hercules, taking eighteen hours to
fly from the UK bases, and VC10 transport aircraft brought men,
equipment and logistic support. For repositioning of payload,
extensive use was made of rotary wing assets. This lifeline,
propositioning equipment for the task force as it sailed south, and
subsequently keeping the flow of supplies going, was arguably an
element every bit as vital to success as the offensive operations. As
the task force travelled south of Ascension, the air bridge extended
to provide airborne supply drops to supplement the Royal Fleet
Auxiliary and Merchant Navy shipping as a method or urgent resupply.
Air transport offered an essential capability that suffered from its
inherent lift limitations. Thus merchant shipping transported 9,000
people and 100,000 tons of freight, while fixed wing aircraft moved
5,800 people and 6,600 tons of freight.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">If establishing a forward operating base was
critical, then ensuring its security was also vital. While the
Argentinean power projection capacity might appear limited, an
undefended airfield on Ascension Island would have been a lucrative
target for carrier-based aircraft, or even an Entebbe-style attack
using C130s. An early warning radar was rapidly installed on the
island's high point to provide good radar cover. Initially, Harrier
GR3 aircraft re-equipped from their ground attack role with AIM-9L
air defence missiles provided fighter support. When these were
deployed south to the Falklands, they were replaced by Phantom air
defence aircraft. The requirement to defend critical nodes in any
supply chain remains a planning consideration for all future
operations. For limited threats, economical solutions may be
available through multi-role tasking of air resources.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Before hostilities commence, the acquisition
of intelligence as to enemy intentions and force dispositions is an
area of major concern to any commander. Air reconnaissance provides
an important part of the overall intelligence picture. Yet again the
vast distances involved in this conflict-made such reconnaissance
difficult to mount. While the UK was fortunate had the Nimrod
maritime reconnaissance aircraft in its inventory, it was tailored to
a North Atlantic scenario. Before it could be used over the full area
of maritime interest, it needed to be fitted with an air-to-air
refuelling capability. It took just 21 days from the decision to
install the equipment to its operational deployment. Additionally an
offensive capability was added in the form of air-to-air missiles,
gravity bombs, the anti-shipping Harpoon missile and the Stingray
advance torpedo. In the interim, reconnaissance could be mounted
where possible by Nimrods, supplemented by suitably modified Victor
air-refuelling tanker aircraft. For the future, the need for extended
operation capabilities for maritime reconnaissance aircraft is
proven. Giving offensive capability to support aircraft where
possible is also a sound principle for contingency planning. </FONT>
</P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">THE TASK FORCE IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC</FONT>
</H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">On 30 April 1982 the Total Exclusion Zone
(TEZ) around the Falkland Islands came into effect, and the campaign
moved into its second phase. The task force was in place and its
continuing safety was a major concern for its commander. The threat
was from submarines, surface vessels and offensive air. The Royal
Navy was well practised in its anti-Submarine warfare role, and could
use its organic air assets (its Sea King helicopters), in their
normal operational role as part of the anti-submarine defensive
screen. Once the Argentinean cruiser, the General Belgrano, had been
sunk on  and the Argentinean navy withdrew to coastal waters, the
surface ship threat was much diminished. The major problem remaining
for the security of the force became the maintenance of control of
the airspace. Sea Harriers embarked on HMS Hermes and Invincible,
armed with guns and AIM-9L Sidewinder missiles were  small in number
and - previously unproven in combat, air defence force.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The 28 Sea Harriers flew over 1,500 combat
air patrol missions, with a 95% daily availability and 99% of planned
missions were flown. The Argentinians could field over 200 frontline
aircraft of varying capability. The British could not provide
airborne early warning cover, which made it prudent for the carrier
to operate well to the east of the Falklands, thus limiting the
patrol time of the Sea Harriers.  The analysis of dissimilar fighter
engagements, Sea Harrier v Mirage, is limited by the reluctance of
the Argentinians to engage the Sea Harriers after 1 May 1982. On that
day, 2 v 2 engagements, showed that the Mirage's early B-variant of
Sidewinder were easily avoided by the Sea Harriers. The combination
of manoeuvrability and the effectiveness of all aspect AIM-9L with
laser proximity fuzing gave no such opportunity to the Mirages when
Sea Harrier pilots positioned for attack. Two Mirages were downed and
another probably hit that day. By the end of the conflict Sea Harrier
had twenty confirmed kills and three probables and had sustained no
losses from air-to-air combat. The Government report on the lessons
learnt from the conflict drew the conclusion that:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	</FONT><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">'The
battle for air superiority was vital to the success of the
Campaign.'</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">No successful military operation can be
confined to purely defensive measures. The establishment of the TEZ
was also the signal for the commencement of offensive operations by
the British forces. On 1 May, the first attack against the
Argentinians on the Falklands Islands was undertaken by a Vulcan B2
bomber which dropped twenty-one 1,000 lb conventional bombs on the
airfield at Port Stanley. To mount this attack from Ascension island
had required an enormous effort. The Vulcan had celebrated its
twenty-fifth anniversary in service the previous year. Much of its
equipment dated from the Sixties, and its air-to-air refuelling
capability had not been used for many years. The refuelling system
was rapidly refurbished, the conventional bombing system reinstalled,
and crew training undertaken. A self-defence electronic counter
measures pod was fitted under one wing, and precision navigation
equipment for the eight thousand mile round trip was installed. On a
high-low-high profile attack, the Vulcan refuelled six times en route
to the target. This required a massive Victor tanker support
operation to provide the necessary cascade refuelling. The radar
bombing attack was made from ten thousand feet and achieved a cut of
the runway, as well as other damage to the airfield. Subsequent
Vulcan sorties were used against the airfield and on defence
suppression missions. Much discussion has ensued about the merits of
mounting such an effort to bomb an airfield at such extended ranges.
While the damage sustained was limited, the effect of showing Port
Stanley to be at risk meant that the Argentinians could not afford to
deploy their expensive air assets forward. Additionally, a capability
to attack the mainland had been demonstrated, and this undoubtedly
meant that a proportion of the Argentinean air defence effort had to
be directed towards defending possible main- land targets. Sea
Harriers needed to be conserved for their primary role of air
defence, and in any event their weapons could not penetrate the
runway so effectively.The Sea Harrier was supplemented by the arrival
of ten RAF Harrier GR3 aircraft, which have a primary role of
air-to-ground offensive missions. Four of these Harriers were
deployed by flying them down to the fleet from the United Kingdom to
Ascension Island and on for a deck landing at sea.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">AIR POWER AND THE LAND BATTLE</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The beach-head at San Carlos was established
by 3 Commando Brigade on 21 May, and General Menendez surrendered in
Port Stanley on 14 June. During that period, the requirements of
securing the task force continued unabated. Air operations were also
now necessary to:support the land battle by providing information,
tactical transport, air defence and offensive support.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Providing information for the land forces
through air reconnaissance should have been a major contribution to
the success of the operation, but it is not clear that this was the
case. Assets available included army and naval helicopters as well as
the Harrier force. The helicopters were vulnerable to ground fire,
and the Harriers lacked the appropriate support organisation for
tasking and processing information. As the Government's study
concluded:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">'Air
Reconnaissance. The absence of a dedicated overland air
reconnaissance capability was a handicap in the campaign, and the
resulting lack of precise information on enemy dispositions presented
an additional hazard to ground forces. We plan to improve our
tactical reconnaissance capability.' </FONT></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Given the nature of the terrain, the ground
forces were heavily dependent on helicopters for mobility. About two
hundred helicopters were deployed south, but the loss of the
container ship, Atlantic Conveyor, with three Chinooks and six Wessex
aboard, meant that there was an acute shortage of tactical transport.
A squadron of the anti-submarine warfare Sea Kings were reroled to
assist, and as was the case for all rotary wing assets, the sole
remaining Chinook flew at unprecedented rates of activity. Based at
Port San Carlos, this helicopter had to be operated and maintained
without its support equipment which had been lost with the other
Chinooks. In 150 flying hours it carried a total of 600 tons of
equipment  and 2,180 passengers. This started the slow change in UK
thinking about the importance of rotary assets.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Offensive support of the land forces, as
they moved across the islands, was an important air power task. For
the landings at San Carlos, the Harrier GR3s were armed with cluster
bombs, rockets, free fall and retarded 1,000 lb bombs, and 30 mm
canon. The assault on Darwin and Goose Green was again supported by
Harriers using cluster weapons. Once Goose Green had been recaptured,
the Harriers were tasked with attacking the defensive positions
around Port Stanley. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">As the final report stated:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">'The campaign
exposed the limitations of the traditional method of forward air
control of close air support operations. In the later stages laser
target marking from the ground was used, enabling laser guided bombs
to make direct hits on their targets.' </FONT></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Again it is interesting to see nearly two
decades on in the Kosovo air campaign that we were still lamenting
lack of precision weapons.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">I have spent some time on the Falklands
because it has passed into history, and I think many of the air power
lesson were slow to be implemented. The lack of a useful AEW
capability was slowed further by the debacle over the Nimrod AEW. 
There are also lessons about how easily we can be surprised, and how
air power assets can be turned round, used in unexpected ways, in
extraordinary short timescales and perhaps save the day. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The annual White Paper of April 1981 (just
one year before the conflict) has a single entry in the index against
The Falklands. When you look it up at para 419 it says:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">"419. The
Services have helped in various relief activities over the past year,
including assistance after floods in Belize; building projects in the
Falkland Islands; .........."</FONT></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The White Paper of March 1982 has no mention
of the Falkland Islands at all!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Defence expenditure was at 5% of GDP (twice
its current proportion),  and the Nimrod AEW was a major feature of
the forward equipment programme. It was cancelled at a cost of nearly
&#163;1 bn and E3A's re-ordered. So much for the prescience of White
papers and defence reviews. The air defence variant version of the
Tornado was ordered for the mid 80's. An aircraft more suited to Cold
War long range interception, than the agile needs of small wars.  The
need for support capability had been shown in the Falklands and
investment in tanking, transport and helicopters was increased in
this period.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">1980-1989 Cold War</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Falklands was taken as an aberration
from the main thrust of the Cold War demands. The Thatcher/Reagan
years of the 80s focused on the ever greater needs of systems to
defeat the Soviet Union. Reagan's 1983 call for a missile defence
system - Star Wars -was an indication of the American belief in
technological solutions to every defence problem. As important
perhaps was the extraordinary agreement by NATO to seek a 3% real
growth in defence budgets year on year. This was something which the
UK achieved for nearly 7 years between 1979 and 1985. The Tornado
GR1s began being delivered in 1979, and so the Vulcan last fling in
the Falklands saw its nuclear role replaced by Tornado. The first
Chinook Squadron formed in 1982. Nor were the weapon lessons from the
Falklands learned. The RAF focused on runway denial and area weapons
for its conventional capability rather than developing the precision
weapons which were available. Again the emphasis on low flying
tactics rather than electronic countermeasures and SEAD are themes of
the period. Investment was ploughed into air defence of the UK in the
mid 80's with upgrades to radars, SAMs, and AEW, with extra Phantoms,
air defence roles for Hawk trainers all to supplement the F2's. Most
of this investment was to be nugatory for the post Cold War period.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The next generation of air defence aircraft
was beyond a single European nation and the project definition for a
new European Fighter Aircraft, eventually to become
Eurofighter/Typhoon, was agreed in 1985. The first deliveries will
not be with us until 2002 - some 17 years between specification and
reality. Other collaborative projects were less successful. The value
of STOVL was recognised by the replacement of the Harriers with
AV8Bs. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The accelerating pace of CFE and arms
control, the fall of the Berlin Wall heralded the end of the Cold War
and the start of a new decade, which looked initially pretty bleak
for air power proponents.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Air Power Decade 1990 -2000 </FONT>
</H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The end of the Cold War left NATO with a
vast and expensive set of military forces, which had been practising
to fight a single campaign for over 40 years. The planning
assumptions for an all out war in Europe were relatively simple. The
enemy was well defined and consisted of the aggregate forces of the
Warsaw Pact. The exact locations, strengths of forces, tactics to be
used and phases of the war were studied by generations of soldiers.
The fall of the Berlin Wall, the unification of Germany, the demise
of the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union, all changed the strategic
landscape in Europe in little more than a 3 year period. NATO's
purpose was suddenly in question as nations scrambled to cash in on
the peace dividend. Yet in the event, the decade of the 90's has had
more diverse military action by the Western nations, under various
banners, than at any time previously. Kuwait, Iraq, Somalia, Rwanda,
Bosnia, Haiti, Albania, Kosovo and East Timor have seen western
military force deployed to less than benign environments. A new
doctrine for peace support operations has replaced the manuals on
flexible response in the military staff colleges of the
Alliance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">NATO nations raced to reduce their military
spending as the threat from the Soviet Union disappeared. There was
little agreement on the necessary level that would be needed in the
future. Indeed, there were predictions that, without the common
threat of the Warsaw Pact, defence would revert to minimum national
needs. In the UK, the government launched an early review of its
defence spending and in broad terms cut about one third of the front
line of each service. The fact that little money was saved was a
measure of how overheated the defence programme was at the time. The
RAF was generally reckoned to have come out of the Options review
process less damaged than the other two services. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Gulf War</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">However ( in an bizarre parallel with the
Nott/Falklands event) while the UK was carrying out the Tom King
Options review in August 1990, before most governments had completed
their post Cold War defence reappraisals, Iraq invaded Kuwait. This
was a clear breach of international law and was also in an area of
considerable economic interest to the major powers. The United
Nations imposed economic sanctions, intense diplomacy was undertaken,
and this was underpinned by the build up of a US-led military
coalition of 29 countries in the theatre. Following failure of
diplomatic solutions to the crisis, an air campaign (Operation Desert
Storm) was launched against Iraqi forces on 17 January 1991. Although
massive ground forces had been assembled nearby in Saudi Arabia, the
force commander, General Norman Schwarzkopf, continued a purely air
offensive operation for 6 weeks. Precision weapons were used
extensively against infrastructure targets. Attacks were orchestrated
with appropriate air defence systems, refuelling tanker aircraft and
a mix of offensive capabilities. Cruise missiles, with terrain
mapping navigation, were used in quantity. Massive area bombing was
used against armour in the desert. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">On the 24 February, Schwarzkopf assessed the
Iraq forces as sufficiently degraded to launch the ground campaign.
It was still assumed that there would be a difficult fight to free
Kuwait. In the event, the Iraqi forces were routed and Kuwait freed
in under 4 days. Air power advocates had found a new role. They
claimed that modern precision air systems in overwhelming numbers
would in future win wars, leaving ground forces the easier task of
moving in afterwards to secure territory. However, even in the Gulf,
it was a limited victory. Air operations of various kinds continued
against Iraq for the rest of the decade. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The key lesson from the Gulf War was that
the US was both quantitatively and qualitatively in a different
capability league from all the other nations involved. As the French
discovered to their annoyance, if you could not operate to US/NATO
procedures, then you were kept out of the action. In the air, it was
a war of offensive air operations, and these had to be conducted from
medium to high altitudes. Air defence fighters had little work to do.
The European nations had invested heavily in fighters to protect
themselves from the long range Russian bombers of the Cold War. For
their offensive operations, they had depended on low flying tactics
to improve their survivability against Warsaw Pact air defence
systems, while accepting that there would be a significant attrition
rate. In a war that was expected to last only days before going
nuclear, training and equipment were posited on achieving rapid
results. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Humanitarian Interventions</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Somalia reinforced the perception
internationally that the US was only prepared to remain engaged if
their troops were kept safe. The pre-dominance of airpower solutions
to international crises was underlined by the continuing air
operations over both Northern and Southern Iraq. Operation Provide
Comfort had successfully, through air operations, rescued the
displaced Kurds who had fled from their homes in Northern Iraq. It
was less clear that the results for the Marsh Arabs in the South were
as positive. While there was a need for some fighter capability to
police the air exclusion zones, it could be carried out as the
secondary role of either bomber or reconnaissance aircraft.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The sequence of events in Bosnia reinforced
the US view that offensive airpower could provide the necessary
coercion to bring recalcitrant leaders to the negotiating table. That
the history of the region up to the Dayton accord is considerably
more complex is unimportant. There is a widespread perception among
American decision makers that the threat and application of air
strikes was critical to obtaining Milosevic's agreement to the Dayton
proposals. Again, in this short air campaign, the world expected
precision attacks with no collateral damage and no losses to our own
side. When an airman was lost over hostile territory, combat search
and rescue effort became the over-riding priority. Operation Alba,
the response to the breakdown of law and order in Albania, showed
that there were crises which required a European coalition of the
willing response. In this case, it was clear that the mechanisms for
putting together such a coalition were imperfect, and that a
successful outcome was only possible because of the relatively benign
environment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The 1990s saw a series of operations, mainly
under UN auspices, to try to restore order in failing states around
the world. Air power had few answers to mass killings in civil wars
in Africa. Where agreements were achieved, such as in Bosnia, the
peace could only be maintained by the long term presence of
international ground forces. Yet the decade was to finish with a war
that was even more important to the air power dominance school of
thought. For the third time the Uk conducted a major defence review
(this time George Robertson's SDR) and found itself at war shortly
afterwards. </FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Kosovo &amp; SDR</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Having come to an uneasy settlement over
ethnic divisions in Bosnia, the focus moved to Kosovo. Serbia was
increasing its repression of the ethnic Albanian community in this
province; the UN and OSCE tried unsuccessfully to negotiate an
acceptable peace agreement. For the first time NATO nations agreed,
without a formal UN resolution, to use military means to solve a
growing humanitarian crisis within a sovereign state's boundaries.
The instrument of choice was explicitly solely air power. NATO
leaders, when they launched an air offensive on 24 March 1999 against
Serbian forces, ruled out an offensive ground campaign. Air power was
being used to bring the Serbian leadership back to the negotiating
table. Over 23,000 munitions were dropped in the ten weeks of
operations. From the 38,000 NATO missions flown, there was not a
single casualty to the alliance forces. On the other hand, a
combination of political constraints on targets, limited poor weather
capability and good Serbian defensive measures meant that the
military effectiveness of this prolonged air operation was limited.
Nevertheless a peace settlement was made in the June, before ground
operations became necessary. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The contributions from the 14 NATO nations
which took part were varied, but all were overshadowed by the US. For
example, the UK carried out 1618 of the total of 38,004 NATO sorties
flown, or just over 4%4 . 102 of these sorties were the Sea Harriers
doing little more than defending the small anti-submarine warfare
carrier that they are deployed on. 324 were air-to-air refuelling
aircraft aircraft mainly supporting the Tornados that operated from
their bases in Germany. The UK E3-D airborne early warning aircraft
clocked up 184 sorties. The sorties which mattered were those
carrying out offensive attacks, and here the total UK effort was in
the range 4% to 10% depending on the method of calculation (the lower
figure reflects munition numbers and the higher missions flown)5 ,
and we know that in many of these cases it was not possible to
release weapons. From 1008 RAF bombing sorties just 1011 weapons were
released. Of these three quarters were non-precision weapons. The
story is similar for the other non-US NATO air forces. The US
provided 70% of the total aircraft and 80% of the total weapons
delivered. Europe was shown to be good at providing political support
for the operation, but poorly equipped to contribute to an offensive
air campaign in an effective way. Again a large international force
was needed to police the settlement in Kosovo. Shortly afterwards,
Russia followed NATO's example of the use of air power in its rather
less surgical approach to quelling rebellion in Chechnya.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">While air power studies have concentrated on
the offensive operations in the Gulf and the Balkans, a growing need
for humanitarian intervention worldwide has had other implications.
Rapid response to sudden crises requires deployable forces. Nations
are restructuring their military capabilities to provide such forces
more easily. Strategic airlift and helicopter lift have in a much
quieter way contributed greatly to international responses to crises
in Africa and Asia. Planners in defence ministries around the world
finished the decade with a much clearer view of the need for the full
range of air power capabilities than they had had in 1990.</FONT>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Conclusion </FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The twentieth century was one of
extraordinary progress in the application of air power. Most air
power forecasters failed to make the right projections. This was
scarcely surprising as the technologies advanced rapidly, the
tactical implications were poorly understood and the strategic
context changed. Air power enthusiasts often overstated the
capabilities of their systems, and found it difficult to make their
case for resources in opposition to their land and maritime
colleagues. Successful air power nations needed a good technological
and industrial base, as well as institutional understanding of what
air power could offer. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The surges in practical military utilisation
of air power took place in fighting wars of the 20th century.
Theorising was extensive in the periods of peace, but was often based
on unjustified extrapolation of available data. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Currently, the United States has an
overwhelming military capability which is, to a large extent, based
on its modern air power forces. It can carry out precision offensive
operations on a world-wide basis from its home territory. It can
deliver conventional or nuclear weapons from aircraft or from
submarines. It also has the most advanced space and information
capabilities, and it outspends all other nations on military
research, procurement and deployment. Given this focus of air power,
it will be inevitably be a prime influence for all other nations,
when looking at their own forces. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Analysts argue whether the air campaign for
Kosovo has set a precedent which will mean many more such
humanitarian interventions. Some believe the political difficulties
of maintaining NATO cohesion mean that it will not be repeated, and
that only UN authorised operations will be possible. These are more
likely to be at the lower intensity end of the spectrum and thus be
less dependent on combat air power. There are still however areas
where serious conflict is possible. The division of the Korean
peninsular remains. India and Pakistan remain fiercely
confrontational over Kashmir, and are both nuclear capable. China has
the potential to cause difficulty, particularly over Taiwan. Russia
is not yet a stable market economy. Ethnic problems erupt without
warning, and sometimes with great ferocity. In any of the possible
scenarios, air power is almost certain to have a part to play.
However, the costs of air systems remain a problem for all
governments including the United States. There are signs that
regional co-operation at providing air capabilities may be the
pattern of the future. NATO nations clubbed together to procure an
expensive airborne early warning system in the past. European nations
are looking at how they might provide such capabilities as
intelligence satellites and strategic airlift on a co-operative
basis.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Air power has become an increasing
attractive option for western nations, which wish to minimise the
risk of casualties to their own forces. This will increase the
pressure for the developing air systems and tactics which keep the
operator out of harm's way. Unmanned air vehicles will provide some
solutions as will greater stand off range for weapon systems.
However, the increasing concern about unintended collateral damage
will ensure that the man or woman is kept firmly in the
decision-making loop.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Military air power began as a form of
support for armies and navies. It grew to have strategic influence on
its own. Many of the problems of development have come from the
division of labour between armies, navies and, latterly, air forces.
Recognising this, the most recent moves have been towards joint
military organisations, which are designed to makes most efficient
use of all resources. This comes just at the time when doctrine seems
to be moving more towards the independent use of air power for
serious operations.</FONT></P>
