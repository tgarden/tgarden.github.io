<P>Enthusiasts for air power have tended to overstate their case ever
since the Wright brothers first offered the prospect of taking
warfare into the third dimension. Armies had always sought the
advantage of the high ground and the power of long range weapons.
Aircraft could give both whenever required. Much has been written in
this century developing ideas for future air warfare by anticipating
new technology. Unfortunately the technologies rarely delivered the
capabilities predicted by their advocates; and as importantly the
cost of new air systems have been orders of magnitude greater than
the land battle weapons. Yet if the history of 20th Century warfare
teaches anything, it is that control of the air is vital for success.
Winston Churchill was aware of this from the earliest days, and
summed it up in 1949: "For good or ill, air mastery is today the
supreme expression of military power. And fleets and armies, however
necessary and important, must accept subordinate rank. This is a
memorable milestone in the march of man."</P>

<P>Given the changing balance in importance between the different
arms of the military, the need for air forces to carve out an
increasingly large slice of military spending, and the exaggeration
of air capabilities, it is scarcely surprising that air forces
throughout the world have had a difficult time with their sister
Services. John Gooch's collection of essays, by predominantly
American military academics, deals with these inter-Service
difficulties as much as with the theory and practice of air power. It
is an unusual mix of pieces with some new ground covered in a well
trodden field.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The chapter on Alexander de Seversky, who co-opted Disney to
explain air power to the world, is a fascinating story of the
obsessive proponent of the new method of warfare. French, German and
British air power development is all covered in the first half of the
book. An analysis of the Allied bombing campaign in World War 2 comes
to the conclusion that the differences between the USAAF precision
bombing and the RAF area bombing were more semantic than actual. The
final essay looks at a very specific question: how effective is the
strategic targeting of electric power systems? After looking at
examples from 1914 to 1991, it concludes that it will not achieve
national collapse single-handedly, but is a viable and useful option
for strategic air attack in the future. The more measured predictions
of where air power fits into a nation's joint operations is a good
sign that the theorists have learned some lessons from the past.</P>
