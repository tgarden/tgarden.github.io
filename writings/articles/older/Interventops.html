<H3><CENTER>The Roles of the Military in Intervention Operations
</CENTER></H3>

<ADDRESS><CENTER>Wilton Park 6 March 1997</CENTER></ADDRESS>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>One of the difficulties of joining a conference like this in the
middle is that I can only guess at what you have decided in the first
3 days. Your programme has given the opportunity to range over a
pretty broad definition of intervention in the developing world which
takes you from disaster relief to the high intensity end of the
fighting spectrum. I could just take that as an excuse to use my slot
on the roles of land sea and air  to give you the standard litany of
military capabilities, and an enjoinder to carry on much as before,
but with a bit less cash.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In some ways that approach has got us in the mess that we are all
in now. I would define that mess as an overstretched, under-resourced
military, which lacks any clear idea of what it is there for. And
here I am not talking parochially about Britain, I think it is true
of most of the forces that were on either side of the Cold War
confrontation. Certainly the armed forces have become the odd job
boys for sorting out all the world's problems as they arise. I shall
be using my time to say that I think nations need to be clear what it
is that they want to use their armed forces for, having made it
clear, they need to restructure and equip them appropriately, and
accept that they won't be able to do some of the things that they
used to like to think that could do.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>So forgive me if I rehearse a few of my prejudices about the sort
of security issues that we are going to be facing in the years ahead,
so that I can then give you my rationale for the roles for armed
forces and where the priorities are.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>There are a number of current and future security concerns for
States. All States have a concept that they define as their vital
national interest. This will certainly include the survival of the
State itself, but will also include the preservation of its
territorial integrity and the defence of its airspace and surrounding
waters. A threat to a vital national interest is one that must be
countered with the highest priority. The potential for war between
NATO and the Warsaw Pact represented a threat to each nation's vital
interests, and therefore considerable resources were devoted to
providing the wherewithal to reduce the risk of that conflict. India
and Pakistan, the Koreas, Taiwan, Israel are areas of the world which
feel this imperative. Many in Western Europe will take the view that
there is no such threat at present, but that there may be future
potential problems. The future of Russia will be a major factor in
this analysis. While Russia now has neither the capability (with the
exception of nuclear forces)  or inclination to pose a direct threat
to Western European nations, it is still of concern to its nearer
neighbours, and could remilitarise to pose a wider threat in the
future under certain circumstances. The future of China is also a
factor in the longer term. Some other countries, which are
potentially hostile to western liberal democracies, may be developing
a strategic delivery capability, which could provide the threat of
attack using weapons of mass destruction.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Territorial disputes remain, and are likely to become more intense
as environmental pressures increase. Water, fishing and minerals can
all lead to conflict.</P>

<P>Ethnic disputes are not new, but the growing acceptance  by the
international community of a philosophy of ethnic self-determination
is a potential cause for much new disputation. The experience gained
in the break up of Yugoslavia has shown that the strength of feeling
among ethnic groups can still lead to conflict which cannot be
ignored by neighbouring states. If this presages a development
towards more  ethnic groups seeking realignment of national
boundaries, and fragmentation of states, there will be no lack of
potential causes for conflict. Such bids for ethnic
self-determination can be a threat to the survival of the state.
However as the division of Czechoslovakia has shown, it is possible
for states to divide without conflict.</P>

<P> The emergence of China as an economic and military superpower
might have profound implications, but they are not yet clear. The
ASEAN countries will provide both economic competition and
opportunities, but are not likely to figure in direct security
concerns for a long time. Sub-Saharan Africa is an area where
instability and conflict remain alarmingly prevalent. The developed
world will have concerns for this region for both humanitarian and
historical reasons, but there is unlikely to be a  direct security
issue arising.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>A key question that is directly relevant to are thoughts on future
requirements for intervention is how the United States policy is
going to develop. As economic competition becomes greater, the world
seems to be forming into three competing regions: NAFTA, EU and
ASEAN. If this regionalisation of economic competition leads to trade
wars, then it is likely that the United States will be less willing
to provide costly support for areas which are not of direct interest.
This will have a direct effect on the military requirements of other
states.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Internal National Security Concerns</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In addition to the vital interests of  states, there will continue
to be a range of national security concerns to be taken into account.
They will be different for each nation, and even when they overlap,
they may be accorded different priorities. For example, in the UK
terrorism stemming from the Northern Ireland problem remains a major
national security concern. Other nations have a terrorist problems as
well, and all states can be at risk from both internal and external
terrorist activity.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The counter-terrorist requirements can absorb a considerable
proportion of a nation's defence resources. In Northern Ireland, a
fifth of the British Army are in place at any given time, and the
need for roulement of troops involves all of the army. In this
respect a national terrorism problem can have an indirect effect on a
nation's ability to contribute to wider intervention operations. For
the future, there are concerns within the international community
that extremist terrorist organisations may gain access to chemical,
biological or nuclear weapons which would have profound implications
on security. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The worldwide drug trade is a security issue, which is not a
directly military threat. It carries with both corruption and
criminality cultures, which can be difficult to eradicate. They can
lead to a breakdown in the rule of law, and put at risk democratic
government. In all these policing fields there are significant long
term national security problems for an increasing number of nations.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Intelligence operations did not cease with the end of the Cold
War. With the dependence on technological developments for economic
success, some states and companies will use espionage techniques
which have security implications. In particular, the massive increase
in the use of networked computer systems for data storage has  opened
up new vulnerabilities. As economies become even more dependent on
computer systems, states will need to pay attention to potential
information system threats.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The future is also uncertain as regards the  organisations which
will manage the military capability. NATO cannot stand still, but may
atrophy as it tries to adjust to the new requirements. The UN and
OSCE have roles to play, but are unlikely to be able top  co-ordinate
military intervention capability. </P>

<P>In order to deduce proposals for roles and priorities, it is
necessary to estimate both the risk associated with each threat, and
the potential danger that a given threat represents. For example,
there may only be a very low risk of a terrorist group acquiring a
nuclear weapon capability, but the severity of the danger associated
with such a threat means that nations will be prepared to give a high
priority to countermeasures. On the other hand, there is a high
probability of continuing civil unrest and war in Central Africa, but
the danger to western states from such instability  is minimal; and
the prospects for coherent action are correspondingly low. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Weapons of Mass Destruction</H3>

<P>The greatest danger to the future of western states would be from
an attack by weapons of mass destruction. A large scale attack could
at present be mounted by either China or Russia, but in each case
appears very unlikely. The retention of some US, French and British
nuclear  forces acts as some assurance that such a possibility could
be deterred. In the longer term, security can be further enhanced by
the reduction of weapons on all sides through arms control.. A
relatively limited missile attack by a hostile rogue state could also
be devastating. While such an action is perhaps also relatively
unlikely, the risks of such an occurrence are multiplied by the
number of potential hostile states. Countermeasures must include
strict controls on enabling technology, arms control verification
measures, conventional pre-emptive action, and nuclear deterrence. 
There are those who will argue that this threat is so great that it
merits investment in ballistic missile defences. This is unlikely to
be a common European perception, given the cost and the low
probability that effective defences could be fielded.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>To some, the most likely risk of attack by weapons of mass
destruction will come from future terrorists. They argue that both
biological and chemical weapons are relatively easy to make, and are
particularly effective as terror weapons. Nuclear weapons are
significantly more difficult to manufacture, but may be obtainable
from third party suppliers. Even a conventional explosive device
which used radioactive material as a contaminant would have a
powerful terror effect on populations. In the terrorist case,
deterrence is much more difficult to achieve. Control of materials
and technology for biological, chemical or nuclear weapons must be
achieved on an international basis. Intelligence, from all quarters,
must be pooled. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Major Conventional War</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>For the present Europe sees little risk of becoming embroiled in a
major conventional war. None of the European states show signs of
seriously wishing to used armed force to settle disputes between
them. Possible  differences, which could lead to armed conflict,
exist between Greece and Turkey, between various players around the
Former Republic of Yugoslavia, and in some of the regions of Russia.
But none of them, carry great risk of growing into a major conflict
provided that the international community, led by the United States,
continues to act as mediator. </P>

<P>Wars outside Europe</P>

<P>Europe has shown limited interest in the promotion of its
interests in the wider world by military means, and does not have a
common perception of particular threats at present. The Gulf war was
an interesting model for European participation in distant military
operations. Nations contributed in various ways ranging from
financial support through to full combat capabilities. Given the
disparate natures of European states, future operations are unlikely
to be any more coherent. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Possible major wars between North and South Korea or between India
and Pakistan are unlikely to stimulate a single European response,
and would not directly affect European security. Somewhat closer to
Europe, an Arab/Israeli conflict could cause great difficulty. The
Europeans might find themselves at variance with the United States in
terms of supporting the different actors. However, such a conflict
would not put European security directly at risk. Closer still, the
break up of the Former Republic of Yugoslavia and the war in Chechnya
have shown that fierce fighting is still possible nearby. However
such problems, while very bad in humanitarian terms, do not directly
undermine European security and shown no signs of growing into
something more widespread.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P> There seems therefore no great risk of widespread high intensity
conventional war affecting European security in the coming decade. A
thriving NATO, which may not be on offer, would ensure that what 
risk there was could be countered.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Terrorism</H3>

<P>Terrorism remains a constant threat to the security. That
terrorism may be internal, as in the case of ETA or IRA, or external
as in the case of the various factions spawned from Iran, Iraq and
the Middle East. They may be seeking to promote political, religious,
ethnic causes or even animal rights. They can be very small in number
and difficult for the state to penetrate effectively. This then is an
area where armed forces will be called upon to provide answers.</P>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Criminality</H3>

<P>It is possible that a greater risk to European security comes from
the breakdown of the rule of law rather than from the classic
military threat. The international nature of illegal drugs
distribution, coupled with extraordinarily large amounts of money,
has led to corruption and criminality becoming more widespread. An
absence of enforceable contract law in some formerly communist states
has also led to criminal protection systems, and associated Mafia
style organisations. If the rule of law is threatened in Europe, this
would be extremely serious for the future of democracy. Moving back
from a corrupt public service to a fair governmental system is very
difficult. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>There are no simple solutions to the problem of international
criminal organisations. Co-operative police work, an independent
judiciary, and accountable public service are all necessary. These
need to be  part of the criteria for membership of the EU, and states
need to be actively helped.  In this field the military has only a
limited effectiveness, and one is looking for better police
co-operation.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Environmental Problems</H3>

<P>In the timescale of a decade, it is perhaps unlikely that
environmental degradation will assume the significance of a risk to
national security. However, in the longer term there are a number of
risks, which need to be addressed within the next few years. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I have spent some time on all these issues because of course the
roles that the armed forces can play in each is different. If a
nation wishes to ensure against the possibility of a high intensity
war of national survival, it will want to keep  the full range of
land sea and air capabilities. It will wish them to be constantly
updated, and it will wish to know that it count on the contribution
of allies, or is able to do the job itself.  The US is the prime
example of a nation that sees itself in this way, and therefore has a
need for balanced forces with a strong warfighting capability. We
could look to other regions and identify similar considerations for
India or Israel or South Korea. If it is the national policy to
provide the broad spectrum of capabilities, then there is little that
I can usefully add about the particular needs for intervention
operations in the developing world.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The more interesting case is of course of those states which wish
to have some form of contribution to make to UN legitimised
operations, but as a part of a larger force. Here we can start 
looking at the sorts of capabilities which each of the arms can
provide. In almost every case from humanitarian, to peace
enforcement, the need will be for troops on the ground who can
operate without risk of casualties. The ground forces need to provide
security for themselves, for the NGOs, for the local government, for
dispute settlement, for health care and for the infinite number of
possible activities in intervention operations. If one starts from
this as a given you can build back the support that must come from
the other military capabilities. Mobility for supplies and for the
troops in theatre will usually be a key concern. Here heavy lift
helicopters become essential, with a role also for tactical transport
aircraft. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>We must then address the question of whether this operation is
taking place under benign or hostile conditions. If benign, the
infantry supported by specialist logistic support and air and sea
transport will probably be able to cope. There may be a need for air
reconnaissance to provide information in difficult terrain. If  the
intervention is in an area where hostile action is possible, the
considerations change markedly. As I am sure you have discussed, when
the intervention is not a question of national survival, the public
tolerance to own troop casualties is likely to be much reduced. It
will therefore be necessary to provide very considerable assurance of
sufficient defensive capability. Again, it is difficult to
generalise, but air defence will become important as perhaps will air
delivered (helicopter or fixed wing) offensive support.
Reconnaissance needs increase and will include the range of air
systems. In operations on the scale of the Gulf War, the sea supply
line needs protecting and one begins to be mounting the full spectrum
military capability required for limited war.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>So what does this mean for the priorities? And here it seems to me
that I need to use an example. We have a convenient one in the way
the UK has approached the problem, and with the prospect of a Defence
Review after the coming election. The UK is likely to want to
continue to be a significant player in UN operations. It has however
significantly reduced its capability since the end of the cold war
while trying to keep the full spread of high intensity warfighting
capabilities. As a result there is widely perceived overstretch of
troops, and a very limited capability to take on extra tasks. The NI
task, a counter-terrorist one, absorbs a significant part of the army
manpower, particularly when coupled to the requirements of Bosnia.
yet the only Cold War capability which is being dropped in the free
fall nuclear bomb, the WE 177, which means that the UK will have
Trident as the only element of its nuclear capability. If
intervention in the developing world were seen by a new government as
the key task for defence forces, what would that mean. Infantry and
their associated logistic support are already hard pressed. A
priority would need to go  to them - and that means more troops. They
would need the in theatre air  transport capability, and they would
need air and ground  defences for operations in a less than benign
environment. Some would argue that in the maritime field there is a
need for carrier support to provide air capability without the need
for local bases. In the context of intervention in the developing
world, I am not sure that one could make that a priority for a medium
power. The other important naval capability to be considered is that
of amphibiosity. Again, when one considers the total cost of a marine
landing capability, and its need for early reinforcement, this seems
a less useful capability for nations other than the US. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I am therefore developing a rather different set of priorities for
investment for a power like Britain in the future. If resources are
to continue to be constrained, and the intervention opportunities
will to an extent be optional, it might push towards a move away from
high intensity conflict capability and towards a more infantry and
specialist logistic centred force. Armour would disappear, and forces
would be scaled against two possibilities: requirements of the
national interest which must be done independently (NI and perhaps
nuclear), and those which can be done as part of an alliance
(preferably one which includes the united states). Air support will
be primarily in the reconnaissance, transport and air defence roles.
There is possibly an excess of offensive systems when one considers
the aircraft, helicopters, and submarine launched missiles. Looking
at maritime systems, mine clearing is likely to remain important, but
the cost of amphibious, submarine and carrier operations are unlikely
to make them the highest priorities. Certainly a look at the latest
round of equipment orders from the MOD seem to reflect more high
intensity conflict requirements than intervention in the developing
world.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>To ensure that I manage to stir up the debate, perhaps I can
finish by offering the though that we are not addressing the full
question. When looking at intervention, military options are not the
only ones. There is a larger question as to whether police are more
useful than military, whether defence resources would be better spent
on ngos, on diplomacy, on training or on economic development as a
different form of intervention. But that is the subject of another
talk. </P>
