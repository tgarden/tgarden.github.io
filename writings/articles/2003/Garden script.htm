<h1><span style='font-family:Times'>The Politics of Air Power<o:p></o:p></span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When I spoke to this conference last year,<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I talked about<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>airpower and politics. I shall not
repeat what I said then, but when we look at the part that air power has to
play in the modern world, we cannot separate it from the political dimension.
Air power is one part of the overall military capability of a nation, and that
military force is only provided to serve the security needs of the nation. I
want this year to focus more on the difficulties governments are having in
making the transition from the certainties of the role of military power in the
Cold War to the competing priorities of today. The importance of air power as
an enabler is determined by the tasks that governments want the military to do.
I will therefore spend a little time on the different perceptions about the
defence tasks of today and how to tackle them.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>In a rational world, the increased number of requirements
for military capability would be reflected in a parallel increase in public
expenditure on defence. Yet,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>perhaps with the partial exception of the United States (and even the US
is underfunding some important aspects),<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>no such increase in resources has been seen around the
world. This brings problems of priorities between tasks, and particular
problems in the field of air power where the investment is so costly. Many of
the speakers at this conference will be explaining why their particular air
power speciality is an enabler which multiplies the effectiveness of other
military investment. This is often true, but is a complex political argument to
put across.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In making political decisions about investment priorities,
the military argument can be lost in wider political considerations.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One area familiar to all the
audience will be the impact of defence industrial considerations. Indeed some
in the audience are doubtless masters of playing the national industrial card.
Important as industrial success may or may not be in national economic
terms,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>it is not necessarily
helpful in making best military judgements.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I shall therefore speak from an assumption that we are
trying to do is provide the best level of security to our citizens for the money
they pay in taxes on military capabilities. I shall leave others to argue why
this security should be reduced in order to support a national industrial base.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h1><span style='font-family:Times'>The Military Tasks<o:p></o:p></span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When we look at the military tasks for any modern nation,
they can be divided into four broad tasks: defence of its citizens on home
territory; warfighting abroad; securing international peace; and providing a
capability to deal with civil emergencies. You can carve these tasks up in
different ways, and in some circumstances the tasks will be overlapping and
inter-related. The reason that I want to use this division is that it allows us
to examine how priorities have changed between the tasks over time, and how
different nations place different emphasis on their relative importance. Having
done that, we can see where air power has an important enabling role to play.
Perhaps of even greater importance, we can identify those air power areas which
offer greatest benefit across more than one task, and thus become even more
attractive to focus investment plans on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h1><span style='font-family:Times'>Defence in the Cold War<o:p></o:p></span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To illustrate this let me first take some snapshotsof UK
Defence policy over the last 20 years. The 1982 White Paper is a collector's
item. Signed off by John Nott in March 1982, it does not even have an entry for
the Falklands in the index. It contains a one page loose insert from the
Defence Secretary explaining that the Falklands Conflict was evidence that we
could respond quickly to an unexpected crisis, but that our main concern
remained the threat to the UK from the Soviet Union. Then we spent the vast
majority of the defence budget on providing for the security of our citizens at
home through NATO. That gave us enough military capability to deploy to fight a
conventional military campaign against Argentina on the other side of the
globe. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Air power was the enabler that made it possible: air
transport, reconnaissance, strategic bombers, air-to-air refuelling,
helicopters and carrier borne air defence and air to ground capabilities. These
had all been provided for the primary threat to the UK and the West from the
Soviet Union. Even with a crisis arriving unexpectedly, we could cope. Both of
my other tasks, promoting international peace and dealing with civil problems,
were recognised in 1982. The White Paper then reinforced the message that
efforts &quot;Beyond the NATO area&quot; in what we would now call defence
diplomacy were important and expanding. The Services and the Community rated a
chapter to itself, which encompassed Northern Ireland and reports on such
events as replacing ambulancemen who were on an industrial dispute. Again these
tasks were possible within a defence budget of 4.9% of GDP, where 46% of the
budget was spent on equipment and just 20% on pay for the over 330,000
servicemen and women. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h1><span style='font-family:Times'>Defence in the 90s<o:p></o:p></span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Move on a decade to 1992. The Cold War is over, the Options
for Change defence review is being implemented, we have just fought another
unexpected conventional war: this time in the Gulf. The security of the UK is
still a concern, but is palpably less of a major worry to the government. The
cuts in front line capability reflected the lowering expectation of threat at
home. Yet the Gulf War had reminded us that we still might need the ability to
deploy a warfighting capability outside the NATO area. The air power lessons of
the Falklands were reinforced. To take on such tasks, which Governments wanted
to do, was only possible by having the enabling air power capabilities. But for
this war, there was a new perception. The remarkable success of the air
campaign, both in terms of effectiveness and low casualty rates for the allies,
made the political attractions of air power solution to crises that much
greater. But the dilemma of the cost of modern air power and its power was
beginning to bite. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By 1992, defence was down to 4.2% of GDP, equipment down to
37% of the budget, and the manpower down to just under 300,000. This still gave
enough leeway to send a major expeditionary force to rescue Kuwait, but of
course as part of a multinational alliance in which US air power was
pre-eminent. The traditional map of deployments of British forces showed 31
different global locations of forces on wider security tasks, and a further 33
major exercises of which more than a third were outside of Europe. A box essay
in the White Paper extolled the virtues of &quot;smaller but better&quot;. In
the airpower field this would mean the introduction of &quot;a new highly
capable Attack Helicopter towards the end of the decade&quot;. The paper also
offered the same optimistic timescale for the introduction into service of EFA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The 90's saw an acceleration of the process of change from
the primary task of defence of the UK through NATO and nuclear deterrence to
more focus on the taking military action overseas. Called by many academics
&quot;wars of choice&quot;, because they were not in the immediate national
interest necessarily. We had peacekeeping and/or warfighting in the Balkans Ð
in Bosnia, Kosovo and Macedonia. We went to East Timor and to Sierra Leone, we
expanded our work in defence diplomacy, we taught peace support doctrine in our
staff colleges. The Strategic Defence Review of 1998 packaged this new view of
the world together and looked for rapidly deployable expeditionary
capabilities, where again air power was the enabler. In George Robertson's
words &quot;we want to be a force for good&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Defence in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By 2002 we were down to 2.3% of GDP, that is half the figure
of 15 years earlier. The military were at the 200,000 mark (a third smaller
over 10 years), and equipment was back up to 44% of that budget. But new
thinking was again required, 11 September and its aftershocks had changed the
perception of threat. For the first time in a decade, we had an external threat
to our security. Defending the citizens against the threat from al-Qaeda is not
a war of choice, it is a primary duty of government. In the US this has been
reflected by the significant new resources made available for homeland
security, and to an extent also the enhanced programme for ballistic missile
defence. In the UK, the language of defence policy has changed as can be seen
in the New Chapter to the SDR published in mid 2002. The year on year decline
in defence cash has also been halted for the next 3 years, although 2003/06
sees the share of GDP down to 2.2%. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let me focus for a moment on the new balance between the
four military tasks that I started with. Defence of citizens at home, which was
the driver for defence planning in the Cold War, declined over the peacekeeping
90's, but should now be the major issue for any government. Capability to fight
wars abroad was assumed as being part and parcel of Cold War capacity, and
became the major driver of the SDR as a way of promoting security
internationally. Now its importance is tied to the war on terrorism, and more
topically perhaps to counter-proliferation and the long term threat to national
interests from states of concern. Peacekeeping seems to have fallen lower in
the public agenda, although the UK has made it clear that it is still signed up
to the good words in the SDR. There is however plenty of signs that as the
tasks multiply, it is the willingness to sustain the long term commitment
needed in peacekeeping which is at risk. Yet if we are to reduce instability,
which we now know produces threats at home, stabilising the Balkans,
Afghanistan and perhaps next Iraq will be important. Finally in the capability
to support demands from civil problems, we see home grown terrorism still a
potential problem, and the need for the military to sort out floods, foot and
mouth or the fire service remain. Yet of course that reduction in manpower
makes it all more difficult. Add to that the disbandment of the Cold War civil
defence structure and we have the need for considerable extra secuirty
investment in this area.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I fear we are very much stuck in the thinking of the 90's.
The paucity of resources, the shortage of people and the lengthening list of
defence equipment problems have placed us in the position of a rabbit frozen in
the headlights of an oncoming juggernaut. We are redefining the problem so that
our former defence plans can appear appropriate. It fills me with me enormous
regret that I am coming to the view that we need to look once more in a very
fundamental way at how we provide for our military requirements. This will
probably not happen until we, and perhaps our European allies suffer our own 11
September event, but it would be a brave forecaster who said that means that it
will not happen. While I have used the UK as my model for looking at the past two
decades, the story is paralleled in all the other European nations. The numbers
vary a bit, but not much. The message is the same.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So let me take you through the implications that I see for
western defence, if, as is possible, the threat from international terrorism of
the al-Qaeda scale becomes the central political concern. And what that means
as we look forward to air power as an enabler.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h1><span style='font-family:Times'>Future Wars Overseas<o:p></o:p></span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I shall start with the question of wars overseas. As usual,
our thinking tends to be centred on the most recent experience. Afghanistan was
a war overseas that was an appropriate response to a terror attack. It may be
that in the future there will be other Afghanistans Ð failing or anarchic
states that provide bases for international terrorists. There are unlikely to
be many. Indeed the experience of Afghanistan will have acted as an effective
example to failing states that thought they could get away with such
arrangements. Nevertheless, we must provide for this type of operation. In
virtually all cases, air power will be a major part of the operation. Failing
states are unlikely to be difficult air environments, and precision offensive
air power which can be brought on mobile targets quickly will be of greatest
utility. I am sure we shall hear much during this conference of the systems
which will be on offer to provide these capabilities. Intelligence assets are
also vital. In the end though ground operations are needed, and the tactical
air transport with supporting firepower will remain a key need.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If, as I suggest, future Afghanistans are few and far
between, what does that mean for our own planning. There will be an inclination
to leave the heavy work to the US given its significant lead in the necessary
systems. European nations will continue to feel that they can manage with
niche, or in some cases token capabilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But there are possibly other wars to be fought overseas. We
meet as the prospect of one such war looms large. The prospect of a war with
Iraq is not about the countering of al-Qaeda. It is the not infrequent
situation of an intransigent leader flouting international norms, and being
coerced by the threat of force into changing behaviour. Others will make
different justifications for a war, but the<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>UN SC has agreed to the threat of military force in order to
make Iraq carry out its disarmament commitments. In order to make such a
threat, the international community needs to have the ability to wage and win a
war. In threatening force over Kosovo, we ended up with NATO fighting an air
campaign; and we may end up with an international force carrying through the
threat in Iraq. Beyond Iraq, there are many possible international operations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is a growing realisation, that it is very
unsatisfactory to leave all these actions to the US. We worry if it looks as
though it may act on its own, but we have little leverage if we are unable to
provide the beef. For all of these operations, air power will be the first show
of resolve. Again the ability to bring large scale precision offensive air<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>power to bear in a timely way is
essential. Our capabilities will need to be able to operate with the US forces
from the start. This will mean significant investment as the US ramps up into
its new systems. For the UK, the New Chapter to the SDR focused<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>rightly on this issue, but there is
little indication on how it will be delivered within the current budget. For
the rest of Europe the prospects are by and large even worse. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h1><span style='font-family:Times'>Future Defence at Home<o:p></o:p></span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If we look at the other driver in future security needs, the
defence of home territory, it appears that only the US is taking the investment
needs seriously. Whether defences against ballistic missiles are the most
urgent requirements is arguable, but you have to be impressed by the scale of
resources going down that project. We will also see defences against cruise
missiles, which are a much more urgent threat, becoming an issue. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The other side of the coin is what role the military in
general, and air power in particular, will have in the wider field of what the
US calls homeland security. The air power aspects are likely to be relatively
limited. Currently, QRA air defence gives some public reassurance, although
little practical security. Perhaps more important is the role of aerial
intelligence systems. These have utility for counter-terrorism just as for war
fighting and peacekeeping. We see in the UK, what is currently a rather half
hearted use of the Reserves for home defence duties. This may need to become
more serious, and will then start to make another call on defence resources.
Military helicopter transport will be key to successful consequence management
of many major terrorist events. Given that we would need a pool ready to react,
this may mean an expansion is needed in this area of military activity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is much that needs to be done in terms of investment
in the non-military aspects of local emergency response. We were prepared to
invest a lot in civil defence in the Cold War, and we may come full circle in
this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h1><span style='font-family:Times'>Future Peace Support Operations<o:p></o:p></span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The stabilising operations around the world will still be
needed, particularly for post conflict situations. While these are not at the
cutting edge of air power technology, they must be considered in terms of
resources and balance of capabilities. We have not finished yet in the Balkans
or Afghanistan. We are now talking about the post-conflict requirements in
Iraq. None of these important tasks<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>are cost free, and emphasis on providing the necessary manpower for what
are labour intensive long term operations will reduce the money available for
transformation technologies and equipment at the warfighting end of the
spectrum.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h1><span style='font-family:Times'>Squaring the Circle<o:p></o:p></span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The list of key air power capabilities for these increasing
tasks is well known. Providing them within a useful timescale remains the
problem. When we look at the overall plan, we should assess what must be
provided nationally, what could be shared with others, and where we can rely on
allies or supranational bodies to provide an enabling capability for all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was involved in research work ahead of the Prague summit
to look at ways that NATO might work with the grain of Europe and the new
security needs to keep up with the new transformation initiatives in the US,
which General Jumper will talk about next. There is a real problem, and it is
not just about unwillingness to spend money on defence in Europe, or even about
the penny packeting of research and of capabilities Ð although both of those
are important. There is a growing divergence<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>of strategic approach between the mainland of Europe and the
US with the UK. The UK has made it clear that it wants to get aboard the
transformation technology train, but it will find it difficult to afford on its
own. While co-operative solutions would be possible with European partners,
they are less certain that this is the most important way to be going.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the threat is from al Qaeda
and asymmetric warfare, and the US will in any case provide the modern high
intensity warfare capabilities, they are reluctant to become bit players in the
new US strategic concept.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Prague was officially a great success, but as those who were
involved know, there is a lot of diplomatic papering over the cracks. The
proposal for the NATO Response Force was seen as one way to help European
members adopt the new US transformation technologies.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The measure is, in my view, unlikely to do much in that
respect, and will be very slow to act. If NATO is to remain relevant, it will
have to field capabilities as NATO that are important to the US. Currently only
NATO AWACs fits that bill. If Europeans are to field modern airpower enabling
capabilities, they are going to have to do it collectively. Only NATO AWACS
fits that description currently. The possibility of a NATO JSTARS is a real
hope that it may be possible to do something, but we need to see that sort of

able to operate with the most important air power provider, the USA.</p>
