			<h3>Rumsfeld Rules</h3>
			<p>by Sir Timothy Garden</p>
		</div>
		<div align="left">
			<p>The international public profile of US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld is perhaps now as great as any member of the Bush administration including the President. He manages to delight American domestic opinion with his homespun approach to grand strategy, and his unrepentant conservative views on how to handle US security problems. Abroad, his remarks can send a shudder through the delicate sensitivities of European ambassadors, anger the international NGOs, and cause fear in nations on his hit list. When the Bush administration was formed, there was some surprise at the arrival of a man who was a second time round Defense Secretary. He is no backwoodsman. Born in 1932, he was a Congressman by the age of 30. He resigned from Congress to serve as a member of the Nixon administration from 1969-72. He then went to be the US Ambassador to NATO for two years before returning to the Ford White House as Chief of Staff. In 1975 he became the youngest ever Secretary of Defense. Retiring with the outgoing Republican government, he then went into the business world. His return quarter of a century later to the Pentagon was to a world transformed from the Cold War. He had made it clear that he was much attached to the promise of technology, and in particular to the need for missile defences and new space based systems. <br>
				<br>
				From Europe, we have watched with interest the power play between Rumsfeld and Powell at the State Department. There is always a tension between the interests of the State Department and  the way that the Department of Defense sees the world. The Secretary of State post will usually be the more powerful and have the ear of the President. On top of this, General Colin Powell was a former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and had much more recent operational experience relevant to the new security situation. There were early indications that power relations might be different in the new Bush administration. The old Cold War warriors, Cheney as Vice-President, Rice as National Security Adviser and Rumsfeld at Defense were fellow spirits who had a different, more isolationist, outlook from the militarily cautious but internationalist Powell. While the coalition building after the attacks of 11 September was pushed and achieved through the efforts of Powell, the credit for the Afghanistan campaign has gone to Rumsfeld.<br>
				<br>
				Rumsfeld seems to talk to the media, and hence to the world, with no feeling that he needs to be diplomatic, inhibited or  constrained. His thinking is readily available. Over his long career he collected together a book of aphorisms entitled &quot;Rumsfeld's Rules&quot;, and they can be downloaded from the <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil">Defense Department website</a> . On relations with the Press  and others he suggests:</p>
		</div>
		<ul>
			<div align="left">
				<li> Know that the amount of criticism you receive may correlate somewhat to the amount of publicity you receive.
				<li>If you are not criticized, you may not be doing much.
				<li>Don&#146;t do or say things you would not like to see on the front page of The Washington Post.
				<li>The most underestimated risk for a politician is overexposure.
			</div>
		</ul>
		<div align="left">
			<p>He also offers help on problem solving in politics with:</p>
		</div>
		<ul>
			<div align="left">
				<li> Behold the turtle. He makes progress only when he sticks his neck out
				<li>For every human problem there is a solution that is simple, neat and wrong.
				<li>If a problem cannot be solved, enlarge it
				<li> If you think you have things under control, you&#146;re not going fast enough
				<li>In politics, every day is filled with numerous opportunities for serious error. Enjoy it.
			</div>
		</ul>
		<div align="left">
			<p>The international uproar over the treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay has largely arisen because of the Rumsfeld approach. The release of such inflammatory official photographs was a public relations gaffe, but was made much worse by Rumsfeld declaring his lack of concern for the captives' condition. He has found himself having to give a rather fuller explanation of how they are being treated broadly in line with the requirements of the Geneva Convention. While  Rumsfeld's Rules may explain some of his approaches, he may need to refresh himself on three others in his book:</p>
		</div>
		<ul>
			<div align="left">
				<li> The oil can is mightier than the sword. 
				<li>First law of holes: If you get in one, stop digging
				<li>Be able to resign. It will improve your value to the President and do wonders for your performance.
			</div>
		</ul>
		<div align="left">
			<p>Yet the President is now very dependent on his Defense Secretary to carry forward the war on terrorism, and the latest announcement of yet more money for defence will have strengthened Rumsfeld's position. In Washington, it looks as though Rumsfeld rules, and he will have considerable freedom to influence where American military power strikes next, whatever the views of Allies.</p>
