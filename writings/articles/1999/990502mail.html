<H3><CENTER>Chinese Embassy - The wrong target</CENTER></H3>

<P>No system is perfect. High tech aircraft, smart weapons and
expensively trained pilots, in action night and day over Serbia and
Kosovo, will make mistakes. Each pilot in Operation Allied Force
knows what is riding on his split second decision making. He must
avoid the guns and missiles trying to shoot him down. Flying at 500
mph, he must find his target and identify it positively, and then
ensure that his weapon system will strike that target and no other.
In the past 6 weeks, NATO has made some 5000 attacks in which perhaps
a dozen have caused unintended damage. No previous war has seen so
few errors. But in no previous war has getting it right been so
important. NATO is fighting to promote a humanitarian aim: the
stopping of ethnic cleansing and the return of the displaced people
to their homes in Kosovo. It needs to keep its 19 member states
agreed on the strategy, and it needs to gather wider international
support. If the refugees are to be returned to Kosovo, and provided
with food, shelter and security before winter comes, the conflict
must be resolved in the next few weeks. Only NATO forces are ready in
position to move rapidly into Kosovo and provide a safe environment
for its inhabitants. Other nations will contribute in what should
ideally be a United Nations combined effort.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Russia and China share with the US, France and Britain, the right
to veto United Nations decisions. Their support of NATO's aims in
this humanitarian effort is vital. Last week the diplomatic efforts
with Russia began to bear fruit. For the first time Russia showed
that it was prepared to endorse an armed force, along the lines of
the one in Bosnia, to secure the future of Kosovo. Reports were also
coming in of China adopting a more flexible line. By Saturday
morning, this all changed with the reports of the direct hits on the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. Somewhere in NATO someone had blundered.
The embassy building had been targeted in mistake for a warehouse
which stored weapons for the Serbian military. It appears that at
some earlier stage, the location of the Embassy had been entered into
the target list by mistake. Such human errors will continue to be a
feature of warfare - but one of such political significance could not
have been anticipated.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The NATO nations will need to work hard to rebuild relations with
China. Perhaps this is an opportunity to bring China into the
diplomatic discussions in the way that Russia has been increasingly
involved over recent weeks. If so, a tragic mistake might in the end
help to broker a successful outcome for Kosovo through the United
Nations. If the diplomatic process were to halt as a result of a
single target plotting error, the hundreds of thousands of desperate
Kosovo refugees would be the ultimate losers.</P>
