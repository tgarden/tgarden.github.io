			<p><font size="-1">The drumbeats of war are sounding ever louder. President Bush makes it clear that war is not inevitable; but he scarcely sounds as though he believes his own rhetoric. US forces have stepped up their deployment plans to the region. By the end of January, they will have around 130,000 people in uniform within striking distance of Iraq. This is beginning to approach the size of force, that would allow a serious full scale all arms attack on Iraq. Britain has announced the deployment of 30,000 troops: a far larger contribution than was generally expected. Any war is likely to start with a period of air operations, which would perhaps give another month to top up the rest of the ground forces. <br>
					<br>
					As we approach the crucial milestone of the inspectors' report to the Security Council on 27 January, the position of Europe is important. Of the 15 Security Council members, four are EU member states. The UK and France as permanent members with a veto have greatest influence, but Germany and Spain are significant players. The EU has taken a low key approach. Javier Solana has already made clear his preference for a further UN resolution before any military intervention in Iraq. As Greece took on the Presidency, Prime Minister Costas Simitis said that the EU would do everything possible to prevent war.<br>
					<br>
					NATO is on the sidelines. Doubtless the US would like to see a coherent alliance approach, which could give it legitimacy for action even without express UN authorisation. Despite US briefings of the North Atlantic Council, there is little sign of NATO being prepared to take a central role in any war. The US would like to see NATO defending Turkey from possible Iraqi counter-attacks, but even this is problematic.<br>
					<br>
					Among allies, only Britain seems to be making any serious preparations for taking part in a military operation in Iraq. The sailing of UK naval forces in early January attracted widespread publicity, but they were planned to progress slowly with a stop en route for training in the Mediterranean. Reserves have been called up and equipment modified for operations in Iraq. A small number of extra combat aircraft have been sent to the region.  The first serious commitment has come with the announcement on 20 January of the major deployment of ground forces. The 30,000 soldiers and marines could be ready for combat towards the end of February. This force represents just about every available British soldier. Prime Minister Tony Blair is encountering stiff resistance within the Labour party as well as more widely in the country. He appears to be expecting that a second UN resolution will authorise the use of force, and that will quiet the anti-war dissent in the country.<br>
					<br>
					In France some precautionary military preparations have been undertaken, but there is little sign of imminent deployments to the region. Germany finds itself in continuing difficulty over relations with the US, and also with significant domestic anti-war sentiment. It has made it clear that its troops will not be part of a coalition force against Iraq. The mixed messages from Chancellor Schroeder add to the confusion. He will allow the use of German bases by US forces, and also German personnel in any NATO AWACS aircraft defending Turkey. However, it is not clear that he will give Germany's support to a UN resolution, which authorises the use of force.  <br>
					<br>
					An interesting player in this crisis is Turkey. The new government has shown great reluctance to put at risk regional stability and its economy through support for a war in Iraq. Yet US pressure, and also internal Turkish military sentiment may make such independence unsustainable. The rest of Europe seems to be hoping that the problem will go away. Either there will be a new UN resolution specifically authorising military force, or the US and UK will go it alone. It is a time when there is a real need for a common European position, but it looks as though the traditional division between the anglo-saxons and continental Europe is about to be reinforced. None of this bodes well for NATO or the CFSP.</font></p>
