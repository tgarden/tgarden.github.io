<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Many British manufacturing industries have
declined or disappeared over the past half century. Yet one, the
manufacture of weapons, maintains an extraordinary preeminence. Since
the end of the Cold War,  the worldwide arms market has declined as
the international competition has increased; and yet Britain is
second only to the United States as an arms exporter. The defence
industries employ about 400,000 people of whom over a third are
directly dependent on export contracts. The total value of these
exports is of the order of &#163;5 billion per year. These are the
statistics which politicians and industrialists will quote whenever 
the morality of arms sales policy is questioned. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The thoughtful citizen should be concerned
about many aspects of this unique industry. We make drug dealing
illegal because of the destruction that addictive substances cause to
the individual and society. We regulate closely the tobacco industry
because its products reduce the life span of smokers. Yet we exult in
being a world leader in the production and export of weapons that are
designed to kill. Of course, the rationale is that weapons are
produced for defensive purposes: the right of self defence is
enshrined in the UN Charter. For many military forces this will be
true. We train and equip the British military to kill so that they
can defend themselves, their country and those nations with which we
are allied. The use of our troops is rightly subject to the closest
regulation, national law, European law and international law. One
might expect the export of arms to other countries to be subject to
similar considerations, particularly by a government that espouses an
ethical dimension to its foreign policy. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Mark Pythian, a Politics lecturer at
Wolverhampton University, has produced a deep and thoughtful analysis
of the politics behind the success that Britain has enjoyed in arms
sales. In doing so, he raises many questions about the ethics,
economics, legality, opportunity costs and institutional arrangements
that surround the defence industries. He shows how successive UK
governments, both Labour and Conservative have sought to stretch
policies to the limits to accommodate arms exports.  Harold Wilson
had publicly declared in 1963 that a future Labour Government would
ban all arms sales to South Africa, and immediately on assuming
office the following year instructed that all shipments of arms
should cease forthwith. He was then briefed by officials on the
potential loss of export earnings, the effect on British strategic
interests and the liability for export credit guarantees. By the
following month aircraft deliveries to South Africa were resumed.
Robin Cook had a similar change of heart over aircraft deliveries to
Indonesia.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">At least British weapons in South Africa
were not used against British forces. Argentina had been a regular
customer for British weapon systems since the 1950s. The military
coup in 1968 did not effect the deliveries of ships, missiles and
helicopters.  Indeed spare parts were delivered from Britain just 10
days before Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands. British troops
would find themselves facing British  (and French) weapons. Nor was
this lesson learned subsequently as the Scott Inquiry so clearly
demonstrated. Government guidelines were pushed to the limits to
provide military capabilities to Iraq either directly or through
third party countries in the 1980s. Again the poor British forces
found themselves at the wrong end of British made weaponry. </FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The book examines many other cases of
dubious exporting practice to places such as Chile, Brazil, Peru,
Iran, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Malaysia. Sometimes the need for
the weapons was questionable, and for some the final purpose was as
likely to be for internal repression as defence.  Rarely would the UK
government of the day see beyond the possibility of the hope for
export income. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Yet the evidence for the real economic
benefit from arms exports is very obscure. Pythian might have devoted
a little more of his book to this important subject. The reader will
piece together a confusing  picture of claimed export income and
possible hidden costs. The use of government backed guarantees meant
that we paid &#163;652 million  for Iraq to procure weapons to use
against us. In Malaysia, &#163;234 million of concessional loans for
the Pergau Dam project were arranged in parallel (but technically
separate) with aircraft, frigate and missile sales. Add to these
costs, the costs of running  the Defence Export Services Organisation
(DESO), fielding military attach&eacute;s as arms salesmen around the
world, and withdrawing frontline equipment from our forces when
needed to clinch a deal and the costs may be surprisingly high. We
provide no comparable support for any other industry.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The costs of promoting arms sales are not
just financial. Pythian points out the foreign policy costs. If a
lucrative arms deal is in the balance, the British government has a
history of tempering its foreign policy accordingly. Both Malaysia
and Saudi Arabia have made it clear on several occasions that
continuing business depends on uncritical relations. An adverse
British media comment may be enough to have them threaten to cancel
contracts. The presence in London of a Saudi dissident, Mohammed
al-Mas'ari, sparked such threats that the British government  ordered
the expulsion of this political refugee.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The arrangements for  controlling arms
exports are bizarre. DESO, which supports the defence industries, is
a part of the Ministry of Defence. Yet the MOD should be more
concerned about restricting arms sales abroad to potential
adversaries than promoting such deals. The Department of Trade and
Industry has overall control, and is primarily concerned about
supporting British manufacturers and exports. The Foreign Office and
the Department for International Development comment on proposals but
appear to have no veto, when a sale is not in line with foreign or
aid policy. Pythian advocates greater Foreign Office control and more
parliamentary transparency. I would argue that  the DESO (if it
should exist as a government organ at all) should move to the DTI
where the exporting lobby could be unified. MOD could then protect
Defence interests and the FCO could rule on the overall foreign
policy requirement.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Perhaps the most troubling thread which runs
through the whole book is the question of corruption. The arms
industry is peculiarly susceptible to corrupt practices. The sums of
money are enormous, and buying decisions are handled in secret by
relatively few people. The custom of paying commissions blurs the
distinctions between consultancy and bribery. It is ironic that
weapons, that are overtly sold to defend countries, may in the end
undermine their governments through the spread of corrupt practices.
The UK government needs to take a much fiercer approach to this
problem. It should only award domestic defence contracts to companies
who have put into place an acceptable and enforced corporate ethical
policy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">This review can only touch on the rich vein
of material that Pythian has quarried for his reader. It is a book
which deserves a wide audience beyond the political scientist. It is
rarely that such a well researched academic book is such a very good
read. Perhaps Robin Cook should curl up with it over Christmas. He
might feel moved again to put a little more ethics into Britain's
approach to arms sales.</FONT></P>
