<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Review of the Exploration Programme</H2>

<P><BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>Expenditure<BR>

</STRONG><BR>

RTZ-CRA's expenditure on exploration for the quarter ending 30
September 1996 was approximately US$60 million. This amount comprises
revenue and capital expenditures including the exploration programmes
in Irian Jaya via the partnership with Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp;
Gold.<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>Major Developments</STRONG><BR>

<STRONG><BR>

Pipeline (US)<BR>

</STRONG><BR>

Placer Dome, RTZ-CRA's partner in the Cortez joint venture, recently
announced plans to integrate the development of the South Pipeline
and Pipeline deposits. Pipeline is estimated to contain 4.3 million
ounces of gold, with South Pipeline adding a further 44 million
tonnes grading 1.75 grams per tonne or 2.5 million ounces. Commencing
in 1997, Pipeline / South Pipeline is expected to produce 440,000
ounces per year over 12 years at an average cash production cost of
US$152 per ounce.<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>Diavik diamond project (Canada)</STRONG><BR>

<BR>

Mining of the underground bulk sample at A-154 South is now complete.
CRA Diamonds determined an average figure of US$57 per carat for
diamonds valued to date (5,739 carats). Processing and valuation of
the bulk sample is expected to be completed by early 1997.<BR>

<BR>

Underground drill stations have been established, and deep
delineation drilling is underway in order to test the dimensions of
A-154 South and A-418 at depth. Mining of the 3000 tonne bulk sample
from A-418 was completed during the quarter. This material is being
stockpiled at the surface pending transportation to the processing
plant via the winter road. CRA Diamonds have valued the diamonds
recovered (247.5 carats) from large diameter core drilling of the
pipe at an average of US$64 per carat.<BR>

<BR>

Processing of large diameter drilling core from A-154 North (8 holes)
and A-21 (1 hole) was completed, yielding approximate grades of 2.2
carats per tonne and 3.1 carats per tonne, respectively. <CITE><BR>

</CITE><BR>

<STRONG>Freeport (Indonesia)</STRONG><BR>

<BR>

Underground drilling continued from underground sites in the Amole
tunnel and the new northwest trending Kucing Liar / Lembah Tembaga
drift, targeting Kucing Liar mineralisation in Block A. 22 holes were
completed, and confirmed the continuity of skarn mineralisation over
500 metres of the 1500 metres length of known mineralisation.
Preliminary results suggest an average thickness for this zone in
excess of 100 metres grading 2 per cent copper equivalent. The best
results were returned from drillhole KL 16-1 which intersected 401
metres (not a true thickness) grading 2 per cent copper and 1.9 grams
per tonne gold. Exploration continued at other targets, which include
Big Gossan, Lembah Tembaga and Wabu.<BR>

<STRONG>Century (Australia)</STRONG><BR>

<BR>

Negotiations under the provisions of the Native Title Act have begun.
As required, the Queensland government has initiated meetings with
the claimants, and Century Zinc has invited the claimants to make
submissions. The claimants have invited the Native Title Tribunal to
mediate.<BR>

<BR>

Reconnaissance exploration continued within a 10 kilometre radius of
the Century deposit. A number of targets were defined for further
follow up.<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>Las Cruces (Spain)</STRONG><BR>

<BR>

Infill drilling to further define the high grade massive sulphide
resource continued, with additional drilling allocated to finding
extensions to the deposit as well as to obtain core for metallurgical
tests. The deposit contains a copper resource grading approximately 6
per cent copper, in addition to other copper, lead, zinc, gold and
silver mineralisation. The total geological resource for all types of
mineralisation exceeds 20 million tonnes. Approximately 150 holes
have been drilled on the site to date. Planning has commenced for an
underground bulk sampling programme. Preliminary engineering,
metallurgical, hydrological and environmental studies have
commenced.<BR>

<STRONG><BR>

Other Projects</STRONG><BR>

<BR>

Burunga Pacific Oil &amp; Gas Pty Limited (RTZ-CRA 100%) reached
an<BR>

(Gas Australia) agreement with Oil Company of Australia Limited
(OCA),<BR>

whereby OCA will farm into the Peat coalbed methane project in<BR>

southeast Queensland. RTZ-CRA will retain a 50 per cent equity<BR>

after OCA has completed its agreed earn in programme.<BR>

Evaluation wells Peat 2,3 and 4, which exhibited flows as high as<BR>

70,000 cubic metres per day in earlier testing, remain shut at<BR>

present.<STRONG><BR>

</STRONG><BR>

Mokrsko The exploration license for Mokrsko has yet to be awarded,
and<BR>

(Gold-Czech Rep.) the licensing process is likely to take some
time.<BR>

<BR>

Sept-Iles An agreement has been reached with Virginia Gold Mines, and
(base metals- ts partners S.E.M Vior and Exploration Azimut with
regard to the Canada) area surrounding the Quebec Department of
Natural Resources' Lac Volant nickel - copper - cobalt discovery in
the Sept - Iles area, Quebec. The area, covering 800 square
kilometres, was previously closed to staking. Kennecott has the
option to earn a 50 per cent interest in properties staked within the
area, by making a cash payment of $300,000 and spending $2 million
over the next three years.<BR>

<BR>

Regional Exploration continues on the company's extensive land
positions in Australia, North and South America, Indonesia,
Philippines, Europe and southern Africa.<BR>

<BR>

In addition to existing diamond exploration programmes,RTZ- CRA owns
an approximate 18% interest in SouthernEra which conducts an active
worldwide diamond exploration programme including a new kimberlite
dyke discovery in South Africa.<BR>

<BR>

RTZ-CRA controls a substantial land position on the Kalimantan gold
belt which hosts the Kelian mine and other gold deposits. Exploration
is expected to commence once the COWs have been approved.<BR>

<BR>

Other programmes of interest include Llano Largo (gold- Ecuador),
Cachi Laguna (gold-Bolivia), Tapajos (gold-Brazil), Famatina
(gold-Argentina), Beitbridge (diamonds-Zimbabwe), Mt Sheila (iron
ore-Australia), Westmoreland (uranium- Australia) and Araguaia (base
metals-Brazil).<BR>
