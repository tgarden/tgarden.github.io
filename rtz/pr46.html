<P><STRONG><EM>Note to Editors<BR>

</EM></STRONG><BR>

In December 1995 the dual listed companies merger of RTZ and CRA was
completed, as a result of which both companies have common boards of
directors and are managed on a unified basis.<BR>

<BR>

The above changes in board membership follow the retirement of Mr W L
Dix, a non-executive director, in September 1996. As previously
announced, Sir Derek Birkin, non-executive chairman of RTZ, will also
retire on 31 December 1996 from the boards of RTZ and CRA and will be
succeeded by Mr Robert Wilson as executive chairman of RTZ.<BR>

<BR>

As a consequence of all these changes the size of the boards will be
reduced from 20 at the start of 1996 to 18 at the start of 1997.<BR>

<BR>

Mr Pemberton, an Australian, has been chairman of Qantas Airways
Limited since 1993. Mr Pemberton was appointed chief executive of
Brambles in 1983 and managing director in 1984. He has recently
retired from the Brambles board. He was formerly a member of the
boards of Commonwealth Bank of Australia, CSR Limited and John
Fairfax Holdings Limited, the Benevolent Society of NSW and the NSW
Government's Economic Development Council. He is a member of the
Phillips Australia Advisory Board.<BR>

<BR>

Mr Seitz, a US citizen, was US Ambassador to the United Kingdom from
1991 to 1994, the culmination of a distinguished career in the US
Foreign Service. He is Vice Chairman of Lehman Brothers International
(Europe) and a non executive director of British Airways, Cable &amp;
Wireless, GEC and Shandwick. A graduate of Yale University, Mr Seitz
is a Trustee of The National Gallery and The Royal Academy.<BR>
