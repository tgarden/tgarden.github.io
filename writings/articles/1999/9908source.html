<H3><CENTER>Minor Adjustments to the Defence Programme?
</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><I>by Sir Timothy Garden</I></CENTER></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	The annual defence white paper is always a heady mixture of
self congratulation, wild optimism and selective release of
information. Yet, there was unusually widespread agreement that the
Strategic Defence Review (SDR) paper published last year was a good
analysis of the UK needs in the post Cold War world. The plans
appeared reasonably realistic both in timings and costs. But the
track record of previous annual defence statements gives little
confidence in their ability to survive the events of even a single
year, let alone plan for the coming decade. One year on from the SDR
much has happened in the foreign policy and security field. The
defence programme may now need more than just a tweak at the margins.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Defence requirements are driven by foreign policy, and there
have been some notable changes to the foreign policy assumptions in
the past 12 months. Of greatest significance has been the volte face
on European defence. The SDR was developed from the traditional
atlanticist foreign policy assumptions. It makes little mention of
the European dimension of defence planning. This is scarcely
surprising as the Government did not make its U-turn on European
defence co-operation until after the SDR had been completed. Experts
on both sides of the Channel are still trying to decode the delphic
pronouncements of  Tony Blair at the British-French summit at St Malo
in early December 1998. It is however clear that the Prime Minister
is serious about seeking better ways for the Europeans to provide
defence capability, and that the UK is to be at the heart of Europe
in this respect.  The second post-SDR foreign policy change has been
the announcement last month that the UK is to allocate significant
forces on call for United Nations operations. Requests for such an
arrangement had in the past been resisted by successive British
governments. Thirdly, in mid July, Robin Cook was reported as making
overtures for the establishment of an EU rapid reaction force. This
was followed almost immediately (20 July 1999) by the Anglo-Italian
declaration on the European Defence Initiatives, which called for
European-wide goals in the defence field.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	If the foreign policy drivers, which shaped the SDR, have
changed over the past year, then equally recent military experience
has tested some of the core planning assumptions. The lessons of
Kosovo will take many months to formulate. At this stage, there will
be some broad generalisations, which are likely to shape the defence
programme. While it did not prove necessary to move beyond the air
campaign, the government will be very well aware of how shortage of
army manpower constrained its actions. With Northern Ireland
currently less hopeful, continuing commitments in Bosnia and Kosovo,
and army retention rates low, there is little capacity for new
exciting foreign policy initiatives for the UN and the EU. While such
roles will be covered by double earmarking of forces, they will still
have to train with other contributing nations for the new roles.
However much forces are double and triple earmarked, army manpower
numbers do not add up. The vicious spiral of overcommitment, followed
by poor retention which leads to more over commitment must be cured.
Since it is clear that reduction in commitments is no part of the
agenda, urgent measures will need to increase the army establishment,
as well as separate measures to improve retention. Both of these
carry significant unplanned costs. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Experience in Kosovo will also affect the assumptions about the
forward equipment programme. For all the great investment in air
systems, the UK was a relatively minor contributor to the offensive
air campaign. The predilection of NATO air forces to spend  so much
of their money on fighters was again proved to be less than sensible.
 In the war of statistics it may be politically useful to claim air
defence sorties as part of the Alliance contribution, but in the real
war for Kosovo it was modern offensive airpower with timely
reconnaissance that counted. It still remains a mystery as to why it
was thought worthwhile, in a blaze of publicity, to park a British
aircraft carrier in the Aegean for some of the conflict. The Sea
Harrier sorties counted towards the war effort, yet did little but
protect the carrier itself. The planners will want to see new
emphasis on cruise missiles, smart bombs and GPS guided bombs. This
will mean procuring both new weapons and more stocks. If other
nations take the same lesson, it could mean that Eurofighter numbers
will come under pressure, thus raising the unit costs. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	It should also be now coming clear where the real financial
risks are in the SDR assumptions. The SDR contained a number of
exciting new innovations, which because of their novelty were
difficult to cost or time accurately. Smart procurement, Public
Private Partnership, fast defence lands disposal and  the central
logistics organisation are big ticket items. It would be surprising
if all go according to plan. There will also be the now routine cost
growth in the equipment programme which the NAO criticises with such
relish every year. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	When the new  commitments and the new demands both for manpower
and equipment are fed into a programme which is already showing signs
of being overheated, it looks as though rather more than minor
adjustments may be needed soon. One answer would be to have a real
increase in the defence budget by perhaps as much as 10% or around
&#163;2bn. This would certainly signal that the Government was very
serious about its leadership in Europe on defence matters. The
alternative is the usual messy mix of damaging savings measures,
delayed equipment and increasing overstretch.</P>
