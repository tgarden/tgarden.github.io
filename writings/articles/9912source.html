<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	A triumph for our diplomats is yet again
headlined following the Anglo-French Summit in London on 25 November
1999. To read the joint declaration, it would appear that Britain and
France have solved the problems of years of decline in European
provision for defence capability. Unfortunately, the cozy agreement
as yet gives little prospect of any real improvement in the armed
forces of Europe, or indeed any hope of extra money for defence.

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	It is just coming up to the first
anniversary of Tony Blair's inspired change of direction on European
defence at St Malo. The Strategic Defence Review had been published
in July 1998 based on an essentially Atlanticist approach to foreign
policy. Little progress had been possible towards the European
Security and Defence Identity so long as the UK continued blocking
attempts to make Europe have a voice within NATO. At St Malo, in
December 1998, Tony Blair signalled a willingness to explore ways to
develop a European defence identity. The experiences of Kosovo
underlined the need for Europe to be more effective. The 15 EU
nations together spend over &#163;100 billion on their armed forces
last year. Yet, when a real crisis landed in their backyard, they
needed the USA to provide 80% of the effort for the air operation
over Kosovo. Europe has over 3000 combat aircraft and nearly 2
million men in uniform, but is unable to muster any useful military
power for a relatively small scale operation in the Balkans.</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The focus in 1999 has been on how to
develop real European defence capabilities, and Tony Blair has taken
a personal lead in this endeavour. It has been said that he is trying
to compensate for lack of progress in bringing the UK into monetary
union. He worked hard at the NATO summit in Washington in April, and
NATO signed up to the Defence Capabilities Initiative with its check
list of 58 areas for improvement. At the WEU ministerial in May, the
groundwork was done for the EU to take over the defence role of the
Western European Union. The EU summit in Cologne, the following
month, kept up the pressure. In July, the Anglo-Italian summit gave
Tony Blair the opportunity to push forward a timetable for action and
the suggestion of performance criteria. Through the summer, UK MOD
officials had been hinting that there would be a major initiative
before the end of the year, which would greatly enhance Europe's
capabilities. Appropriately, the launch for the big idea was at the
Anglo-French summit of 24/25 November 1999. The two nations have
called upon the European Council, which meets in Helsinki next month,
 to take a decisive step forward to increase defence capabilities to
enable them to conduct EU-led operations as well as playing their
full role in Alliance operations. Arrangements will need to be
designed so that the EU has an autonomous capacity for use when NATO
as a whole is not engaged. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	How is this ambitious project to be
realised? The Joint Declaration looks to EU members cooperating to
provide a rapidly deployable and sustainable force up to Corps level
with all the necessary command,control and intelligence capabilities,
logistics, combat support, service support and appropriate naval and
air combat forces. The ground forces are likely to number up to
60,000. The main body of the force should be available at 60 days
notice and sustainable for at least a year. To be able to make the
necessary decisions on military capabilities, new EU structures will
be needed. In particular there will need to be a Military Committee
and military staff dedicated to EU-led operations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	At one level, what is proposed is a
sensible attempt to make some progress in harmonising defence effort
across the EU so that it can at least generate a force of 60,000 men
out of its 2 million troops. It also gives a welcome impetus for the
development of some key capabilities such as intelligence and
strategic airlift. What it does not do is generate a single extra
soldier, tank, aircraft or ship. It gives the free-rider nations in
Europe an opportunity to run their defence forces down further by
concentrating only on their contribution to this new force. The 
agreement over contributions will be prolonged and devious. Years of
experience at fudging goals in the NATO force planning process will
give little hope of achieving the Corps capability easily or in full.
There will be many subplots to prolong the negotiations. The internal
fighting for command posts has already started with both France and
the UK offering their headquarters as the planning centre. </FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	What does the proposal mean for the two
lead nations, the rest of the EU and for those members of NATO, who
are not in the EU? It is clear that within the British Ministry of
Defence there is great rejoicing. They see it as the best outcome to
concerns over a Prime Minister who was being worryingly serious about
European co-operation on defence. The proposals require no great
change to British arrangements, but might throw up the odd extra 3
star post, which is always welcomed. As to extra commitments, the
requirements will be added to Robin Cook's offering of forces for the
UN: double and triple hatting of existing capabilities will do the
trick. Likewise the French, having had a relatively good war in
Kosovo, see their influence increasing without the need to change
their force structures.  For the rest of the EU, there will be some
relief that they can play this development long, and can continue
reducing defence expenditure while the deliberations are inevitably
extended. It will cause a particular problem for Germany, which had
announced its intention to generate its own rapidly deployable force
of 50,000 men. They should be happy that this will give them a
respectable let out at a time when they are trying to cut defence
spending by 20-30%. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Those States that are members of either
the EU or NATO, but not of both, remain a problem. Sweden and Finland
should be happy to find a way to work with NATO without having to
join. Austria and Ireland may be more difficult. The new NATO members
are looking to joining the EU and should cause no difficulties.
Turkey will certainly worry about being left out and will require
careful handling, and Norway may begin to feel a little isolated. The
real problem seems to be with the United States. There has been a
great deal of unnecessary stirring of American worries, not least by
Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative party defence spokesman. In
former times, it was the practice for opposition spokesman to support
national policy when abroad. He seems to have fired up anti-European
sentiment with his recent visit to Congress. Since there is little
hope of anything in the way of  a real capability being developed in
the near term,  it is unfortunate to offend the key NATO member, the
USA, with shadows.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Tony Blair seems to have a serious wish to
make European defence work. It may be that the proposal to be taken
in Helsinki will at least put in place an institutional structure
where the EU can develop real capabilities. An early need will be to
look at establishing a budget for EU defence activity. However, it is
clear that his MOD do not see themselves as having to change their
national approach to defence. They will be happy to provide some
extra Generals to show these foreigners how to organise an army.
Those who want Europe to field effective military forces should not
sit back and wait for EU military staffs to make it happen.</FONT>
