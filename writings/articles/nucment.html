<P>	If the end of the Cold War did not signal the end of history,
it certainly made the arcane world of the nuclear strategist seem
past its sell by date. Yet, nuclear weapons are back on the agenda in
Iraq, India, Pakistan and North Korea.  Russia still has thousands of
nukes, but cannot afford to pay its military to look after them, or
its engineers to dismantle them.  The politics and management of
nuclear deterrence  is  very much an issue for today as well as one
of historical interest.</P>

<P>	Dr Heuser has produced a scholarly survey of the  debates about
nuclear weapons in Britain, France and Germany since 1945.   I doubt
that many readers will find the attitudes of each nation's elite
unexpected.  She rightly credits the United Kingdom with much of the
innovative thinking on nuclear matters in NATO for which it received
little credit in Europe. Britain built its nuclear capability because
it had been intimately involved in the Manhattan Project and saw
itself as having a continuing world power role. It developed a number
of entirely logical rationales for retention of nuclear capability as
its status in the world declined. Heuser is somewhat unfair on the
current government to suggest  that it has steered clear of raising
the nuclear question. It has been surprisingly robust on retaining a
nuclear capability and seems likely to continue that policy.</P>

<P>	The chapter on France is a wonderful survey of all the
paradoxes of lost influence which have shaped the country after the
war. Nuclear weapons, which had to be truly independent, were seen as
essential for the glory of France. The debate was always at a
philosophical level. The enemy remained vague; and the battle plan
seemed irrelevant. France wanted to lead Europe, but was unwilling to
share sovereignty on nuclear matters. The recent French approach to
nuclear testing in the Pacific suggests that the mentality has not
changed.</P>

<P>	The Federal Republic of Germany differs in that it has no
nuclear weapons of its own. However, it was very much part of NATO
nuclear strategy in the Cold War. American and British nuclear
weapons were located in Germany, and French tactical nuclear weapons
had such short range that they must have been aimed at targets there.
While there is ample evidence of the antipathy to militarism in post
war Germany, there is no doubt that the German nation contributed a
very major part to the effectiveness of nuclear deterrence.</P>

<P>	The book is shorter than it appears. The three chapters
allocated to each country are each supported by copious notes of
sources. Over 1750 notes and the index take up a third of the volume.
As an indication of scholastic diligence this is admirable, but they
add little to the argument. It will be a useful book for the student
of NATO strategy, but is unlikely to appeal to a wider audience, who
probably already understand the essential differences between the
mentalities of the three nations.</P>
