		<h4>Background Assumptions</h4>
		<p>The United States has been interested in protecting itself from the threat of ballistic missile attack for over 40 years. The short warning times, great distances and high speed of flight of long range ballistic missiles have made such a defence difficult to design. In the 1960s, the approach was to use very fast interceptors which would themselves carry a nuclear warhead. The theory was that incoming missiles with nuclear warheads could be destroyed before they re-entered the atmosphere using a nearby nuclear explosion. For a brief period (April 1975 to February 1976) the US deployed a ballistic missile defence (BMD) system called Safeguard.  The system was made up of a perimeter acquisition radar, a missile site radar, a long range missile (Spartan) and a high acceleration short range missile (Sprint). This was a basic layered defence with nuclear tipped interceptors. The short range missiles were designed to catch any incoming weapons which had penetrated the high altitude interception layer. The use of nuclear armed interceptors carried many obvious disadvantages for the defender. The only realistic strategic rationale was as a defensive screen for retaliatory forces, and this could therefore have been justified in terms of preserving second strike capability and thus reinforcing deterrence. It had little utility as a pure defence of US territory. <br>
			<br>
			The desire to protect US territory with a BMD system was next expressed by President Reagan in March 1983. This led to a large research and development programme under the auspices of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). Costs, technical problems and the ending of the Cold War meant that Congressional support declined over time. In January 1991, President Bush revived elements of the SDI programme with proposals for a Global Protection Against Limited Strikes (GPALS) system. This was abandoned by his successor, President Clinton, who initially changed the focus to Theatre Missile Defences (TMD). <br>
			<br>
			In the second term of the Clinton presidency, a renewed focus on the possibility of a National Missile Defence (NMD) emerged. The threat to be countered was the possibility of a weapon of mass destruction (WMD) ballistic missile attack by proliferating states such as North Korea, Iran and Iraq. The Clinton proposals would have required a number of international negotiations. In particular, Russia would need to agree significant changes to the letter and spirit of the 1972 Anti Ballistic Missile  (ABM) Treaty. Denmark would have to agree to a physical upgrade to the Early Warning Radar at  Thule, Greenland. The UK would have to agree to a physical upgrade to its similar radar at Fylingdales, and also to a link from Menwith Hill for Space-Based Infra-Red System (SBIRS) satellite data to be integrated into an NMD system. Following the failure of a test of part of the intercept system on 7 July 2000, President Clinton remitted decisions on future NMD systems to his successor.<br>
			<br>
			President George W.Bush has made attainment of a NMD capability a central part of his defence policy. His appointment of Donald Rumsfeld as Defense Secretary underlines the seriousness of intent. Rumsfeld had produced the influential report on the threat from proliferating states, and was a very strong advocate of the need for NMD before his return to the Defense Department. The new administration is determined to explore all avenues for a technical solution. It is not yet clear what the detailed architecture of such a system will be, but it is assumed that it is likely to envisage a more comprehensive system that the earlier Clinton scheme. Almost certainly any proposed system would seek to upgrade the Danish and UK radars to X-Band. There might also be proposals for forward deployments of missiles. Timescales remain very uncertain, but are certainly longer than originally envisaged. Renegotiation of, or withdrawal from, the ABM treaty is likely to be necessary at a relatively early stage. The technologies are still far from proven. Even a light defensive system could not be operational within the first term of office of President Bush. Costs are even more uncertain.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Analysis of the implications of an NMD programme can be done from a number of viewpoints. The views of a US voter may be different from a European or a Japanese citizen. In this analysis a number of different perspectives are considered in order to derive a rational European approach. First, the possible effects  on global security are examined. The changes that NMD deployment might make to US security are also important to the rest of the world. This leads to analysis of the possible effects on European security and how Europe should react to the proposals. </p>
		<h4>Technical Feasibility</h4>
		<p>It is difficult to make any realistic assumption about the timescale and cost of any system that might be deployed. In the author&#146;s view, the history of the past 40 years should act as a strong warning about the difficulties inherent in any missile defences. We have made some progress in the defence of point targets (such as ships) from missile threats. However, the problem is much simpler when the target is known in advance, and the defences can therefore be optimised. There is a high degree of scepticism among the UK defence scientific establishment about the technical feasibility of wide area missile defence. For the purposes of this analysis, it will be assumed that any deployed NMD system will have some capability to intercept incoming missiles and warheads, but that we cannot yet know whether the leakage rate will be small or large. Any argument into the implications of NMD needs to take into account the possibility that either the system effectiveness may vary between being relatively porous to being highly effective against small numbers of incoming missiles. Nor should theoretical laboratory values of effectiveness be assumed to be representative of what might be achieved under actual conditions.</p>
		<h4>Global Security Effects</h4>
		<p>Some effects of possible deployment of an NMD system on global security are already being felt. There is a strong perception in China that the proposed system is scaled against their strategic deterrent force, and that this is further evidence of the US wish to dominate the world militarily. Discussions with Chinese military, diplomats, academics and officials over the past year reveal a consistent suspicion of US motives across the range of military activities. Although the future of Taiwan is a key concern (and this plays on Chinese concerns over TMD), there is also a wider worry about long term US aims. The focus by the new US administration on NMD is seen by the Chinese as a confirmatory  sign of this analysis. The lack of ratification by the US of the CTBT is another, and there is a widespread belief by them that the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in 1999 was deliberate. Doubtless, the recent E-P3 aircraft incident will be added to the list of woes.<br>
			<br>
			Although China has been a nuclear power since 1964, it has been remarkably slow in deploying a second strike capability, and currently is assessed as having about 20 strategic nuclear missiles. Priority in funding seems to have to gone to the economy rather than military build up. The change in perception of US aims is likely to have strengthened the pro-military lobby within China. This may partially explain the significant projected increase in defence spending of 18% rise over the coming year. The defence budget is however still relatively small for a country of China&#146;s size. It seems likely that those in China who advocate an increase in  strategic nuclear capability will be in a stronger position if they believe that an NMD system will be deployed.<br>
			<br>
			India first demonstrated a nuclear capability in 1974 with its &#147;Peaceful Nuclear  Explosion&#148;. It has seen its main threat as coming from China. It also has a wish to be  a leader in the region given its size. It must also  consider the development of a nuclear capability by Pakistan. The tests, which both conducted in 1998,  are  part of competitive arms race between the two of them. There is therefore a complex interaction between China, India and Pakistan in mutual perceptions of any changes in nuclear posture.<br>
			<br>
			Russia will have an important role to play in how NMD affects global security. It appears to be prepared to take a more pragmatic view of developments, but is nevertheless concerned by possible US unilateralism. The ABM treaty is one protocol which recognises it as on an equal status with the US, and it would be affronted by a unilateral withdrawal by the Americans. It is much weakened economically and in military capability. There will be those who would be reluctant to continue with strategic arms reductions if Russian views were ignored over NMD proposals. Russia would also have an interest in possible reactions in China, where there is a historic rivalry. There may be diplomatic trades on offer between the US and Russia. The next phase of NATO enlargement is one such area for negotiation. <br>
			<br>
			The effects of all these influences on potential WMD proliferators and the states of concern are more difficult to quantify. Iran is almost certainly interested in the possibility of gaining a nuclear capability. It sees itself as potentially threatened by neighbours with WMD capabilities, and it believes that it needs to be able to deter a number of potential enemies. It has particular concerns about both Iraq and Israel. The development of a US NMD is unlikely to make a great deal of difference to the strategic analysis in Iran, as its perceived threats are much closer to hand. Iraq continues to attempt to acquire a WMD capability. It is also more concerned by local enemies, in particular Iran and Israel. While it might see advantage in being able to implicitly threaten Europe and the US to prevent interference in its affairs, NMD is unlikely to alter its current procurement strategy. There are many alternative delivery systems for long range attack with WMD, and it is likely to look at developing these. Both Iraq and Iran also see acquisition of WMD as enhancing their status as regional powers.  North Korea is a different case, and the progress made in reconciliation with the South over the past year gives hope that it may be possible to solve the problem of proliferation there. It is unfortunate that the US seems to have turned away from the process of engagement for the moment. In any event, a potential NMD system is unlikely to have a major effect on the dynamics of the situation there.<br>
			<br>
			In summary, the potential deployment of an NMD system, whether it works or not, may have a negative security effect on China, the Indian sub-continent and Russia. The interaction between the nuclear players could reduce the incentives for arms control, and push each towards increasing its fielded nuclear capability. This might not make a great deal of difference to global security in absolute terms, but could change the climate of international relations for the worse. Any unilateral withdrawal from the ABM treaty by the US would add to this climate of mutual suspicion. The development, as may be necessary for some NMD systems, of space based weapon systems would be a further unhelpful step in global arms control. Nor does NMD seems to offer any prospect to the world of a change in the drivers for proliferation. Indeed, it could be argued that it will encourage the development of less traditional methods of delivery for WMD systems.</p>
		<h4>US Security Effects</h4>
		<p>The way that an NMD programme would affect US perceptions of its own security are important when looking at the whole picture. It is sometimes argued that an NMD system would allow the US to be more pro-active in its role as a global policeman. The question is posed as to whether the US would have been prepared to intervene in Kuwait against a nuclear armed Saddam, or in Kosovo against a nuclear armed Milosevic. Certainly, there may be an element of this thinking in the minds of potential proliferators. However, any  US President would have to make a difficult judgement about the efficacy of his NMD system. If he would have been deterred from intervention by the possibility of a WMD attack on the US, would he be so confident in the effectiveness of an NMD system that he would change his appreciation of the situation? Given the power of nuclear weapons, the effect on his thinking is likely to be minimal. If US vital interests are at stake, intervention may be undertaken and mutual deterrence keeps any conflict at the conventional level (the Gulf War gives an example of this as Iraq had both chemical and biological warfare capability which it was deterred from using). If there is only a limited US interest at stake and an assumption of an irrational enemy, the President would not be prepared to rely on a 95% assurance of an NMD system working. With nuclear weapons the risks are always too high, which is why deterrence has been so effective over the years.<br>
			<br>
			In any look at the effects of NMD on US security thinking, the question of costs must also be taken into account. Although the US defence budget is large, it is not limitless. US forces are suffering from many of the shortcomings experienced by European forces. Too much of their equipment dates from Cold War scenarios, retention of personnel is difficult, and costs are rising faster than budgets. The Director of the Congressional Budget Office identified a shortfall of around $50bn a year just to sustain current US capabilities. The open ended commitment to NMD technologies will divert resources needed for more mundane upgrading and sustainability. Coupled with a focus on new technologies for military operations, the difficulties of working with Allies will increase over the years. It could therefore be that a US with NMD would be less able to intervene because of weaknesses in its deployable capabilities, even if it felt safer because of NMD.<br>
			<br>
			Finally, it must be anticipated that work on a limited NMD system will give rise to calls for a more extensive system in due course. The political logic which argues for US territory to be safe from a limited threat will lead to a call for protection against larger threats.</p>
		<h4>European Regional and National Security Effects</h4>
		<p>If European nations are to express views on US development of NMD, they should do it from the perspective of their own regional and national interests. If NMD had no effect on stability and security outside of the US, it would be inappropriate for the Europeans to criticise such proposals. How US taxpayers decide to spend their money is their business if it does no harm to the rest of the world. However, the examination above of possible reactions by the key global players points to a possible increase in numbers and types of nuclear systems, a reduction of mutual trust, and a lack of confidence in arms control for the future. None of these negative security trends are certain; but they are possible. On the positive side of the equation, there seems little to welcome except for a questionable possibility that the US will be more willing to act on behalf of the international community.<br>
			<br>
			From a purely European viewpoint, it might be considered that the risk of such a downturn in global security would be acceptable in exchange for an assurance of being included under the umbrella of US missile defences. This would only be the case if such an extended missile defence system were technically feasible, impermeable, affordable and available simultaneously with the US system. It is unlikely that these criteria could be met, and if they were it would reinforce a perception of a divided world. Indeed there is a different perspective on how to tackle the limited problem of proliferating states. The international community has had some success in reducing the number of potential nuclear weapon states over the years, and Europeans believe that the process should continue. In particular the NPT should be the vehicle for progress in this field.<br>
			<br>
			Negotiations on the future of the ABM treaty are a key security interest for Europeans given the proximity of Russia. It would be unfortunate if diplomatic trades, such as phasing or abandonment of NATO enlargement, were to undermine progress towards to greater security in Central and Eastern Europe. It is very much in Europe&#146;s interests to continue the process of nuclear arms reductions in Russia, and this may be affected if Russia feels its interests are not given appropriate weight. A unilateral withdrawal by the US from the ABM treaty would be likely to result in Russia responding in like manner over START  and INF. However, even a satisfactory renegotiation with Russia would leave China suspicious, isolated and unhelpful on other arms control processes.<br>
			<br>
			Two European nations, UK and France, have an interest as nuclear weapon states. This is not much voiced in current debates. However, a fully deployed NMD system  might make it difficult to claim that either had true independence from US decision making. In the current international system, this is probably of little significance.<br>
			<br>
			Two European nations, UK and Denmark, have a special interest as host governments to joint user systems which are likely to be upgraded for any NMD system. While neither the UK nor Denmark are signatories of the bi-lateral ABM treaty, they have an interest in its observation and continuance. The necessary upgrades to Thule, Fylingdales and Menwith Hill are not permitted under the current ABM treaty. The upgraded X-band radar sites would become the forward eyes of an NMD system. They would therefore become the priority targets  for any enemy which wished to penetrate a US NMD system. Nor would an attack on them necessarily be carried out by ballistic missile. An effective NMD system would need its forward radars defended against all forms of ground and air threat. This may require a significant air defence (including point anti-missile defence) and ground defence of the sites. It has been suggested by some that the sites would be protected by an extended NMD system. This would be more expensive and more difficult to arrange, and would inevitably have a higher leakage rate. It appears that the US would expect those nations coming under an NMD protective screen to contribute to the costs of the system.<br>
			<br>
			In summary, from a European perspective there are a number of possible negative security implications in the development of a US or alliance missile defence system. Russia needs to be engaged to ensure future security in Europe. It also needs to continue with its programme of strategic arms reductions. Managing NATO and EU enlargement needs to be done in a way which builds confidence. Europe is finding it difficult to fund current defence requirements, and diversion of funds towards an extended NMD system is not a high priority. For the UK and Denmark there are additional security concerns which would stem from being the home to the forward eyes of any NMD system.</p>
		<h4>Policy Implications for European Governments</h4>
		<p>In deciding how to address the NMD proposals, the easiest route for most European governments would be to ignore the problem. They have no requirement to take an official position as they are not signatories of the ABM treaty, and with the exception of UK and Denmark they have no installations which they must approve. However any NMD deployment (whether it eventually works or not) may have an effect on European security. Ideally, the EU should decide on a common policy towards this important security issue. This will be difficult, but perhaps more possible after the recent EU initiatives on Korea and on Kyoto.The alternative to an EU policy is for European national governments to adopt policies according to their particular circumstances. <br>
			<br>
			In the background of all policy thinking is the question of future relationships with the United States. There are already strains in that relationship over developments in EU defence arrangements. European nations do not wish to undermine NATO, but they do believe that they should play a more significant role in the transatlantic partnership. The abrupt withdrawal of US participation in the Kyoto protocol has also put strains on relationships. Global warming is seen by European governments as a problem which must be addressed globally. The US, as a major greenhouse gas producer, has declared national economic interest as the most important factor in its decision making.<br>
			<br>
			All of this makes policy recommendations over NMD very difficult. It is possible to argue that moves towards NMD are more likely to reduce security for European countries. However, if it is assumed that the US intends to continue this work regardless of views from Europe, the question then becomes whether European security will be better or worse after a confrontation with the US over its proposals. The answer to this question is almost certainly that an added contentious issue would not help NATO cohesion. Falling out between Europe and the US over security matters is not in the interests of global or regional security.<br>
			<br>
			This does not mean that the Europeans have no role to play in the development of US policy. They have a keen interest in the promotion of arms control, and in a satisfactory renegotiation of the ABM treaty. Both the UK and Denmark would be justified in making modifications to their installations conditional on Russia and the US agreeing the necessary amendments to the ABM treaty. They might also require that they be involved in the negotiations given their role as host nations. They should be supported by the EU in taking this position. The EU might also make its support for a renegotiated ABM treaty conditional on extending the Outer Space Treaty to cover all weapons and not just nuclear weapons in space. Finally, the ABM treaty renegotiation should ensure that any NMD system capability is limited in scale to coping with future proliferating states and does not become open ended. Even these limited aims would prove difficult to sell to the US as they would be seen as giving Russia a veto on the process. The case should be made that the involvement of Europe in the negotiations could be helpful in this respect. Acting as honest brokers, with a real security interest in the outcome, a negotiated outcome might be more likely. <br>
