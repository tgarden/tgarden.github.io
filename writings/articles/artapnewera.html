<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>I have a pretty daunting task this morning. We have the results of
the Air Power Workshop in this excellent new volume of Perspectives
on Air Power. It is chock full of thoughtful analysis and is a real
contribution to the intellectual debate. We will be debating the
issues throughout the day, and I have no intention of pre-empting
that discussion. Nor do I intend to make this contribution a review
of the arguments in the book. Rather, I intend to give a very
personal view of the international and national context within which
military power in general, and air power in particular, will find
itself placed in the coming years.</P>

<P>For us in Europe, our approach to security really has changed in
the past ten years. The benchmarks for measuring our military needs
have evaporated. Our defence needs appear less urgent to our people
and their elected representatives, and the black and white division
between good guys and bad guys is much less easy. Yet wars, between
States and within States, continue, and large numbers of people both
military and civilian continue to die earlier than necessary because
of conflict.</P>

<P>On the world stage, we have the novelty of a single super-power.
The USA is pre-eminent in terms of both economic and military
strength - and yet, because of the far sightedness of the founding
fathers, is constrained from the traditional imperialism that goes
with such power. Nevertheless, in any examination of the utility of
military power, we must now always consider the part that the USA
will play.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>It is therefore, as the title of today's conference claims, "A New
Era"; but an era which is messier and perhaps less predictable than
those that have gone before. Air power proponents have often assumed
that technological improvements would provide ever better answers to
security needs, and that could be true for particular needs. However
as the requirements become less certain, and the international
concerns less amenable to military solution, we need to examine
carefully the most resilient ways of resourcing military capability
to meet the very varied demands of the international community.</P>

<H3>Questions</H3>

<P>The questions I want to address are: What we will need air power
for, how do we live with the different scale of US air power, and can
we sustain political interest in providing the necessary resources?
</P>

<P>How would it be if we imagine ourselves at the midpoint of an
airpower history being written for the celebrations in the year 2100.
</P>

<H3>Looking Back</H3>

<P>Our future historian would look back to phases of air power as we
do today. He would marvel at the speed with which the different main
air power roles were developed, so that all had been deployed in
major war within 15 years of the the first heavier than air flight.
Technology refined the weapon systems, sensors and control
arrangements in the furnace of WW2. The missiles and nuclear warheads
then dominated airpower application for nearly half a century. We are
in a phase now where the advent of smart weapons and information
dominance seem to be key, but we have not yet got the historical
perspective to be able to say whether these technologies, and their
applications, will rate a chapter or just a footnote in the year
2100.</P>

<H3>Looking Forward</H3>

<P>This discipline of seeing how we view the past is sobering when we
have to contemplate what provisions we should make for the future.
There is a tendency to assume that lesser powers should follow the
USA and look for high technology, power projection capabilities with
reduction of own casulaties as the main driver. This appeals
particularly to the air power proponent as aerospace systems tend to
be associated with the sexiest technologies, and there is an
expectation that we should keep the butchery of war at a safe
distance from one's own citizens, even when they are in uniform.</P>

<P>There are however many counter pressures. Throughout its history
the provision of air power has been an expensive undertaking.
Separate air forces were necessary to ensure the resources were used
wisely both in procurement and in deployment. Yet without some
obvious national security problem, defence resources decline. And if
there is less cash, there is also a less obvious need for the most
advanced weapon systems when the security problem is more likely to
be an ethnically cleansed refugee or a starving child in Africa.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>The World in the next 30 years</H3>

<P>Most defence planning tries to extrapolate the experience of the
recent past. This in military circles is the trap of planning for the
last war instead of the next one. In the technology area
extrapolations are sometimes made of the experience of the small
scale laboratory innovation to assume that it will be adopted
world-wide in a very short time. The trouble with all such
forecasting is that it fails, by definition, to take into account the
unpredictable key events or applications of technology. In
international affairs, we have seen the change in the Middle East
that has resulted from an assassin's bullet which killed Prime
Minister Rabin. The widescale use of integrated circuits has changed
the way that the world operates over the past 30 years. Putting
ourselves back 30 years, we might have expected that nuclear power
would have been providing us with clean cheap energy. Yet Chernobyl
and 3 mile island have changed perspectives. So I start this look at
the future from a position of great humility. All I can do is give
some possibilities for the way the world will develop, and what that
means for air power.</P>

<H3>A Continuing World?</H3>

<P>In any security analysis, the first question to ask is whether
there is any threat, however small, of our total annihilation. With
the end of the Cold War, we have reduced the risk of extinguishing
life through a massive strategic nuclear exchange. There are still
more than enough nuclear weapons to put as risk the viability of the
planet, but we have more confidence that they will not be used. To
reduce the risk yet further means that we must continue the arms
reductions in this area. It perhaps also means that military planning
will look at ways to reduce the threat of accidental nuclear use. In
India and Pakistan we should be seeking to transfer technology for
better control of their primitive nuclear systems. There is also the
pressure for de-alerting. As the worry of a nuclear winter has
receded we have seen new global concerns emerge: ozone layer
depletion, global warming, over-fishing, reducing biodiversity,
atmospheric pollution, reduction in fresh water sources, population
growth, epidemics. None of these are likely to threaten the
survivability of the species in the next 30 years, but all of them
represent key problems that will need to be addressed during the
period. There is also the random possibility of a strike by an
asteroid or comet, and it may be that the risk will be seen as
significant enough for work to be needed. Indeed, some suggest that
it is the sort of issue that air power strategists should focus on.
However for the purpose air power planning, I shall be assuming that
the world will make it to 2030, but that it will be a much more
crowded, polluted and perhaps tense world.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>International relations</H3>

<P>Any plan for the future must consider the relations between
states. There seems to be a growing tendency for the power of the
State to decline. In one direction, many issues need to be dealt with
at the supranational level. Regional groupings form for economic
reasons initially, but develop into political entities. The debate
over a federal Europe is all about the vision of the economic
community transforming into a political entity with its own foreign
and security policy. In other parts of the world parallel moves are
happening, but the others are all at an earlier stage than the EU. We
see NAFTA in North America, Mercosur in South America, ASEAN in the
Asia-Pacific, and so on.</P>

<P>It is too early to say how these regional groupings will mature:
they appear in some cases to look as though there are limits to the
degree of integration possible at the supranational level. Yet in 30
years time, it would be surprising if some had not formed
arrangements akin to superstates. One might envisage a European, an
American and an Asian set of such groupings. They might by then be
co-operating or competing. From a defence planning perspective one
needs to make judgements about the future of the US relationship. At
the supranational level, the development of global organisations will
also be important. The United Nations may be very different. It might
have become more effective in its decision-making, have the power to
implement decisions, and be an effective monitor of international
behaviour. Perhaps, more likely, it will have become less effective
as the membership of the security council is expanded, and decision
making becomes more difficult. Certainly the signs are that the
process of changing the membership may itself be pretty damaging as
arguments break out of which nations should represent particular
regions. Many would argue for a future where the UN could act as the
World's policeman with appropriate forces on hand to enforce
international law. I rather doubt that this will come to pass in the
next 30 years, although it was interesting to hear Kofi Anan at
Ditchley 10 days ago making a very strong case for such a force..The
World Trade Organisation may however have developed to be a far more
important entity in moderating international behaviour. We are in the
early days yet, and there are plenty of opportunities for it to lose
power, particularly if the US is selective in which rulings it is
prepared to accept. However, given the universal advantage in well
regulated trade arrangements, it may be that WTO is a better horse to
back as a future global coordinator.</P>

<P>If I take a spin around the world, I can only give a very
superficial analysis of the way States and Regions seem to be moving.
We have a perception today that the states of Western Europe,
including the UK, are stable, co-operative, rich and technologically
advanced. We worry about high costs of labour, we enjoy reasonable
growth, with unemployment a problem for many of the countries. We
look to an expansion of this sphere of stability to encompass Central
and eastern Europe. New members of the EU coming on stream within 5
years, and an expectation that that process continues. Problems may
include FRY, Russia and the North African littoral states.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>There are of course black scenarios which might look at today as
being the peak of EU development as the strains of greater
integration, and monetary union in particular, lead to a fracturing
of the carefully built consensus. Or that the strains of taking on
new members, without some fundamental reforms of the CAP, cause the
EU to stultify. Or that the great Russian democratic experiment fails
with a fall into complete lawlessness, anarchy or military coup. Or
that the populous poor of North Africa repeat the Islamic invasion of
the past, this time seeking food rather than conquest. All these are
possible, but in my view less likely than a progressive extension of
the EU strengthening security and prosperity in Europe.</P>

<P>However, at the Eastern end of the Mediterranean there is a more
intractable problem between Israel and its neighbouring states. 30
years ago Arab/Israeli wars happened, and it may be that will remain
possible for many years to come. That the current peace process was
so profoundly affected by the murder of Rabin is an indication of the
difficulty in making predictions for the region. However until there
is a harmonious relationship between an Israel that feels safe and a
viable Palestinian state, it is likely to remain a future worry. For
the remainder of the Middle East, and perhaps in the Caucasus as
well, the availability of oil is likely to be a factor which is of
increasing interest to the rest of the world.</P>

<P>I do not share with some a fear of Fundamental Islam as a unifying
force which will change the political face of the globe. The
differences within the different factions of Islam are more than
enough to prevent such a single force operating in the next 30 years.
Nor do I support the views of Samuel Huntington who has written of a
clash of civilisations. Nevertheless, the hope of a global view of
the definition of individual rights and democracy will remain
difficult to formulate. We remain to an extent prisoners of the
present when thinking of the region. Thus we will worry about Iran
and Iraq, but it may be that there will emerge other personalities to
worry us. Egypt has a problem with fundamentalists, which it
currently contains, but at the price of slowing up economic reform.
Saudi Arabia is not without its potential difficulties. Nevertheless,
the practical man may take the approach that oil is only of value if
you can sell it.</P>

<P>But let me move on to the Asia Pacific region. Here we have two
questions to consider: first, and most importantly, where will China
be in 30 years time; and second what of the ASEAN nations? Again we
find ourselves trapped in extrapolations of what is happening at the
moment. We flip-flop from overoptimistic assumptions of prolonged
double digit growth to assuming that the current crisis may be the
end of the tiger economies. In 30 years, the region will be more
populous and more developed. it will be consuming more resources and
more power. It may or may not be peaceful, and China will be a much
more significant player in the world. All this suggests that there is
much to be said for engaging China and drawing it into the global
institutions such as the WTO. Japan is more difficult to assess. It
seems to be finding great difficulty in adapting fast enough to the
new global markets. Certainly the Japanese opinion formers are
acutely aware of the need for reform. A very senior official in Hong
kong last week painted a very black scenario for me in which a
collapse of Japan would not just bring chaos to the region but
beyond. Korea still has the possibility to surprise the world, and
perhaps not in a pleasant way. In this look at the future, we can
postulate either a unified Korea or a war devastated peninsular.
Either are possible. Nor is the Indian subcontinent's future assured.
There are good signs with the increase of high technology industry in
India, but it has not got its population problem under control. War
with Pakistan remains possible, but is perhaps less likely given that
it could have a nuclear dimension.</P>

<P>If we look at Africa, it is difficult to envisage any rapid answer
to the many problems of the continent. The triumph of the return to
democracy in South Africa, and also in Mozambique and Namibia gives
hope for a region of increasing stability and prosperity in the
South. Yet criminality could still undermine that, and it will be
many years before such potential prosperity would encompass Central
Africa. It seems likely that the world will have to help the
Continent throughout the next 30 years. Whether it will continue to
be willing to do so is another question. In South America, the move
away from military dictatorships to democracies has been a good
development over the past few years. There are some thriving
economies with great potential. Yet crime and corruption, often drug
related, remains a significant problem. Environmental issues are also
likely to cause tensions between the developed world and some South
American states.</P>

<P>Most important of all, what is the future for North America? The
world will be very different depending on whether the US becomes the
world's policeman or retreats into regional isolation. The
implications for the sort of investment we should make in security
depends critically on this issue. As I indicated earlier, while many
of the potential problems of today and tomorrow need a supranational
approach, there is also a tendency for power to move downward from
States to individuals. The widening recognition of the need to
protect human rights, the wish for ethnic groups to have self
determination, increasing access to information, increasing education
of women, and the ability of individuals to communicate globally, are
all pointers to a future where States may decline in power, and in
some cases even break up into smaller parts.</P>

<H3>Technology</H3>

<P>Having set the uncertainties of the future world as my backdrop,
let me t give you some thoughts onthe parallel problems of predicting
the implications of technology. In doing this I feel even more
circumspect than I do about predicting the state of the world. It is
a common perception that we are in a time of unprecedented rate of
technological change. In some respects this is obviously true, but I
think there are some important caveats to be made. At the end of the
last century, scientists were beginning to think they were within
sight of having an explanation for everything and an end to
discovery. Indeed scientific discovery and technological application
to industrial processes was remarkable then. There is perhaps a need
to introduce the concept of effective technology. Thus we have had
heavier than air flight for just short of a century, jet engines for
half that time. We have developed technology which allows us to fly
at supersonic speeds, but with a few exceptions, most air travel
continues to be at the same high subsonic speed that we have enjoyed
for the past 30 years. If you wish to improve transit times between
London and New York, a better return is achieved by speeding up the
process of getting from the centre of each city to the aircraft
before it takes off. Similarly the car has peaked in its effective
speed. We have just demonstrated that we have the technology for a
supersonic car, but the speed of traffic through cities is declining.
</P>

<P>None of this is to suggest a Luddite view of pure and applied
research. It is more to point to the disparity between the
extrapolation of the laboratory experiment to full scale production
in the sort of societies that we anticipate. I remember lecturing in
the 60s about the exciting possible future applications for Lasers.
While I might talk then about directed energy weapons, they have been
rather slow to be realised, and clever repairs to detached retinas,
which have happened but are hardly an everyday experience; it never
crossed my mind that every home today would have a laser in its
successor to the gramophone or every office one in its successor to
the typewriter. With all those health warnings, what are the
technologies which will affect security over the next 30 years? Time
will not allow me to do more than list them. They include: materials
science, nanotechnology, genetic engineering, medicine, novel
manufacturing techniques, non-lethal warfare, yet more in
communications and computing. The use of space will be a fruitful
area as well. We will cover others doubtless in discussion, but there
are many that we have yet to realise will be significant. I do
however believe that the trend away from defence being in the lead on
R&amp;D towards the greater exploitation of civil technologies will
continue increasingly. We need to concentrate defence research
resources in the few narrow fields where civil research will not
help.</P>

<H3>The Place of Military Power</H3>

<P>Let me draw a few conclusions for military power. There is
sufficient uncertainty in the immediate future to make it necessary
for any government to invest in providing for its citizens' security.
The more responsible, and wealthier, nations should also be prepared
to providing a contribution towards international stability even when
not directly threatened. That agenda will give rise to an
unquantifiable and potentially limitless military requirement.
Against the sorts of scenarios that i hinted at earlier, you could
build up any force requirement you wished, and we all know that this
has been the problem in defence planning since the end of the Cold
War. In the end, the investment will be cost limited in a fairly
arbitrary way. The figure for many nations is around the 2% of GDP
level.</P>

<H3>The Contribution of Air Power</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The airpower enthusiast will make the case for the special
contribution that air systems can make to so many of these future
operations. We shall doubtless cover many of them today, and the book
is also a wonderful source. I shall not therefore repeat them, but
take them as read. The question is whether for a resource constrained
nation where the direct threat is low, the attractions of high cost
air systems will be self evident. the numbers will inevitably be low,
and the support overheads proportionately higher.</P>

<H3>New Possibilities in New Worlds</H3>

<P>Let me float two possible futures for air power. Doubtless neither
will come to pass but perhaps they bound the range of possibilities.
First we can in the developed world continue on the current path. We
feel secure from major military threat, and we see our security
concerns as the results of crime, poverty and evironmental
degradation. Military forces continue to be useful to help diplomatic
effort, and do the emergency jobs that no-one else is willing to do.
When conflicts or other situations which require international
intervention occur, we will look to the UN for authority, and to the
US for capability. Over a period of time, those who wish to play will
have to follow the US lead in air power equipment and doctrine if
they are to be able to operate together. An increasing dependence on
both US presence and US defence industries will cause the other
nations to question even more whether they are wise to invest in
expensive air systems, which in any event are always just a part of a
bigger and better US force. They will tend to use their defence money
for the ground forces which will be needed in virtually every type of
operation, and can be made interoperable with the US at lower cost.
</P>

<P>The other end of spectrum of possibilities would be the thought
that it is time for air power to be procured, trained, and operated
at above the national level. Just as in the first world war it had
become too expensive and important to be left to the army and navy,
it may be that we are coming to a stage where this is true for
individual nations. We saw in NATO AWACs that for one particular
system, it was possible for nations to club together to deploy a very
expensive, high technology, key air power asset. It is strange that
the great burst towards multinational forces has been done with
ground formations. I know that our air forces operate together
routinely without any problem, but that is not the same. We had many
nationalities operating in the RAF in WW2. Air forces are uniquely
easy to operate on a multinational basis - the language of the air is
English, the procedures are international. Again, you will quote the
example of the French British, now European Air Group. This is
valuable but is not the answer. It retains all the individual
infrastructures.. If medium sized nations are to field air power
capabilities of significance, they will need to merge their research,
development, procurement, training, and operational capability. This
is quite an undertaking, but not impossible and would of course go
hand in hand with a stronger European defence aerospace industry and
a real ESDI.</P>

<H3>Conclusion</H3>

<P>I offered that slightly provocative option for the future of air
power outside the US, because I do not believe that we debate the
long term decline in capabilities often enough. It would be
politically difficult (particularly for the UK) to make air forces
operate at the supranational level, but if we are all planning to
carry out military operations at the supranational level, perhaps it
is time to think how we might make it come to pass.. One could
conceive of a european air force perhaps as a WEU force, It might be
quite fun to see decisions about WEU forces being made available to
NATO or the UN for a change.</P>

<P>But this is not a possibility for the immediate future - I just
offer it as an alternative model to the inevitable decline of
european air power capability in a world where military operations
are discretionary rather than compulsory. Air power has thrived on
adapting to new challenges and exploiting new opportunities, and
there are plenty of those in the new era. The excellent volume that
is the focus for today covers these issues - perhaps we need to be
thinking about ways in which Europe can operate its airpower on a
more equal basis with the United States.</P>
