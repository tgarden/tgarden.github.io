		<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">I have followed the missile defence debate
for over 20 years both within government and as an outside
commentator. I speak today as a commentator and certainly not giving
the British Government's position, but I shall try to describe what I
think has been going on in the UK policy debate. We can all
understand the immediate appeal to both military and civilian of the
thought that it might be possible to provide defences against such an
awful prospect as a nuclear or other WMD attack. The US has a long
and expensive history of attempting to provide itself with defences
against incoming ballistic missile attack. The first attempts of the
60's were abandoned when it became clear that such defences were
technically infeasible, and did no more than stimulate the Soviet
Union to increase the numbers of its nuclear tipped missiles. The
possibility of multiple warhead missiles made defences even less
reliable and reduced the stability of deterrence. In a wonderful
moment of rationality, the US and the Soviet Union agreed to the
Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty of 1972 which severely limited
the defensive system that each side could deploy. It was a treaty in
which not only both sides benefited from increased security, but the
world at large - and Europe in particular - applauded the reduced
impetus for a nuclear arms race. As technology improved, industry
again offered a vision of providing leakproof missile defences, and
President Reagan held out the prospect in a speech in 1983. The
Strategic Defence Initiative (SDI) spent billions of dollars, but
came no closer to providing a reliable defence against a nuclear
strikes.  The UK Government then feigned interest in the hope of
getting a share of the research funds, but was very sceptical about
feasibility.</FONT></P>
		<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">When I was invited  to Beijing in March of
this year to discuss the current proposals, I went back to some
articles I had written about SDI in 1983 and '84 to see what aspects
had changed since then, and so why I might support the new proposals.
My arguments against in the early 80s had been on technical ,
strategic, military effectiveness, financial and stability
grounds.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The new proposals for NMD draw on the SDI 
technologies but look to a much more limited requirement. The threat
to the continental United States is assumed to come from a "rogue
state" (sorry now called states of concern). These are normally
thought to include North Korea, Iran or Iraq. Each is expected to
have very few missiles capable of carrying weapons of mass
destruction over intercontinental distances. The technical problems
of interception are therefore expected to be much less. There is a
strong political consensus among Democrats and Republicans that NMD
should go ahead if it is technically possible. The system testing so
far has been ambiguous, and the third key interception test failed
badly. In Europe we have celebrated President Clinton's decision to
put off any decision until his successor is in post. So technical
capability may be better than it was, but is still uncertain. </FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The strategic implications are still much
the same as they were for SDI, despite the end of the Cold War and
the more limited declaratory aims. Many, and this is particularly
true in Europe, fear that undermining the ABM treaty will unpick all
the hard won achievements of arms control over the past 30 years. It
can be argued that if the US manages to renegotiate the treaty with
the Russians, there would be no such problem. Unfortunately, the
elements of the NMD system are not just minor changes to the treaty.
The thrust of the ABM treaty is to prohibit a nation-wide defensive
system. NMD also requires treaty-banned space-based sensors and
radars outside of the United States. The obvious response for
declared nuclear powers is to increase the number of nuclear systems
they field. For emerging powers they may decide it is better to go
less traditional routes with their WMD delivery systems. None of this
is helpful in promotion confidence and safety. There are also worries
about what the deployment of such a system would mean for NATO. If
the US had provided for itself a shield which was not available to
the rest of NATO, would this affect the internal alliance
relationships adversely? Of course we are assured by security
advisers to Governor Bush that any Republican scheme would provide
effective protection for Europe as well. The technical viability of
this extented system is even more suspect, the cost enormously
greater and there would be a transition period of perhaps years
before the system was extended. Europeans do not share the US view of
how to handle the threat of proliferation in difficult states. Nor do
they believe that a missile defensive system protects against the
many different types of threat that are now emerging. In some
respects the long range missile threat is the least likely and
nuclear deterrence remains a sufficient strategy. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The costs of NMD remain very high, and will
undoubtedly drain defence resources from other more urgent needs.
Some who worry about managing the sorts of conflicts we have been
involved in lately worry about the US focusing its defence
expenditure on the wrong priority. However in the end, the spending
issue is one for the US alone. If they wish to throw away more
trillions of dollars on a useless capability, that is really their
affair. We all do it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">On military effectiveness, it is difficult
to imagine a level of defensive assurance that will change the
approach the US takes in its dealing with difficult nations. Do we
really believe that a future President would be so confident of the
efficacy of an NMD system that he would ignore the potential risk of
an NMD strike? From a military perspective, the loss of money for
other capabilities is likely to be the more important aspect.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">However, despite these personal doubts,
which are shared by a wide body of opinion in and out of government
in Europe, what right have we Europeans to interfere in the internal
security arrangements of the United States? The answer of course is
that we fear that NMD will make the world a more dangerous place,
will reduce European security and in the UK give us some internal as
well external problems.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The particular policy problem for the UK
government is that two installations (Fylingdales radar station and
Menwith Hill) will both be integral parts of any US NMD system. The
necessary upgrades are likely to breach the ABM treaty unless it is
renegotiated. The UK has therefore some leverage with any US
administration. To preserve that leverage, it has doggedly stuck to a
formula that says " since the US has not requested upgrades as yet,
we have not addressed the policy". This is self-evidently nonsense,
but it does indicate the sensitivity of the UK politics that surround
NMD. Earlier this year, it looked as though the UK felt that its best
role might be to help to broker the best modified ABM treaty that it
could. This is not a role which would make many friends in the rest
of Europe. It would be seen as another example of the UK being more
with the US than with Europe. There are also domestic political
issues. It may prove difficult to explain why the UK is hosting two
key parts of an American defensive system, which in the first
instance provides no extra security to Britain. Indeed in any future
war, we might expect these facilities to be high priority for attack.
The Conservative party are well represented here today and will
doubtless give a more sympathetic view to US NMD aspirations. I see
this as a good issue in their constant battle against the rest of
Europe. They fully support NMD and want the UK to offer what is
necessary. The minority opposition party of the Liberal Democrats
want the UK to oppose NMD and look to strengthening ties with Europe
and bolstering the arms control regime. We have therefore a
potentially divisive poltical issue if the new administration moves
quickly on the UK participation in any NMD scheme. For now the
Government has quietly celebrated the failure of the critical test,
and President Clinton's deferment of the decision.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">What should the rest of the world do? After
all, every American you talk with says that NMD is a done deal. No
politician would speak against it - any more than they would speak
against the death penalty. A move which is likely to result in a less
safe world in general, and a less safe Britain in particular, for no
advantage is one in which Britain and Europe have a legitimate
interest. Perhaps there is now a Common Foreign and Security Policy
interest for Europe which is not shared by the United States, and
Europe needs to stand up for itself. There might be merit in
encouraging a more evolutionary approach toward missile defences for
deployed military formations. These would be technically more likely
to work, cost less and have a reasonable rationale.</FONT></P>
