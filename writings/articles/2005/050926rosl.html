			<h3><b>Forecasting the Future</b></h3>
			<p>Forecasting what the world is going to be like in this new century is an uncertain art. Unfortunately, crises, both natural and manmade, emerge so rapidly that predictions are upset almost as soon as they are made. Predicting the future is always a somewhat hazardous affair. We extrapolate from recent experience into the unknown, often coming to quite incorrect conclusions.&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>A New Approach to World Security</h3>
			<p>The 1990s were an interesting decade. The end of the Cold War, the reunification of Germany, the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union, and the accession last year of Poland, Czech Republic and Hungary into NATO have completely transformed Europe's security. It looked as though we were managing the security risk down from a high to a low level.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;Many had hoped that the new millennium would bring a much greater emphasis on human and individual rights by the major democratic powers. But the attacks on the Washington and New York on 11 September have changed the direction of our approach to security once more. Whether this is a short or long term change is difficult to see. Certainly at this stage the implications of the intervention in Iraq in March 2003 seem to have raised the global security risks, rather than reduced them as the proponents for military action expected.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;If we are to reduce the risks of conflict and prevent it or resolve it, we need to look at the causes. For security is not just about military and diplomatic activity.</p>
			<h3><b>&nbsp;Environment, Resources &amp; Energy</b></h3>
			<p>Environmental issues are major challenges for this century. Some like the Tsunami we can only prepare to manage the consequences, others like global warming, we seem unable to control. We have seen the US isolated over Kyoto, but there remains the problem of what to do about the rapidly developing parts of the world like China and India. Global warming will affect available land in places like Bangladesh, or cause unexpected disasters in Mozambique. Even the developed world is experiencing costly weather disasters with much greater frequency as we have seen so graphically in this hurricane season. It may affect food availability in developing countries more adversely. Pollution of air or water can become a threat to neighbours.</p>
			<p>Availability of fresh water is another growing cause of friction between states. The forest fires of Indonesia hardly help relations with its neighbours, but may also have wider implications for the atmosphere - as is of course also the case with the Brazilian rain forests. We have seen that industrial fishing can take fish stocks below the level of viability. The Labrador fisheries are now dead. Again this can be a source for conflict. &nbsp;The intensity of commercial operations, the need for fresh water, the growing populations and the need to raise living standards are problems which come together across much of the poorer parts of the world, and in which Europe feels it has an interest.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;It will not be possible for the rich nations to hold back the aspirations of the poor nations. Yet the consequences in terms of just energy requirements are of great concern. We shall need to look at ways of providing the necessary energy without the burning of carbon - and that probably means a renaissance of nuclear energy, which brings with another series of potential problems, not least in terms of the availability of the necessary materials for nuclear weapons.</p>
			<h3>Economics &amp; Security&nbsp;</h3>
			<p>&nbsp;Global markets give a global interdependence. Again economists are still arguing whether this gives the global economy a new robustness or a new vulnerability. The rapid recovery of the Asian markets were seen as a sign of the benefits of global markets - but there are those that would argue that the rapid recovery slowed the market reforms that were needed in Asia in general, and Japan in particular, thus setting the world up for a deeper depression when the next fall comes. What no one disputes is the importance of Asian economies to the rest of the world's markets.</p>
			<p>In particular, the rapid economic growth of China is a key factor to how the world will develop this century. The ripples of China as an international economic competitor are being seen in the US and Europe. Whether economic success is followed by growing military aspirations will also be a concern.</p>
			<p>The moves we are making in Europe towards an integrated economic structure are another model to become a big league player in the world. It is difficult currently to forecast whether the EU will become a force in areas other than trade. We are in one our periodic crises about where the Unionis going. However, it could become a model for other regional groupings in the world.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3><b>Population Growth</b></h3>
			<p>India passed the one billion people mark sometime in August 1999. Together with China, it represents a third of the world's population. Growth rates are declining everywhere, yet for the developing world they remain positive. The world's population looks set to stabilise and even start to decline by the end of this century, but in the meantime there will have been some significant demographic changes. India will probably become the most populous country around 2030.</p>
			<p>The European countries may be having a different sort of population crisis if they continue to have negative growth rates. The divide between rich and poor states may be magnified by these differential population growth rates. All of these strains may be further exacerbated by environmental problems. Economic refugees as well as political refugees are already a serious security issue for many countries.&nbsp; Refugees are an emotional political issue in most Western European countries today. &nbsp;</p>
			<h3>Disease - Natural and Man-made</h3>
			<p>We should also worry about the global implications of disease. We may have passed through a relatively golden age in the 20th century in terms of the tools to fight disease. Aids and TB are taking their toll. Malaria areas will increase with global warming. The current major global concern is an influenza pandemic, perhaps caused by the mutation of avian flu to a human form. This would result in millions of deaths world wide, spread by global travel.</p>
			<p>This would be reason for concern enough, but to it we must add the growing perception of biological weapons as the poor man's nuclear bomb. Even in the old fashioned anthrax aerosol, this prospect is a serious concern, as the US has experienced with what was a relatively small scale attack. If you add the prospect of genetic modification to the design of biological warfare, you have a very bleak prospect for the future. It would however be fair to say, it is one which Europe would prefer to deal with through arms control measures rather than greater military expenditure. A rigorous CWC and BWC regime is the European way, but not perhaps attractive to the US.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>Weapons of Mass Destruction</h3>
			<p>We rightly feel much less at risk from nuclear weapons today than we did through the Cold War period. It is certainly true that there are far fewer nuclear warheads now than there were in the 1980s. But there are still an enormous number held by the US and Russia. Russia is a particular problem, it is by no means clear that control of the tactical nuclear weapon arsenal can be maintained. The agreement signed by President Bush and President Putin is a good thing in terms of perception, but does not necessarily make us safer.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;India and Pakistan have been nuclear weapon states for a long time, but neither had previously felt it necessary to declare themselves as such. The optimist would argue that they have improved deterrence by their tests; the pessimists would say that they are their systems are not well controlled and a nuclear war has become more likely. Certainly we have seen them in a dangerous confrontation this year, and the problem remains. North Korea has been working hard to achieve a nuclear capability. It has almost certainly a biological and chemical capability, and the targets in South Korea are not difficult to reach.</p>
			<p>The current focus is on Iran, which seems to be persuing a nuclear option. The recent conference on the nuclear non proliferation treaty was a failure, and it looks increasingly likely that nuclear aspirations will be the cause of conflicts in the future.&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>Conflict Risk Areas</h3>
			<p>What are the problems as we speak? How can we tackle them? The most obvious is perhaps Israel/Palestine. A satisfactory solution is fairly self-evident: two co-operating independent viable States. Israel must give up its settlements in the Occupied Territories. Palestine must give up its demands for the right of return of refugees to Israel territory. Jersualem should be administered as an international city. At various times over the past decade, progress has been made towards this sort of model. Conflict prevention is all about diplomatic effort, negotiating and compromise.&nbsp; Despite the expressions of hope from world leaders that there are new post Arafat opportunities for progress, the prospects are not good.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;Iraq is a worsening problem. It matters not where any of us were over the original intervention, it is now clearly a security risk to its own people, the region and through terrorism to the wider world. It also serves as an illustration of how wrong risk assessments can be in this area. That serious strategic planners in the US and the UK could have failed to take precautions against the post war collapse into chaos is a matter for great concern. If as seems likely, the security situation in the country continues to worsen, there will be some very difficult decisions to be made about the role of international forces there. Do they remain, but in doing so act as a catalyst for insurgency, or go and risk civil war? Given the poor judgment shown up to now, it is difficult to feel much confidence.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;Afghanistan is an example of what happens when you change a regime through modern military action. We now have a problem to ensure that it can grow into a form of democracy which can feed itself. If we do not give help in the form of security and aid, we will have another problem of a failed state.</p>
			<p>India and Pakistan, I have already spoken about. But the problem has not gone away. Diplomatic effort is complicated by the role Pakistan has to play in the war on terrorism. Again the most important cause is about the ownership of occupied territory, in this case Kashmir. Again in the long run diplomacy is the answer.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;Africa is full of many conflicts and other ills, and was rightly the focus for the G8 summit. It is also a useful reminder that other methods such as the global Live 8 concerts can raise awareness.&nbsp; They are often forgotten by the world, but the rich nations need to work at stabilising much of the continent. We worry about the perhaps 150,000 deaths from the tsunami; and the maybe 50,000 Iraqis killed since our intervention; but in Darfur these numbers are exceeded and in the Congo the prospects are still very bad for yet more mass killings. The problems are different in different parts of Africa, but stem from poverty, disease and corruption. Managing the risks in Africa remains patchy and inadequate.</p>
			<p>Taiwan remains an unresolved global security issue.</p>
			<h3>Terrorism</h3>
			<p>Finally,in Europe and the US, the new form of international terrorism is the overwhelming security concern of the moment. It is a form of conflict which has bubbled up around the world for centuries. Modern society makes new vulnerable targets for terrorist acts. The conflicts which I have been talking about can sow the seeds which lead to terrorist activity. The key area of difference between Europe and the US is on the balance between the effectiveness of short term military action against longer term strategies to resolve conflicts which lead to terrorism. Keeping a sense of proportion about the risks from international terrorism is difficult for democracies. Yet the numbers killed in global terms are really very small. What is a worry is the small but finite risk of suicidal fanatical terrorism coupled with mass destruction techniques.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>The decline in the power of States&nbsp;</h3>
			<p>So is the future to be all fear and no hope? For addressing most of these global security problems, individual States are no longer able to act alone. The United Nations is a wonderful ideal, but is much hampered in practice. It is going through a bad patch at the moment. Work is needed to make it better able to meet its obligations. Regional groupings should be effective in dealing with local troubles. Of these groupings, the EU is the most mature, but lacks a coherent foreign and security policy. If it were to develop one, and the diplomatic and military tools to underpin such a policy, it could be a very powerful agent for stability. Even so the EU through enlargement has brought peace and democracy to a large geographical region. Managing risk through conflict prevention is always more predictable, less costly and to be preferred.&nbsp;</p>
			<h3><b>Hopes or Fears</b></h3>
			<p>&nbsp;Despite the best efforts of the international community to promote multicultural liberal democracies, we seem to be developing a move towards rights for ethnic, religious or cultural self determination, whether in the former Yugoslavia or in East Timor. If this proves to be the case, there will be a long queue of disputes, with the Kurds near the top, particularly if Iraq descends into civil war. Africa is still riven by civil warfare and ethnic cleansing of the worst kind, and suffers from most of the other troubles that I touched on: poor economy, high population growth rates, disease, famine and corruption.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>There are nevertheless many hopeful signs as we enter the new century. The Cold War has ended. Despite the fears of terrorism, we in the West live in greater security than ever before. Economies may fluctuate, but the global economy grows. Technology is allowing individuals access to more information than ever before, and the ability to operate on a global basis. International Law is beginning to bring pressure to bear on abusers of human rights. Population growth is declining in the longer term. Environmental issues are recognised if not yet effectively addressed.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;There are great reasons to be cautiously optimistic for the prospects of greater peace and prosperity in the 21st Century, but only if people and their governments face up to their global responsibilities. The dangers are real and many if nations are fixed only on their own self interest. In Europe, we at last seem to be starting to face up to our responsibilities as a region which is both wealthier and more populous than the United States, and we need to take on a more equitable share of the global security burden. Managing risk in international security is not a game, the future safety of people around the world depends on it.</p>
