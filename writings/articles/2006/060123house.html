			<h3><b>Thursday 12<sup>th</sup>&nbsp; January</b></h3>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The week starts with a question about the Reserves.&nbsp; Lord Drayson seems unaware that the MOD has already announced a &quot;rebalancing&quot; exercise &#150; and our exchange is more than usually unsatisfactory.&nbsp; I point out the discrepancy to him as I set off to Waterloo for the Eurostar and Paris. My papers and magazines are all full of Lib Dem leadership analysis, but at least I am safe from colleagues selling the merits of their favoured candidate.&nbsp; I am used to the routine of the EU Security Studies Institute, and have left myself&nbsp; 20 minutes to turn round and get the Metro for dinner, where I catch up with old friends from both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3><b>Friday 13<sup>th</sup> January</b></h3>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>I am speaking in the opening session of this seminar on EU-US burdensharing. An old friend and&nbsp; former US Ambassador, makes the rational case for a renewal of the transatlantic partnership. For much of the rest of the day, we Europeans list the problems.&nbsp; But in the end, everyone agrees that what is lacking is leadership on both sides of the Atlantic. Lunch is disrupted by the BBC wanting me to discuss the possibility of&nbsp; a Forces' Federation. Radio Scotland catches me on the mobile in a bar near the Gare du Nord over half a dozen oysters. I am back to Hampstead by 10pm.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3><b>Saturday 14<sup>th</sup> January</b></h3>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Sue and I are up early to get to the LSE for the first hustings of the leadership contest. Seated between activists from Totnes and Stockport, I was able to take a small&nbsp; sample of national opinion. The set speeches from the candidates were followed by a serious academic analysis of what qualities are needed for success. I&nbsp; buttonhole Simon Hughes on the way out to offer my help to his campaign.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3><b>Sunday 15<sup>th</sup> January</b></h3>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Happily, I can use today to catch up on the post, diary bookings and e-mail.&nbsp; I have 3 speeches to work on for the week ahead. However, I manage to make time to explore new software that has just arrived for my&nbsp; Apple Mac. Sue is out for most of the day at the Federal Conference Committee, leaving me to have a video conference chat with the grandchildren. Henry, aged 5, interviews me on my favourite toys of 50 years ago for his school project. In the evening we hop on the bus up to a Hampstead Garden Suburb fundraising party and sample grassroots' opinion on the leadership battle.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3><b>Monday 16<sup>th</sup> January</b></h3>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>I watch the ID Cards debate and help to defeat the Government by a massive majority. Media calls range from Rolls-Royce engines for JSF to where we are going on the Iran nuclear problem. Between votes, I am over to Portcullis House for the weekly Defence Team meeting in Mike Moore's office.&nbsp; A race back for the second vote, and then time for some discussions about the leadership with colleagues in the Bishops&rsquo; Bar. Back home for a rerun of the leadership hustings on Sky. My man seems to be performing well.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3><b>Tuesday 15<sup>th</sup> January</b></h3>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>At our Foreign Affairs Team meeting. we discuss Iraq, Afghanistan and Israel developments.&nbsp; From there, I slip into the defence select committee on Afghanistan. Feeling guilty, I dart up to King's College to show that I really still need an office and clear my jammed pigeon hole. Back to the House for an interview for Services' TV.&nbsp; A couple of votes before going to the House of Lord's Defence Group to hear the Chief of &nbsp;the General Staff. Over dinner, Mike Jackson and I reflect that it is exactly 30 years since we started the army staff course together.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3><b>Wednesday 16<sup>th</sup> January</b></h3>
			<p>Another early start with the Delegated Powers Committee in the morning, followed by the weekly Lib Dem Peers meeting. After lunch, I come in on questions on Afghanistan.&nbsp; Later, I use the prospective Afghan deployment to tell the Constitution Committee&nbsp; why Parliament should have the final say about such adventures. Some of the other senior military witnesses&nbsp; take a more traditional view &#150; but it was ever thus when we worked together in the past. The diary week ends with one evening to catch up with the Tivo recordings &#150; and to reflect that it was an unusual week &#150; but then every week in the Lords is unique.</p>
