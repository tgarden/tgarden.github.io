<h3>Growing Apart</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><b><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></b></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Both the
European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation draw their roots from
the rebuilding of Western Europe, after the devastation of the continent in the
Second World War, in a way designed to prevent war from happening again. The EU
can trace its origins directly from the Treaty of Paris in 1951 which brought
into being the European Coal and Steel Community with France, West Germany,
Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands as the founding members.
Although coal and steel were vital to economic recovery, they were also seen as
essential industries for the waging of war. Robert Schuman, the French Foreign
Minister in 1950, had proposed the pooling of these industries to make war
between the signatory states ìnot only unthinkable but materially impossibleî. <a
style='mso-endnote-id:edn1' href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[1]<![endif]></span></span></a>
The United States had an important part to play as the provider of economic aid
to Europe through the Marshall Plan. The management of this aid was much more
effective through the common policy approach engendered by the ECSC.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If the Paris
Treaty laid the foundations of security within Western Europe, the Brussels
Treaty of 1948 looked to provide collective security against the external
threat posed by the Soviet Union. Belgium, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands
and the United Kingdom pledged to build up a common defence system and to
strengthen their economic and cultural ties. From this beginning grew the
Western European Union. More importantly, the following year saw the United
States taking the lead in a new collective security arrangement through the
North Atlantic Treaty. The Brussels Treaty signatories were joined by the US,
Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Italy, Norway and Portugal to form NATO.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In the subsequent
half century, the Paris, Brussels and Washington Treaties increased their
memberships, developed their aims and to an extent grew apart despite their
shared members and common interests. By the end of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century,
the six members of the ECSC had become the fifteen of the European Union. Most
of the first 50 years had been focused on economic, political, social and
cultural issues. The original vision of making war impossible between member
states had been successful. Occasional bursts of enthusiasm for providing for
external security needs had failed, given the perceived importance of keeping
the United States engaged in Europe. The Western European Union was for much of
its history overshadowed by NATO, but it had grown to 10 full members (all members
of both the EU and NATO), with a growing collection of European states linked
as observers and associates. NATO, despite the disappearance of the Soviet
Union, had continued to thrive as a political-military organisation and had
increased to 19 full members with links to a growing number of<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>partner nations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The question
looking forward to the next 50 years is whether NATO and the EU can co-operate
in their overlapping remits in the field of security. The nature of security is
changing following the end of the Cold War. Perceptions of threats and
interests have differed on either side of the Atlantic, although the terrorist
attacks on New York and Washington on 11 September 2001 may close that
perceptual gap. Before the attacks, there were increasing signs that the United
States was adopting a foreign policy that was more exclusively focused on its
national interests. At the same time the Europeans were becoming more confident
of their economic and political weight in the international forum, and developing
a perception of their own regional interests. The relationship between the US
and the other NATO members has been in the past an unequal one. Most of Europe
has welcomed the American leadership in NATO for most of the time; but this may
be changing. While there is no wish by Europeans (or Americans) to dispense
with NATO, there are devlopments which may make it less relevant and less
useful in the future. This paper looks at the factors which may make
relationships between the EU and NATO more difficult, considers whether it
matters in the longer term, and suggests the options that may be available for
the member nations of both organisations if they wish to promote international
security. At the time of writing, it is too early to make a judgement on the
long term effect of the growing international coalition against terrorism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h3>European Security after the Cold War</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><b><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></b></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The rapid
collapse of the threat from the Soviet Union after the fall of the Berlin Wall
in 1989 was a challenge to the rationale for NATO. <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>Yet a succession of crises in the 1990s breathed new life
into the organisation. Although the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq in August 1990
was well outside the area covered by the North Atlantic Treaty, the UN authorised
military response, led by the USA, was very much an operation which drew on
NATO expertise. The formations, equipment, training and doctrine from years of
NATO Cold War exercises meant that it was possible to deploy an effective
multinational military force to expel the invaders from Kuwait. <span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Following the Gulf War, a series of
crises on the edge of NATO territory emerged as the Former Republic of
Yugoslavia disintegrated. In Bosnia, NATO was directly called upon to police an
agreed peace. That peace, brokered at Dayton, was essentially a US formula for
settlement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In 1999, NATO
undertook a major military operation to save Albanian ethnic people in Kosovo
from human rights abuse by Serbia. Again the timing, style and tactics of the
air operation were driven largely by US policy makers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Not only was
NATO finding itself being called upon for more operations than it had ever
untertaken in the days of the Cold War, it was also serving new political
needs. The emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe looked to NATO to
provide them with security from any Russian threat, and also as a badge of
membership of an association of western democracies. The NATO member states saw
the organisation as a vehicle for reforming the newly freed states, for
bringing them into the European security arrangement, and for preventing
conflict. In 1999, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland became new members
with the promise of more to follow in the future. The choice of these three
countries for membership owed much to US domestic political considerations<a
style='mso-endnote-id:edn2' href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[2]<![endif]></span></span></a>.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Thus by the end
of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century, NATO had reinvented itself. Although the
original Washington Treaty rationale as a collective security organisation
remained, it had been used by its members to intervene, even without direct UN
authorisation, to take in new democracies, and to provide the basis for
coalitions to carry out operations far from the territory of Western Europe.
Much discussion had taken place before the start of the Kosovo operation about
whether NATO could be used for intervention without a UN mandate. The Europeans
were uncomfortable with an explicit statement of such a possibility. NATO had
formalised the end of the Cold War with a new strategic concept in 1991, but
this was much revised in a further version agreed in 1999 to coincide with
NATOís 50<sup>th</sup> birthday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The final bullet
of the Strategic Concept recognised the parallel post Cold War development
which had been taking place within the European Union. While there had been
previous attempts to strengthen the foreign and security policy capabilities of
the EU, little progress was made until 1998. The Maastricht Treaty<a
style='mso-endnote-id:edn4' href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[4]<![endif]></span></span></a>,
which entered force in 1993, had set up the arrangements for a Common Foreign
and Security Policy (CFSP). The CFSP was to include all questions related to
the security of the EU, including the progressive framing of a common defence
policy. It foresaw the possibility of a common defence if the European Council
should so decide. The Western European Union was to be the executive arm of the
CFSP. However, in practice, little in terms of practical military capability
was generated since the WEU was so dependent on NATO for any real operational
forces. This suited the UK very well until 1998, as successive governments were
concerned that development of European defence would be at the expense of NATO.
As the 1999 Strategic Concept made clear, improvements in European capabilities
were to be welcomed, but they were seen by the US to be in the context of
improved contributions to NATO.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In the immediate
aftermath of the 1997 UK General Election, the new Labour government gave every
impression that it would continue the transatlantic focus to defence policy
that had been pursued so assiduously by all its post-war predecessors. The
Strategic Defence Review (SDR)<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn5' href="#_edn5"
name="_ednref5" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[5]<![endif]></span></span></a>
took this as its foreign policy assumption, and had little to say about deeper
European co-operation on defence matters. The promotion of the Western European
Union (WEU) as a safety valve for any schemes for wider European military
ambitions was retained as a UK policy aim. Yet no sooner was the SDR published
than a new approach to European defence was formulated in the inner circles of<span

The increasing enthusiasm for producing a better EU defence posture can be
tracked through a series of summit meetings. In October 1998 at Prtschach, the
UK Prime Minister,Tony Blair, indicated that the UK would be prepared to consider
military co-operation within the EU. The December 1998 Franco-British summit at
St Malo provided the real breakthrough with proposals for improved EU defence
capabilities, and the requirement for Europe to have &quot;the capacity for
autonomous action&quot;. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The last year of
the Twentieth Century was momentous in western defence terms. The air campaign
in Kosovo demonstrated in graphic terms the enormous imbalance between US and
European capabilities.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn7' href="#_edn7"

Decisions over the bombing tactics or ground force options reminded European
leaders of their dependence on American policy as well as firepower. Kosovo as
a lesson in power politics provided another impetus to the work on European
Defence Policy. The Cologne Council of June 1999 transformed the various bi-lateral
initiatives into an EU process. The leaders decided to set up the necessary
institutional arrangements for the EU to deal with defence. This included an
agreement to transfer WEU assets to the EU by the end of the following year.
The new post of High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy
(CFSP) was agreed and it was filled by the former NATO Secretary General,
Javier Solana, in the autumn. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The culmination
of all this activity was the Helsinki European Council of 11-12 December 1999.
After the important philosophical and institutional groundwork had been done at
the previous meetings, Helsinki was to produce concrete military capability
proposals. The member states set themselves a &quot;headline goal&quot;. They
looked to develop an EU force which would be capable of carrying out corps
level (about 50-60,000 troops) tasks. These tasks would include the most
demanding of peacekeeping, humanitarian and crisis management, but NATO would
remain the vehicle for territorial defence requirements. Rightly, the Helsinki
goal spells out the supporting requirements for such an independent power
projection force. It needs command and control, intelligence, logistics, combat
support, and the necessary air and naval elements. It has to be able to be
deployed within 60 days and self sustaining for a year. All of this is to be
achieved by 2003. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Once the
Helsinki aim was agreed, the work transferred largely from the political
process to the bureaucratic. Defence ministries have had to look at how they
can tailor their capabilities to fit the new requirement. The focus for this
effort was the Capabilities Commitment Conference hosted by France at the end
of November 2000. In order to list the capabilities needed, scenarios had to be
agreed. These included the possibility of having to conduct the separation of
warring factions by force, humanitarian assistance and evacuation of civilians,
and conflict prevention operations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

military structure of NATO, and Denmark has opted out of the EU defence

countries want greater security through membership of NATO, and greater

members of both organisations there are a number of pluses and minuses with
enlargement. A bigger EU means a bigger market and in theory greater wealth.
However for those nations which currently benefit from EU financial help, they
worry that they will become net contributors as their poorer cousins to the
East come in. They also worry about the need to reform the common agriculture
policy, the risk of large scale labour movement, and the difficulties of
decision making in. The Nice Summit of December 2000 was supposed to accelerate
the EU enlargement process. Another 12 prospective members (Cyprus, Hungary,
Poland, Estonia, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Malta, Bulgaria, Romania, Latvia,
Lithuania, Slovakia and Turkey ) were given new hope that their membership
would be seriously advanced. The list of applicants will take many years to

Slovenia had too few friends pushing their case. Romania had a passionate
advocate in France, but could not carry the rest of the members against the
wish of the US. The next formal consideration of possible new members will take
place at the NATO summit in Prague in November 2002. However, the political
jostling has already started. There has been some uncertainty as to what the US

Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania will probably cause no problems to the rest of
Europe, the position of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia may be more contentious.
The three Baltic republics are an area of great sensitivity for Russia. NATO
remains in the Russian public mind from the days of Cold War confrontation as a
potential hostile force, and an enlargement into the Baltic republics will be
difficult to accept. Beyond the reaction of Russia, there are concerns about
the progressive weakening of NATO as a military organisation, and also a worry
about achieving consensus among so many nations. The one area that needs both
economic and political development is the Balkans. At some stage both the EU
and NATO are going to have address how to handle enlargement in this direction.

While the Helsinki process has drawn on a number of possible scenarios, there
remains a degree of uncertainty over divisions of tasks between NATO and the

wider remit than just the Article 5 of the Washington Treaty undertaking for
the collective defence of member nationsí territory. NATO may now find itself
operating as an international agent of the UN or even on its membersí<span

transatlantic agreement about the nature of security threats for the future.

military capability Europe has is likely to be used either in dealing with
internecine conflict inside Europe, most likely in the Balkans, or in
peace-making and peacekeeping outside Europe. The US may want to leave conflict
inside Europe to the Europeans. They will certainly look to Europe for support
when they become militarily engaged outside the Americas. As for the Europeans,
operations they might expect to have to mount will include humanitarian relief,
promoting the rule of law, and rescue of EU civilians. Any<span

sufficiently grave to warrant the despatch of an expeditionary force for
possible warfighting will attract the interest of the US; and that US interest,

because Europe is perceived as able and willing to deploy a military capability

It may be that public fear about fanatical terrorists will change the political
climate on defence spending, but this is by no means a given.There are some
common features to these funding difficulties, but there are also differences
stemming from significant differences in overall strategy. </span><span
style='font-family:Times;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Defence spending can be
broadly divided into three main parts: personnel costs, equipment costs and
running costs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Personnel costs
closely follow civilian wage costs. In time of full employment,they may need to
run ahead of their civilian comparators given the many disadvantages of service
life. Even in time of unemployment, there is little evidence that the services
can underpay and retain their people. Increasingly the type of manpower that is
needed within the services is becoming more technically able, and thus even
more expensive. Wage costs usually rise at or above inflation.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The military, particularly the army, is
a labour intensive industry and we must therefore expect the personnel slice of
the budget to rise in real terms year on year. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Body><span style='font-family:Times;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Body><span style='font-family:Times;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>The cost
of military equipment is also large. Price changes of defence equipment are
more complicated to analyse than the rise in manpower costs. The life
expectancy of a particular item is often a matter of choice, and may be
determined by budgetary pressures. Some equipments may cost very much more than
their predecessors, but fewer of them may be required to do the task. Defence
programmers have had to balance their budgets by reducing the fleet size with
each new generation of equipment. This causes an uncomfortable rise in the
relative support costs of fleets as smaller frontlines still require the full
range of maintenance, logistic and training infrastructure to sustain
them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Planners use a similar
technique for weapon stockpiles. Weapon costs show a high cost rise with each
new generation. There is a temptation to keep the old stock and bring in the
new weapon more slowly. In the case of both weapons and platforms, the reducing
numbers of units procured further forces the unit price higher still as
research and development costs have to be recovered over smaller buys. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Body><span style='font-family:Times;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>The third
sector for defence spending includes the costs of maintaining the support for
the armed forces. Most running costs will be fairly closely aligned to normal
inflation in the economy. Fuel, accommodation, food, transport, maintenance and
logistics support activities have no reason to be out of line with inflationary
pressures more generally. Indeed there are often opportunities to undertake
some of these activities in ways that take them out of some of the extra costs
incurred by military operations. Contractorised, civilianised and out-sourced
support should be sustainable with level funding in real terms. In a time of
declining forces, it is possible to realise some of the value of the defence
estate by selling off land. Short term spending regulation is also possible by
reducing the activity levels of forces, and this has historically often been
used to compensate for rising costs elsewhere in the defence programme. If used
too extensively such measures affect both combat capability and personnel
retention. These lead to steeply rising costs in later years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Body><span style='font-family:Times;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Therefore
all defence programmes suffer an inflationary problem. Personnel costs rise at
a rate slightly above inflation; equipment costs rise much faster than retail
price inflation; and running costs rise broadly in line with inflation. The
combined effect is that level defence spending in real terms inevitably leads
to decreases in force levels year on year. In fact, level funding in real terms
has been the exception since the 1980s in both US and European budgets.The 1986

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The difference
in approach to security planning between the US and Europe is at its starkest
over the question of defences against long range ballistic missiles. The United
States has for nearly half a century looked longingly at the possibility of affording
itself protection through technology. The latest US proposals for Missile
Defence (MD) draw on the Strategic Defence Initiative (SDI) technologies
supported by president Reagan in the 1980s, but look to a much more limited
requirement. The threat to the continental United States is assumed to come
from a state which does not react to normal deterrence. Such states are
normally thought to include North Korea, Iran or Iraq. Each is expected to have
very few missiles capable of carrying weapons of mass destruction over
intercontinental distances. The technical problems of interception are
therefore expected to be much less. Until recently, there has been a degree of
political consensus among Democrats and Republicans that MD should go ahead if<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>it is technically possible. The system
testing so far has been ambiguous as to its likely technical feasibility. The
use of civil airliners taken over by terrorists using low technology knives
ought to indicate a change in approach; but it may merely re-inforce those who
wish to cover every possible threat to the USA. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The strategic
implications are still much the same as they were for SDI, despite the end of
the Cold War and the more limited declaratory aims. Many in Europe fear that
undermining the ABM treaty will unpick all the hard won achievements of arms
control over the past 30 years. It can be argued that if the US manages to
renegotiate the treaty with the Russians, there would be no such problem.
Unfortunately, the elements of the MD system are not just minor changes to the
treaty. The<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>ABM treaty is designed
to prohibit a nation-wide defensive system. MD also requires treaty-banned
space-based sensors and radars outside of the United States. The likely response
for declared nuclear powers is to increase the number of nuclear systems they
field. For emerging powers they may decide it is better to go less traditional
routes with their WMD delivery systems. In Europe this is seen as unhelpful in
promotion confidence and safety. There are also worries about what the
deployment of such a system would mean for NATO. If the US had provided for
itself a shield which was not available to the rest of NATO, would this affect
the internal alliance relationships adversely?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

a deployment which would provide effective protection for Europe as well. The
technical viability of this extended system is even more questionable, the cost
enormously greater and there would be a transition period of perhaps years
before the system could be extended. Europeans do not share the US view of how
to handle the threat of proliferation in difficult states. Nor do they believe
that a missile defensive system protects against the many different types of
threat that are now emerging. The long range missile threat is less
urgent,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>and nuclear deterrence
remains a sufficient strategy. The costs of MD remain very high, and will
undoubtedly drain defence resources from other more urgent needs. Even the US
will have to make funding choices, and this may make it even less willing to
commit forces to the peacekeeping tasks which the Europeans favour.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The European
approach to defence priorities is much more piecemeal. This largely reflects
the distinct differences between different national capabilities. Still, more
than a decade after the end of the Cold War, the types of forces reflect the
long necessity of fielding relatively static defensive forces to deter attack
by the Soviet Union. Germany has a large army, and finds it politically
difficult to dispense with conscription. It has focused its security spending
on the costs of reunification, which have been very large. It therefore feels
that it is unfairly criticised for its slowness in military reform. Both the UK
and France see themselves as the serious military powers within Europe. They
were better structured for the new deployable roles given their experience of
global operations. Nevertheless, both are finding it difficult to provide the
resources for their restructured and smaller forces. The smaller European
countries are having to share their military forces to provide sustainable
capabilities. The Netherlands and Belgium have established a single common
naval headquarters and share the maritime tasks as if they were a single
entity. A group of Nordic nations are providing a shared logistics capability
for support of their forces in the Balkans. The Netherlands has provided
financial support to Germany in return for a share of the German air transport
tasking. Even the major players are now looking at more efficient ways of
sharing their scarce assets to provide cover for contingencies. In the
counter-terrorist sphere, many European nations are better prepared than the
USA because of their battles against domestic terrorism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Despite a ready
recognition within European governments that the US carries a disproportionate
load within NATO, there is no indication that any nation intends to raise its
defence spending significantly. What enthusiasm there is for defence is
concentrated on trying to do better with what is available now. The struggles
to produce anything that might be a new capability through the Helsinki
headline goal process shows how difficult this is proving. The perception in
the US that Europe is wasting its all too feeble defence resources on a
pointless EU defence bureaucracy is another source for EU/NATO divisions. Yet
there is also a growing sense of irritation in Europe at the lack of
investment, both political and financial, by the US in non-military activities
to promote international security.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

This is seen by European nations as an important element of promoting
international stability and conflict prevention. In the UK, a conflict
prevention budget is being formed to be shared between the work of Defence,
Foreign Affairs and International Development ministries. This is an indication
that the UK has recognised that non-military solutions must be considered in a
strategy for conflict prevention just as much as military ones. While the
military budget for the NATO nations is an order of magnitude greater than

disparity between the approach adopted in Europe towards the role of
non-military international institutions and that adopted by the United States.
EU states have grown used to the advantages gained by surrendering some
national sovereignty within the Union in order to derive mutual benefits. They
see the possibility of similar benefits from global structures. The United
Nations is recognised as an imperfect institution, but Europe is enthusiastic
to make it work better. The UN has a key role to play in international
security, but is often hampered by the politics of the Security Council. The US
is widely perceived in Europe as less than helpful in supporting the work of the
UN. This is at its most obvious in the long standing reluctance of the US to
fulfil its financial obligations to the UN. Similar problems have been
experienced in the funding of other international institutions such as the IMF
and World Bank. On present trends<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn15' href="#_edn15"

the European states will be funding half the costs of the UN by 2005, and will
be contributing twice as much as the US in cash terms. Many hope that the US
will re-engage in the wake of its campaign to build a global coalition against
terrorism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It is more than
just an argument about financial burden sharing which is casting a cloud over
the transatlantic relationship. There has been a rapidly growing perception in
Europe that the US is becoming less of a team player at the global level.
Although the need for the new 2001 Administration to define its strategic goals
has added to this perception, the signs pre-date the arrival of President Bush
into office. The US has always had some difficulty with deferring to the rule
of supranational authority. Given the separation of powers within the US
Constitution, it also has more<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The failure to
ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was particularly unwelcome. To this
was added the unwillingness to take part in the international ban on the use of
anti-personnel landmines. The apparent desire to abandon the ABM treaty and the
unwillingness to strengthen the Biological Weapon Convention (BWC) through more
robust verification protocols are added to the list of complaints about the US
approach to arms control. These difficulties existed before 2001, but there has
been a perceived move to a more unilateral approach under the new Bush
administration up until the terror attacks on US territory.<span

priority to the short term national advantage over the longer term global
interest. While the environment is not a direct NATO interest (although it can

been another important area for policy divergence. <span style='color:black'>On
17 July 1988, in Rome, 120 nations voted to establish an International Criminal
Court (ICC). It was a complex process. Some 1700 possible types of court were
considered. The UK (after its change of government), Canada and Germany led a
group of nations advocating a strong court, independent of the UN Security
Council, with universal jurisdiction. The US, France and China preferred the
Security Council to be in control (thus preventing any of the permanent members
from being embarrassed). In the end the Rome Statute was much weakened by trying
to accommodate the US position, and the ICC will require Security Council
authority for jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Although President Clinton signed the Treaty for the ICC in the last
hours of his Presidency, it was clear that he did so expecting his successor
and Congress to reject ratification. The Treaty needs 60 states to ratify it
before it comes into force. It is well on course with 37 having ratified so far
and 137 states having signed it. A weaker than necessary ICC will be formed
because of US reservations, and even then the US may refuse to be a part of the

this has been to galvanise the EU into greater action in the field of foreign
policy. It has campaigned actively around capitals to keep the Kyoto Protocol
alive. The success that it has had over Kyoto will have strengthened the
feeling that the EU can act on the worldís behalf without the support of the US
if necessary. The ICC will go ahead, with or without the US, and this will
reinforce a view that the US is isolated from the rest of the world. When the
new Bush Administration decided to withdraw from its predecessorís active
involvement in North Korea, a high level EU delegation was dispatched at very
short notice to take the place of US involvement. The EU has developed confidence
over the past years in its ability to negotiate as an equal with the US on
difficult trade matters. It appears that a parallel process is emerging in the

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In the area of
defence industries, the transatlantic security and trade issues collide.
Despite the worldwide decline in defence spending in recent years, the defence
industries still represent an import part of the manufacturing base for the US
and for many European countries. The armed forces provide a captive domestic
market; and exports through overseas arms sales are important to national
economies. The needs of NATO for interoperable technologies produced
efficiently are often at variance with the national priorities for defence
industries. Much rationalisation has gone in the defence industrial sector, but
there remains overcapacity and a national and regional tension on best
procurement practice for defence equipment. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There is a
particular transatlantic problem given the very large (and protected) US
domestic market for military equipment. Economies of scale and proportionately
much larger US government spending have generated an ever widening technology
gap with European military equipment. This is turn has given rise to new
approaches to warfare in<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>US
military thinking, which may not easily<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>be integrated into NATO doctrine. The Kosovo Air Campaign gave some
indication of how US technology now determines the style of campaign, and that
may exclude most European armed forces from the main action. The use of long
range air power with precision weapons as a precursor to any ground action has
become the norm for operations involving the US since the Gulf War.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The co-operative
arrangements which the defence companies make are driven more by their shareholders
than by the desires of NATO, the EU or of national governments. This means that
they have adapted themselves through mergers, acquisitions, partnerships and
project sharing arrangements to maximise their business share. It is likely
that this approach will be more successful in promoting reasonable
transatlantic co-operation than all the government driven initiatives. It would
be unfortunate if the defence industries were to develop into truly regionally
based opponents. While fear of US domination will remain a factor in the
approach which European governments take to military procurement, there still
remains sufficient flexibility for defence companies to co-operate in ways that
allows technology transfer and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

protectionism of defence industries can continue to generate difficulties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This paper
argues that we are entering a new period in the relationship between the US and
Europe, and that this will have significant effects on the security dimension.
Europe has depended on NATO for its security for over 50 years, and remains
attached to the concept of the Alliance. However, the widening gap in some
aspects of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>American and European
interests is making the need for an EU security dimension more apparent. There
is no indication that European states, whether members of NATO or not, desire
to bring about the end of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>this
very successful Alliance. Yet it is clear that the nature of NATO is changing
quite rapidly. Enlargement will make the decision-making process more complex.
The new members will bring little in terms of modern military capability, but
will have a great attachment to the promise of territorial defence. NATOís new
missions will be difficult to agree outside of the immediate problems
associated with the break up of what was Yugoslavia. NATO has made its first
Article 5 declaration in 2001, but it was more as a political than military
act.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In NATO, the US
has a very special status. As the major provider of military capability, it
expects to be able to mould the organisation in ways that are helpful to its
national aims. European member nations are expected to sign up to the threat
analysis, which is underpinning US defence and foreign policy. This was not a
major problem when the major threat was the Soviet Union, and the threat was
one which Europe faced as well. Today, the areas of security concern are
diverse, and the appropriate diplomatic and military responses are varied. The
US can no longer assume that its analysis will carry the argument with the
Europeans. However, the Europeans still need the US military capability
available in order to back up the political, economic and diplomatic levers of
conflict prevention. The only forum in which they can hope to tap into the
American military machine is NATO. It is therefore greatly in the European
interest to keep the Alliance alive and the US fully involved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The dilemma has
been sharpened by the recent moves towards the EU establishing its own military
capability. The Helsinki headline goal sets targets for what will be a very
small force in NATO terms. The Petersberg tasks, against which the EU
capability is sized, are distinct from NATOís main roles. The EU military
structures are very modest compared to the NATO bureaucracy. The force is
characterised as one that will contribute to a better NATO capability as well
as giving a European option when NATO does not wish to act. Yet none of the
reassurances is sufficient to stop the undercurrents of concern about the
possible long term effects on NATO. Some in the US fear that a more capable EU
will expect a stronger voice in NATO affairs at the expense of US influence.
Some in Europe fear that the EU will fail to generate any serious military capability,
while at the same time undermining NATO. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The elements of
the problem are clear. Europe and the USA want to retain a militarily capable
NATO as an insurance against future threats to their security, and as an agent for
promoting wider international peace. The EU, as a wealthy populous democratic
region, wants to be able to promote stability and prevent conflict around its
borders, and also protect its citizens and offer humanitarian relief where
needed. The US wants to remain involved in European security, but sees higher
threats to its national interests coming from other regions of the world. These
different requirements are not mutually exclusive, and it is possible to
outline a vision for the EU in which it can grow to be a more comprehensive
force for good. This means that it will need to develop the military aspects of
its capabilities as well as the economic and political.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>An EU with a
strong military capability could contribute to a more effective NATO. It could
relieve the US of some of the burden of providing military capability for its
region which is seen by the US as low risk.<span style="mso-spacerun:

reduction in commitment to NATO, but rather a rebalancing of the contributions
by member states. This future NATO might be seen in time as being formed of two
elements: the US and the EU. These equal partners would be able to shape the
developments and plan for the future of NATO more easily than the current
planning structure is able to. Such simplicity hides a number of important
problems. The EU members who are not members of NATO (the Cold War neutrals)
might find such an arrangement politically difficult today. The states which
are members of NATO but not of the EU (or in Denmarkís case have opted out of
the defence arrangements) would feel relegated to a minor role within NATO. In
the next 20 years these problems are likely to diminish. As both NATO and the
EU enlarge, the membership will become more congruent. As the Cold War becomes
ancient history and experience of EU CFSP extends, the sensitivity of the
neutrals, which is already low, will diminish further. They are in any case at
risk from international terrorism just as much as other members of the EU.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A NATO which was formed by an equal
partnership of the EU and the US could be more effective, and could overcome
many of the tensions that are emerging today. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>However, before
such an arrangement could come into being, the EU would have to be able to
provide a serious military contribution which was of the same order as the
American contribution to NATO. This is a much more demanding requirement than
the Helsinki headline goal of some 50-60,000 troops. It would mean that Europe
would have to offer the full range of high intensity modern capability as well
as the lower end peace support and other Petersberg tasks. If it were able to
field that type of capability, it would also be able to operate on its own
account in a wide variety of situations. In theory, there is no reason why the
EU nations could not put together such a capability. The US spends<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>around<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>$300 billion a year on its defence budget, and the 15 EU
nations currently spend a little over half of that amount. The US maintains a
global presence, and has three major overseas strategic arrangements (NATO,
Japan and Korea). This suggests that the EU defence spend would be enough for
Europeís more localised requirements. As NATO and the EU enlarge, this would
bring more defence budgets into the European side of the NATO equation.
However, the scale of spending is only one factor: more important is the
military capability that is generated by the spending.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Body><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>The inefficiencies of the
national approach to defence within European states are widely recognised. The
pooling approach to greater efficiency in defence spending on an EU wide basis
could and should be done on a progressive basis. This is not a new idea. NATO
fields a supranational early warning aircraft (AWACs) force because the
capability is too expensive for smaller nations to field. Some nations have
already come to bilateral arrangements for sharing specific resources in order
to cut costs. If we look at the European forces as a whole, we see duplication
of headquarters, planning, training, logistics support, procurement, research,
bases and other facilities. Opportunities for more effective operation of
European military forces are apparent across the range of military
capabilities. Only this approach can provide the necessary scale and capability
of military forces at a cost that the European governments are prepared to
play. Moves towards<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>integration
are therefore a necessary early step towards producing an EU military
capability which can be useful both within NATO and on its own.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Body><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If such a path
were followed by EU member states, it would be essential to set up some form of
EU defence budgetary arrangement at an early stage. The EU is well structured
to manage contributions from member states for a range of activities. A defence
budget would ensure that military capability contributions were made in a
structured manner and reflected the wealth of the contributing nation. The
political difficulties with such moves remain great. There is a reluctance
among many member nations currently to see the EU take on the form of a state.
An integrated military with a common EU budget is seen as one step too far.
However, the alternative is even more unappealing. As each country tries to
field a range of military capabilities, it finds itself unable to afford the
costs. Greater inefficiencies arise from attempts to balance costs, and the net
effect is to waste large amounts of defence spending for no national security
gain. This is becoming obvious throughout Europe, and should lead to a more
enthusiastic approach to the advantages of defence integration. Even so, it is
unlikely that significant EU capability will be fielded in under 10 years. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In the meantime,
the EU and the US will need to manage carefully their defence co-operation. A
clearly formulated and agreed long term plan by the EU would make this easier.
Currently, there are a wide variety of interpretations about where European
defence is going, what it is for, and how it will be used. What is lacking is
the necessary political leadership within Europe. A vision of an integrated
military capability as a force for good in the world could be attractive to
Europeans. If it was seen as a long term aspiration in the way that monetary
union was, then work could begin on developing the necessary plans and
structures. The time is shorter for such an approach than is generally
realised. If the EU muddles along as it has been doing, the tensions with NATO
will get worse. The US is likely to remain highly focused in the immediate
future on handling the new terrorist risk that it faces. The foreign policy
differences are real across the Atlantic, and Europe is relatively low on the
security concerns list<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>in the US.
If Europe wants a say within NATO, it must be prepared to provide a military
contribution which matches that of the US. If Europe wants to be able to act on
occasions outside of NATO, it needs a serious sustainable military capability.
Both of these needs require the same action: a move towards more efficient
defence spending through pooling, sharing and integration of military
capability.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There are many
more uncertainties after the terrorist attacks in Washington and New York on 11
September 2001. Defence budgets may rise in response to the new threat, or fall
in response to a deepening economic recession. The US may continue to build
international coalitions, or move back to a more unilateralist approach. The
coming year is a time of both opportunity and risk in EU/US relations. Too much
concentration on the suicide terror threat could risk undermining the good work
that NATO and the EU have been undertaking in building stability in the Balkans
