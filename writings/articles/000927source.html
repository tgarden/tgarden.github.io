<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	It is a mixed blessing to be slated to
speak at a Party conference on the same day as the Prime Minister.
While you may get a larger audience, there is little chance of
stealing the news headlines. Indeed the television and newspaper
coverage of Tony Blair's speech was only matched by a discussion of
how much he was sweating as he delivered it. Robin Cook, Geoff Hoon
and Clare Short  received virtually no coverage for their
contributions, despite some interesting trailers of the government's
priorities for foreign and security policy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Robin Cook delivered a confident and
amusing speech which was well received by delegates. He listed the
achievements of British foreign policy and ridiculed the Conservative
Party approach. While avoiding the word "ethical", he confirmed that
human rights were at the heart of his foreign policy. He even claimed
an endorsement from Lord Justice Scott for his changes to arms
exports procedures. It was in this area that he was most vulnerable
to criticism from Labour Party members, and speeches from the floor
politely asked for a further tightening of arms sales policy. He must
have felt that he got off comparatively lightly given widespread
criticism over the continuing sales of arms to repressive regimes,
and particularly the delivery of Hawk aircraft  to Indonesia. It
appears that he has little hope for an ethical foreign policy for
arms sales against MOD and DTI opposition. Looking to foreign policy
priorities for the next parliament, the Foreign Secretary list eight
areas: controlling small arms, stopping the spread of missile
technology, new European and US rules on arms sales, the
International Criminal Court, offering to host a UN staff college,
reform of the Security Council, a helpline for British travellers,
and a Special Envoy on the death penalty. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Geoff Hoon seem bored by both the occasion
and the message that he was delivering. He started by buying some
cheap applause with the story of the soldier killed during the rescue
mission in Sierra Leone. He announced one new initiative: a new joint
amphibious capability with European and NATO allies. This is
presumably an extension of the long standing UK/Netherlands
amphibious force. He dutifully (and with some justification)
criticised his Conservative predecessors for poor procurement and for
the cutbacks after the end of the Cold War, which had resulted in the
difficulties he now faced. He made the most of his triumph in
achieving a real (albeit very small)  rise in the defence budget in
the latest Comprehensive Spending Review. He saw the key priorities
as relieving overstretch, strengthening European defences, and "above
all ensuring our forces have the equipment they deserve" . As he then
went on to state  that all the warships would be built in British
shipyards, we can presume the European dimension and the value for
money aspects of procurement remain secondary considerations to
providing UK jobs. The intermittent polite applause around the hall
was more than he deserved for a lacklustre performance</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Clare Short gave a speech with more
substance and gravitas than either of her colleagues. She had the
confidence to intersperse the formal presentation with a number of
thoughtful off-the-cuff elaborations. She made a convincing case for
the need for stronger international institutions to combat world
poverty. This was important given the violent demonstrations against
globalisation that were happening  in Prague as she spoke. She also
explained clearly where the international community was on debt
relief, and how the next stage was made more difficult by the
conflicts in the indebted countries. Her achievement in the
inter-departmental budgetary battles was proportionally much greater
than either Robin Cook or Geoff Hoon. The 50% increase from &#163;2.2
billion to &#163;3.6 billion drew applause from delegates, although
John Spellar and Liz Symons of the MOD did not appear as enthusiastic
as others. She spent little time on anti-Conservative rhetoric as she
had much to say about DFID's  work around the world. She announced
new initiatives in Africa directed mainly towards improving primary
education in Rwanda and Malawi. She finished to prolonged and genuine
applause from the Conference. On this showing, she has grown yet more
in stature within the Party as well as proving herself to be  an able
Secretary of State.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	A common feature of all three speeches
(apart from knocking the Conservatives) was a focus on Sierra Leone.
After what each Minister said about the importance of Britain helping
in this war-torn country, we can expect more involvement over the
coming months. This will have adverse implications for the
overstretch within the British armed forces. </FONT></P>
