Defence?</FONT></CENTER></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	George Robertson may be feeling that he
got out of the Ministry of Defence in the nick of time. He has left
his successor, Geoff Hoon, to cope with a growing public litany of
problems in the military. Some of the stories in the media can be put
down to the usual tactical leaking ahead of the budget process, so
well satirised in "Yes Minister". The Defence Select Committee Report
of 2 February 2000 is a different matter.  The Chairman, Bruce
George, is a serious Labour backbench MP, who has sat on the Select
Committee continuously for the past 20 years. He  knows the lines
that the MOD has spun over the years, and is not going to let the
Department off the hook. Unusually, the Committee has a good record
at achieving cross-party consensus over the years, and has not been
afraid to tackle controversial topics. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The Committee comments on the lack of a
Defence White Paper since 1996, and makes it clear that it expects
the MOD promises of greater transparency to be delivered in practice.
The Performance Report (covered in The Source last month) is
described as "inadequate for its stated purpose". The Committee
invited the MOD "to indicate how it is moving in the direction of
greater clarity in its annual reporting cycle about the relationship
between resources, activities and outputs, and what further
developments it plans." As The Source indicated in December, the
Defence White Paper contained little hard information.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The whole tenor of the Committee's review
of progress since the Strategic Defence Review (SDR) is one of
concern. They highlight a number of areas where they feel things are
going off the rails. For example: "The SDR committed the UK to force
projection strategy. If we lack the ability to 'project' force, many
very expensive assets are wasted. We view the lack of adequate
deployability, particularly with regard to strategic airlift, with
grave concern and will follow developments closely."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The big issue remains that of overstretch,
and they spent some time taking evidence from Ministers, officials
and senior military officers on this problem. Their conclusion is
depressing: "Overstretch is the clearest and most urgent problem
facing our Armed Forces.The Army's establishment was to be increased
by 3,300 personnel which was why it was given longer than the other
two Services to achieve the full manning target. Around 2004 could
have meant late 2003, but in oral evidence, we were told that the
target date is now 31st March 2005. We conclude that slippage has
occurred and urge the MoD to concentrate on finding solutions rather
than on redefining targets."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The final conclusions of this report are
measured and make depressing reading. They include the following
statements:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000"> 		"The MoD have introduced
several measures to improve the lives of our Service men and women,
and more are to follow, but the critical problems of undermanning and
overstretch have not been solved. Indeed, the situation has almost
certainly deteriorated since the SDR. The next twelve months must
bring signs of improvement. </FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">		A budget that depends on
counter-productive sales, such as those linked to the privatisation
of DERA, has already served to undermine our confidence that that
promise of stability will be fulfilled. More fundamentally, the
quality of the MoD's reporting to Parliament has not yet reached the
stage where we can be confident that resources are being applied to
maximum effect, or be certain that less money does not mean less
peace and less security. </FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">		There is, it seems to us, a
fundamental implausibility in the total efficiency claimed by the MoD
over the years.</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">		Overall, we conclude that the
condition of the defence budget is sufficiently poor to give rise to
serious concern. The cumulative evidence of cancelled exercises,
delayed equipment programmes and of resources apparently insufficient
to reverse the problems of overstretch and undermanning suggest that
if the wheels have not yet come off the SDR, they are certainly
beginning to wobble alarmingly. The Department's finances should be 
rebalanced in the current Spending Review. Commitments and resources
have to be brought back into line, or we risk finding ourselves
stumbling from one crisis to the next."</FONT></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In this writer's view, the next crisis may
not be long in coming, particularly if the Northern Ireland peace
process is derailed.</FONT></P>
