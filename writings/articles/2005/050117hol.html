			<p>My Lords, I welcome greatly the opportunity this debate gives your Lordships to focus on the extraordinary dedication and professionalism showed by our armed forces. From these benches, we would wish to pay tribute to the work being done by the Services in response to the unprecedented destruction around the Indian Ocean following the Boxing Day tsunami, in addition to all the other commitments.</p>
			<p>With recent cuts in size to all three services, we&nbsp; on these benches have questioned whether the government has struck the right balance between the demands of operating at the high end of the warfighting spectrum, in concert with our American allies, and the equally demanding, ever present, stabilising tasks around the world. The search for ways to reduce manpower&nbsp; and operating costs to keep within budgets is not a problem unique to this government. We recognise that&nbsp; since 1997, Defence has for the first time in over a decade kept pace with domestic inflation. Yet this&nbsp; is insufficient to keep up with the rising cost of people and equipment, and to provide the funding for the transition to new technologies in warfare. As a result the government is taking a risk by cutting back some areas before the new more capable equipment is available. Whether it is early retirement of Sea Harriers, cut backs in infantry or early phasing out of the Jaguar force, this causes a dip in capability until either the new force is on line, or the commitment is eliminated.</p>
			<h3>Commitments&nbsp;</h3>
			<p>There seems little prospect of reducing commitments. In the Balkans, we have the transfer of the Bosnia task from NATO to the EU, and this will require UK involvement. Kosovo is looking more uncertain. In Afghanistan, despite the welcome success of elections, the security situation is not good. Our contribution to both the NATO ISAF force and the US led Operation Enduring Freedom looks as though it will be long term, and perhaps increase later this year. There is much talk of the two operations, ISAF and OEF, being merged and I hope that the Minister will give us an update on the plans.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>In Iraq, we are all to aware of the difficult challenges that our forces face. We support the deployment of the high readiness reserve force from Cyprus to reinforce UK forces in their area of responsibility ahead of the elections. It would have been more courteous of the Defence Secretary to announce this force enhancement as a Statement rather than slip it into Defence questions in the other place on 10 January 2005. Your Lordships would then have had an opportunity to consider the implications of this deployment. For the present, I would ask the Minister to tell us what further effects have there been on army units as a result of the deployment of&nbsp; st Battalion the Royal Highland Fusiliers, from Cyprus to the Multi-National Division (South-East) for a limited period in support of election security. Are they being replaced in Cyprus and if so by which unit? Have other units' readiness been increased?&nbsp;</p>
			<p>British forces are undertaking tasks around the globe to promote stability. In the Strategic Defence Review, the noble Lord, Lord Robertson of Port Ellen, made this Defence Diplomacy a prime task. As the Chancellor completes his tour of Africa, we may hope that more emphasis will be placed on the task of conflict prevention. Having worked in the recent past&nbsp; on providing advice to the FCO, DfID and the MOD on their joint approach to conflict prevention, I strongly support the use of pooled resources between the three departments for this important work. I trust the Minister will say a few words about the continuing support from the MOD.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>However all these tasks contribute to the demands for personnel numbers. Even the hoped for relief in Northern Ireland now appears less certain. Will the draw down in army manpower be slowed in response to the new difficulties in Northern Ireland?&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Before I turn from commitments to equipment, I will take the opportunity to raise yet again the question of the MOD's contribution to homeland security. As I have said on a number of occasions in this House, I am concerned that Defence Ministers seem so unwilling to look seriously as a dedicated high readiness consequence management capability for major unpredicted events. It is simply not good enough to say that we will respond with whatever is available on the day.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>&nbsp;Equipment</h3>
			<p>I turn now to equipment, both that in Service and that in the future programme. Having spent much time in the defence programmes area of the MOD, I do not see these as army, navy or air force issues. What we need is the optimum defence capability. I will start with the now little discussed nuclear deterrent. Could the Minister share with us the Government's thinking on the future for Trident? Is it true, as has been reported, that a decision on the successor system will be needed early in the next parliament, and if so why so early? Can he also assure the house that we shall shape policy decisions in the light of our Non Proliferation Treaty obligations? Could he also say what the UK position will be in any discussion of NATO's future nuclear policy?</p>
			<p>On battlefield systems, I recently congratulated the Minister on the speed of the introduction of the new Bowman communication system into service. I hope I was not premature, as the number of reports of difficulties with the equipment seem to be on the increase. A more heavily criticised procurement has been that of the Apache gunship helicopter, where, despite a timely delivery of the aircraft, the introduction into service has been very extended by inadequacies in the procurement of the support systems. Could the minister tell us where we are now with this important capability? The Future Rapid Effects System is also key to future plans. In giving evidence to the Defence Select Committee, the Chief of the General Staff cast some doubt on the date of introduction into service. Perhaps the Minister could give us his current thinking.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>While on the subject of helicopters, let me turn to support helicopters &#150; a key battlefield transport capability. Such helicopters are always in great demand for any operation. Whether it is in humanitarian rescue, post-conflict reconstruction, special forces insertion, defence diplomacy, or&nbsp; for high intensity conflict manoeuvre warfare or resupply, the support helicopter is the workhorse of modern forces. The Minister has already written to me to explain that we had insufficent available helicopters to help in Afghanistan when asked by NATO. Yet despite this insatiable demand, the MOD seems to be reducing the total available helicopter lift.&nbsp; Perhaps the Minister can reassure me that this is not the case. The extraordinary tale of the 6 Chinooks that were modified into losing their clearance to fly is an expensive disaster, but one that needs rectifying. Does the Minister intend to pay what it takes to get them airworthy, or is that helicopter capacity to be replaced by a new buy? And what of the projected drawdown of Pumas and Sea Kings? Does the overall helicopter lift remain steady, or is there a dip? These really are key capabilities and it is not clear whether they are being looked at in the round.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;Let me turn next to Sea Systems, where the focus is on the future promise of the two aircraft carriers. The into service dates of 2012 and 2015 appear ever more challenging. The procurement path has not been easy for the Minister, or for the Royal Navy. I note that the leader of the IPT has decided to jump ship, and that an interim IPT leader Mr John Coles, starts this very day, but that he will only hold the post for 9 months, while at the same time being triple-hatted as Chief Executive of Warship Support Agency and DG Nuclear for a time. This suggests that the concept of continuity in the procurement leadership of a major project has been abandoned.</p>
			<p>Yet I do not criticise the Minister for these events which are probably beyond his control. If we want to put together a complex project like this in UK shipyards, which have not built carriers for a very long time, the path will be rocky at times. Combining this with&nbsp; assumptions about the still emerging&nbsp; characteristics of the US F35 Joint Strike Fighter is bound to give rise to risk and uncertainty. The Defence Secretary at the Labour Party Conference, and some of the Minister's, friends in the other place have claimed that I therefore support procurement of US carriers. I do not. I have merely pointed out that if this were a very urgent defence requirement for big carriers, then the only answer would be to turn to the US. Just as for the urgent strategic lift requirement, the Government rightly went to the US for the C17 rather than wait for an option with greater UK industrial content. As it is, we can afford to develop to spend the time developing a UK solution, and we support the government's approach of reducing risk.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>My concern is that while we can take encouragement from the long term prospect of two carriers, we are currently facing an extended period with inadequate organic air defence cover for our existing carriers as the Sea Harrier goes out of service. We are also looking at a draw down of other surface ships with the frigate/destroyers numbers falling from 32 to 25. Promises for tomorrow do not cover commitments today.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The future of the F35/JSF/JCA project is also important in looking at the shape of our future offensive air power mix. We had a useful debate last Thursday on the Eurofighter/Typhoon project. It was however a salutary reminder of the long time that it takes to design, develop, procure and put into service a modern combat aircraft. The JSF seems to have considerable political support from the current US Defence Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, if rather less in some other parts of his department.&nbsp; It would be helpful if the Minister could give us an indication of how development is progressing from the point of view of project milestones, weight reduction and unit cost.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>While the recent press stories about budget trade offs between carriers and Eurofighters oversimplify, there is obviously a question to be considered. If JSF is delivered on time, and its roles overlap with Tranche 3 Eurofighter, do we intend to procure both? In the past, we had no problems with procuring a number of different aircraft to do the same task (Victors, Vulcans and Valiants for our nuclear bombers for example). With today's budgetary problems, and the difficulties in sustaining a sufficient number of fast jet pilots, the world is very different.</p>
			<p>In looking at our air capability, I am sure that the Minister will agree that air to air refueling is a key enabler and force multiplier. The procurement of the new capability has been prolonged. The Minister might wish to comment on&nbsp; the press reports yesterday of a settlement with EADS, and if not what timescales he is anticipating for the new capability. Could he also comment on whether the important tanker to tanker air refueling capability will be part of the capability.</p>
			<p>Before I conclude with some questions on personnel issues, I note that NATO Defence Ministers will be meeting in Nice in 3 weeks time. Could the Minister tell your Lordships what will be on the agenda, and what he sees can be done to reinvigorate the Alliance after such a difficult two years? How is the Iraq training mission going? European Security and Defence policy seems in much better shape at the moment, and I look forward to discussing that in the debate this Thursday.</p>
			<h3>&nbsp;Personnel</h3>
			<p>I turn now to our people. We repeatedly pay tribute to them, and echo the truism that they are our most valuable asset. It must be more than a clich&eacute;: we know that without people of the right quality, willing to serve, none of this vast investment in defence is worthwhile. It is not just that we owe our servicemen and women good conditions of service, but it is in the national interest to attract and retain good people in the armed forces both as regulars and reserves.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>At times of budgetary pressure, measures which affect personnel must sometimes&nbsp; be taken.&nbsp; The most obvious is the announced reduction in numbers in all three services. People will have their career expectations dashed, some will start preparing for civilian life earlier because they fear redundancy, and there could be a legacy of bad feeling about the loyalty of the services to their people. We know all this because, it has happened in&nbsp; previous downsizing exercises.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>There is also a tendency for relatively small scale savings to have a disproportionate effect in recruiting and retention. Looking at Cadets, I declare an interest as a past President of the Combined Cadet Force Association, and current President of the London &amp; South East Region Air Cadets. The Cadet organisations do extraordinary work in youth training and qualifications, while also informing about the Services. I pay tribute to the dedicated civilian and reserve staff who give so much of their time to these important organisations. I would ask the government to ensure that their funding is protected. The sums are small for the benefits which accrue. Apart from the cadets, we also have the three services represented at universities. These are ever more important ways of promoting an understanding of the work armed forces among the general population, and also acting as screening and recruiting tool into the military. There are rumours that the University Air Squadrons are under threat, and I would be grateful if the Minister could tell us the situation in his winding up.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>I know other noble Lords will address many other key personnel questions during this debate. The future size and role of the Reserves will I trust be one topic. But I would like to conclude with one issue which I believe must be addressed urgently. It has no resource implications, and cannot be ignored. The issue is that of making sure that all our servicemen and women, and deployed civilians,&nbsp; are able to cast their vote at the next general election, whenever it may occur. The question was raised in defence questions on 10 January in the other place, and the answer given by the Minister, Ivor Caplin, was less than satisfactory. If we send our troops out to promote democracy and secure elections in Bosnia, Afghanistan and Iraq, the least we can do is make sure they all have an opportunity to exercise their vote. Since 2000, the system has changed from a single registration to a requirement to register every year. This has led to steep decline in registered service voters. In most case it appears that only 10% of servicemen and women have reregistered. This is not satisfactory and the MOD needs to move quickly to ensure the services are not disenfranchised. I despair that, while the MOD website has a very good section on its art collection, it has nothing to say about voting.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>My lords, we are fortunate in the quality of our armed forces. Our job is to make sure that we do not allow that quality to evaporate through neglect. I look forward to hearing the contributions of so many noble lords on this important subject.</p>
