			<h4><b>Security or Liberty?</b></h4>

			<h3><b>Assessing Risk</b></h3>
			<p><b>&nbsp;</b>Security planning is all about assessing risk and then managing it. Planners are often accused of worst case analysis to justify excessive spending on capabilities and equipment; and this then leads to unnecessary public fears. There is some truth in the accusation. Yet if security planning is about being prepared for the unexpected, the planner must let imagination range far and wide. Threats that we foresee may be deterred by early action; it is the ones that we have not planned for which cause tragedies. While not always the case, forward planning and precautionary action can reduce the scale of risks.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The horrifying extent of death, injury and destruction from the tsunami in the Indian Ocean provides a topical illustration. Such a natural disaster in that region was seen as of low probability, but it is now clear that, once it happened, it had a high impact. Precautionary government action could not affect the timing of geological events, but could have reduced their impact. Contingency &nbsp;earthquake planning for the Pacific rim nations means that people can be warned in time to go to higher ground, and that deaths will be far fewer. So risk assessment for high impact but low probability events can save lives even in natural disasters.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>We managed the threat of nuclear war for more than 40 years. For most of that period, a nuclear exchange was unlikely given the effectiveness of mutual deterrence. Nevertheless, a nuclear war would have killed millions of people; and civil defence measures were taken by all governments to manage the potential consequences. Today, we face a complex mix of security risks, both natural and manmade, which are made greater by our dependence on the infrastructure of an advanced society. It was possible for terrorists to kill so many people in New York in 2001 because we build tall buildings, fill them with many people, and the skies are full of fuel-laden aircraft. Such a combination did not exist a century ago. We have also enjoyed increasing life expectancy, coupled with a western society which places great priority on personal security. This has implications for the perception of risks amongst the electorate, and may be leading to a trade off between individual freedom and collective security for society.</p>
			<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
			<h3><b>Threats of the 21st Century</b><b>&nbsp;</b></h3>
			<p>The question for policy-makers is which &nbsp;security threats, if any, are so challenging to society at large that they justify reducing the personal liberty of individuals. The threat of a nuclear war did not appear to generate much repressive governance in Western nations. The period of McCarthyism in the early 1950s in the United States was &nbsp;perhaps as extreme as reaction in democracies became, and did not persist. Today there is a long list of security challenges, but none carry the same risk of immediate global mass casualties.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>EU members have agreed a global security strategy which identifies five key threats as: terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, regional conflicts, failed states and organised crime. As the EU report says: &quot;Taking these different elements together - terrorism committed to maximum violence, the availability of weapons of mass destruction, organised crime, the weakening of the state system and the privatisation of force - we could be confronted with a very radical threat indeed.&quot; There is also an emerging consensus that environmental change through global warming represents a greater global risk in the long term than many of the more traditional security problems.</p>
			<p>The five key threats are inter-related. &nbsp;Failing states and regional conflict can make the conditions for the growth of crime and terrorism. Poor governance also encourages the proliferation of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. The possibility of suicidal extremist terrorism with access to WMD is a particular worry to governments. &nbsp;Yet any objective analysis of each of these problems&nbsp; shows them to be less dangerous than the possible failure of nuclear deterrence during the Cold War.&nbsp;</p>
			<h3><b>Terrorism</b></h3>
			<p><b>&nbsp;</b>European governments are only too well practised in dealing with terrorism. Over the last century many techniques have been tried. Terrorists with a political agenda welcome governments turning to repressive methods, as this swells their support among those who suffer the repression. Greater success in counter-terrorism has been achieved by isolating the terrorist from wider support, and this has meant adhering to the rule of law.</p>
			<p>It is argued by some that the growth of suicidal extremist terrorism has changed this balance away from the rights of the individual. There is little evidence to support this thesis. Repressive governments make mistakes which lead to injustices, and this recruits more terrorists to the cause. Intelligence gained under torture is unreliable and leads to a spreading pool of misinformation and further repression. Even when indefinite detention without trial is claimed as a way of removing potential terrorists from the streets, it would need to be proportionate to the threat. International terrorism has shaped Western policy since 9/11. Yet the number of people killed by it globally remain very small compared with other risks.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3><b>Proliferation</b></h3>
			<p><b>&nbsp;</b>Until the emergence in the 1990s of fanatical cult terrorism, proliferation worries centred on the development of weapons of mass destruction by states; and in particular by those undemocratic states thought to have aggressive intent to their neighbours or beyond. A combination of diplomatic pressure and sanctions has slowed the rate of such proliferation. Where it has occurred, in India and Pakistan, a more traditional form of mutual deterrence has come into play. Problems remain with Iran and North Korea, but none are solved by moving away from legal norms. In Iraq, where military intervention was used outside of the international legal framework, the risk of proliferation (if there had been WMD) was increased rather than diminished.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The risk of proliferation allowing terrorists to acquire weapons, which can kill many tens off thousands of people, is one which governments must take seriously. The&nbsp; most effective countermeasures are those which reduce the global availability of nuclear, biological and chemical warfare agents. While the use of such agents would undoubtedly increase the terror effect of any outrage, they remain difficult for terrorists to acquire and use effectively.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3><b>Responsibilities of Government</b></h3>
			<p>Governments have a prime responsibility to provide security for their citizens. However, they must also make difficult judgments across the spectrum of risks. Do they diminish economic growth by insuring against a small risk of a cataclysmic event?&nbsp; Do they constrain individual rights of all in order to find a handful of potential terrorists?&nbsp; Do they intervene in distant countries to pre-empt potential future challenges?&nbsp; It is often said that the surprise terror attack on the United States in 2001 has changed the calculus. The declaration of a &quot;war on terror&quot; by President Bush has seen many of the certainties of the rule of law under question.</p>
			<p>Three years on, we can assess that the new shortcuts to security have been largely ineffective. Afghanistan has become the major drug supplier to the West, and has increased the profits of organised crime. Iraq has become a source of weaponry for terrorists, and a centre of regional instability. Failure to apply a just settlement in Israel-Palestine has added more recruits to the extremists. Indefinite detention of suspects in Guantanamo Bay, Bagram, Abu Graib and Belmarsh has led in some cases to abuse and torture, and has acted as a recruiting drum for anti-Western radicals.</p>
			<p>Improving security is not helped by shortcuts in democratic processes. Indeed the evidence suggests that the reverse may be the case. The analysis may change if the scale of the risk or its probability increases. Once a disaster occurs, be it natural or manmade, lives may be saved by temporary suspension of individual rights. Emergency powers legislation recognises this; but it must be formulated to ensure as rapid a return to normality as the situation allows. There are no quick fixes.</p>
