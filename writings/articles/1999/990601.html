<P><CENTER>Sir Timothy Garden - 10 June 1999</CENTER></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	The world's TV cameras were trained on the vast camouflage tent
at Kumanovo for hour after hour. Commentators filled the hours with
speculation on progress for the military technical agreement between
NATO's General Mike Jackson and Serbia's General Svetozar Marjanovic.
The surprise settlement after a hurried reconvening during the
evening of 9 June has left the world celebrating the end of the war.
Yet the real problems are now only just beginning. The weeks of the
air campaign were relatively easy to manage compared to the task that
awaits the international community, including NATO, over the next 4
months. Winter is the unnegotiable deadline for providing adequate
shelter for a million or more refugees. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Today, the focus is on verification of Serbian withdrawal from
Kosovo and ensuring that the UN Security Council resolution is
appropriately phrased.  The tidy division of the province into five
sectors still has to accommodate Russian sensitivities. The waiting
KFOR forces are eager to secure their entry into Kosovo and worried
that any delay will lead to further chaos. Departing Serbs and KLA
Albanians both have reasons for causing havoc unless controlled. Once
the international force has begun to take over control, there is an
almost endless list of problems to be tackled. The military tasks
will include identifying and marking minefields (it will take many
months for extensive clearance to be completed). Bridges and tunnels
may have been prepared for demolition, and buildings may be
booby-trapped. The combination of ethnic cleansing, war with the KLA
and NATO bombing has left little in the way of housing or utilities.
Roads will need to be cleared, accommodation provided and water and
power restored. At the same time the military will need to defend
themselves, protect the Serb civilian minority, control the KLA, and
establish the order necessary for the rebuilding of civil society.
The refugees displaced internally in Kosovo will be in great distress
and need medical assistance, but will also be pushing to return to
their destroyed villages. The refugees in camps in all the
surrounding countries will be difficult to bring back in an orderly
fashion.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	On the humanitarian side, the UNHCR and the the many aid NGOs
will have to integrate with the military operation and move very
quickly to provide appropriate winter accommodation for returning
refugees and also establish food and water supplies. In parallel the
re-estabishment of  the civil society will be a priority for the
United Nations civil authority. Enormous financial resources will be
needed. Past experience suggests that nations are faster in providing
for the cost of bombs than the cost of water pipes. There will be two
security issues which will need urgent action. The world will expect
a rapid investigation of the atrocities that have been reported, and
this may prove difficult in the midst of all the other action that is
urgently needed. At the same time, the demilitarisation of the KLA
will probably be as difficult as the decommissioning of arms in
Northern Ireland.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	In the longer term, the international community still has to
solve the problem of stability in the Balkans. If Montenegro is not
to become the next Kosovo, some coherent approach to stabilising the
region is needed. This is made more difficult by the indictment of
President Milosevic as a war criminal. It will be difficult to
address the future of the region as long as one of the key figures is
a pariah. It may be that he will be displaced, but that is by no
means certain.  Without a comprehensive Balkan strategy for the long
term, we can expect to have UK forces in the area for many years.
Ultimately, we need to bring the region into Europe in the same way
that we have engaged the states of Central and Eastern Europe.</P>
