			<p>Tony Blair's resignation today will be picked over by the commentators for&nbsp; years to come. As he said, the intelligence about Saddam's WMD was pretty accurate. We learned that in the first hours of the war, when so many British soldiers died in a barrage of chemical artillery. The Butler inquiry examined in great detail why &quot;the required levels of detection and protection were not always available to everyone&quot;. As the Defence Select Committee had found, lack of protective suits and vehicle filters were to blame. Blair was fortunate to survive this damning report, but it was at the cost of his Defence Secretary, Geoff Hoon.</p>
			<p>The siege of Baghdad from May to July 2003 deepened the split between the Anglo Saxon alliance and the rest of the world. Coalition soldiers made slow progress in their protective gear against the continuing&nbsp; barrage of chemical artillery. Air power brought a sort of end to major combat at the price of horrifying civilian casualties. These were compounded by widespread outbreaks of anthrax and other diseases throughout the whole of Iraq. Riots followed as people tried to get medical help. It was presumably during this time that Saddam loyalists stole the nerve agents and toxins, which caused last week's disaster.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>With the resounding defeat of Bush in November, Blair lost his last ally. The US electorate was sickened by the pictures of the survivors of Tikrit after the strike by an Israeli tactical nuclear missile following the chemical weapon attack on Tel Aviv.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The continuing use of chemical and biological agents in attacks by insurgents has made normalization very difficult. Kerry and Blair have announced that they expect to be able to provide protective vaccination for all Iraqi political candidates in time for the 2007 election timetable.</p>
			<p>It is not yet clear which extremist organisation was responsible for the synchronised attacks across the UK&nbsp; on Friday. Porton Down has confirmed that the plague strain is identical to that uncovered by the Iraq Survey Group last year. However, as the Prime Minister said, it was almost certainly lost in the chaos of the intervention and the subsequent riots. He wished his successor well in leading the coalition government at this time of national emergency.</p>
