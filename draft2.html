<P ALIGN=CENTER>MARITIME WARFARE</P>

<P>War at sea has a long and well documented history. Given that
three-quarters of the Earth's surface is ocean, that until recently
international trade has depended almost exclusively on sea transport,
and that nation states have grown up around points of access to the
oceans, it is scarcely surprising that control of the sea routes has
assumed such strategic significance. This century has seen naval
conflict extend from the two dimensional operations of surface fleets
into a theatre which encompasses the space and air above the oceans,
as well as the deeps beneath the surface of the sea. Technical
developments have radically changed the character and method of naval
warfare. To judge the elements of naval power most relevant to the
future, it is worth examining those innovations which have so
dramatically changed the war at sea over the past two centuries.</P>

<P>Since the time of the Phoenicians, naval warfare had consisted of
combat between warships intent on the sinking or capture of their
adversaries. In the nineteenth century the nature of the warship was
revolutionised by the development of steam power. Sea power could be
applied rapidly where and when it was required. It was no longer
dependent on the vagaries of the wind, or, in more ancient times, the
strength of the oarsmen. The transition from sail to steam for
fighting ships was not instantly recognised as a significant advance
in the art of maritime warfare. Dating the invention of the steam
powered ship from William Symington's steamboat, the Charlotte
Dundas, in 1802, it would be another 55 years before the British Navy
finally abandoned its last sail warship. Innovation was not to be
rushed in those days. It is interesting to compare it with military
adoption of aircraft a century later, following the first heavier
than air flying machine in 1903. If progress had been as slow, then
balloons would be in use for offensive operations concurrently with
supersonic fighter-bombers. The vulnerabilities of the paddle steamer
to gunfire with its engine above the water line continued until the
introduction of the screw propellor. Despite the idea dating from
Archimedes, it was 1839 before the first major screw-driven warship
was built (named after the venerable Greek himself). The move to
steam power was not without penalties. While the wind might not be
reliable, it was at least universally available, and provided free of
charge. Steam power needed fuel to generate it. Ships were tied to
supply lines and coaling stations, and combat radius became limited
by refuelling requirements. Technology could provide ships with power
on demand at the price of range limitation. The price had to be paid.
The advantage gained by being able to ignore the winds far outweighed
the logistic penalty. Steam power had an absolute advantage over
sail, and that meant that sail warships would always be beaten in a
battle against a powered warship.</P>

<P>In any form of fight the outcome depends on a combination of how
well the fighter can defend himself against the blows of his enemy,
as well as on how hard he can deliver blows. Speed and
manoeuvrability were crtical in both regards for warships. When under
attack, powered ships could cut and run. When attacking, they could
position themselves rapidly to gain the most advantageous position.
Technology was also offering improvements to the defence in the form
of protective materials for building ships. Iron offered much better
resilience to attack than wood. As the armour plating became more
efficient, naval guns were developed to have more penetrating power.
In the second half of the last century there was a continual race
between firepower and armour for ships. In two decades the thickness
of the iron protection increased from 4.5 inches to 24 inches (1),
and new manufacturing processes made the armour even stronger. The
technical developments were driving the increasingly rapid
replacement rate for warships, each needing better armour and better
guns than its predecessor. Sea power more than ever before became a
reflection of a nation's industrial capability.</P>

<P>The critical change in the nature of sea power from sail to steam
had taken the first half of the century to incorporate into the
world's navies; the incremental changes to armour and firepower were
introduced with increasing rapidity. Two new devices for sinking
ships affected the conduct of operations in the second half of the
nineteenth century: the mine and the torpedo. Mines could be used to
defend home ports, to deny access, and to provide offensive firepower
across expected enemy shipping routes. Primitive torpedoes saw
service in the American Civil War, and were developed over the years
that followed to have compressed air motors, depth control and
gyroscopic steering. The significance of the torpedo was in its
ability to provide a threat to capital ships from small launch
platforms. The torpedo boat was a relatively inexpensive way to
provide potentially devastating firepower. But such boats were
themselves vulnerable to specially designed destroyers, which were
built to protect the warships. The torpedo boat in turn could best be
protected by hiding it under the sea, and the submarine provided the
answer. From a practical demonstration by Bourgeous and Brun in 1863,
France, Britain and the USA were all fielding torpedo equipped
submarines by the turn of the century.</P>

<P>By the start of the twentieth century, naval warfare had been
transformed from the meeting of ships at close quarters for a cannon
fight, a battering engagement or a boarding. The advent of more
powerful and accurate guns, torpedoes from boats and submarines, and
mines had made naval engagements far more complex. The warship was
becoming more heavily armoured and carrying more firepower, which
made it both more expensive and more attractive as a target. It
needed to be protected by destroyers and mine clearance systems.
While the nature of maritime warfare was changing because of
technological innovation, scientific advances were being made in many
fields which could have military applications: the internal
combustion engine, wireless telegraphy, and electricity in
particular.</P>

<P>How did the world's naval powers respond to the opportunities for
technological advantage? The British set the pace for bigger and
bigger warships with the Dreadnought and subsequent giants. Smaller
numbers of larger ships were forecast to be more cost effective (2).
Thickness of armour and size and number of guns (with rotating
turrets and centralised fire control) were maximised to produce very
expensive capital ships. Designers looking for cheaper ways to combat
these warships traded armour for speed and manouevrability in the
cruisers. The French produced more submarines than the other powers,
but depended on petrol-engine propulsion.</P>

<P>In the event, World War 1 had a number of surprises for maritime
operations. The super battleships met rarely in combat, and spent
much of the war ensuring that they were in safe havens. In the major
engagement at Jutland, the heavy armour proved its worth in such set
piece battles, and the cruisers suffered severely. This victory for
the British fleet gave no critical strategic advantage, as control of
the surface of the sea was no longer the only consideration. The day
of the submarine had arrived. At the beginning of the war Germany had
only 10 diesel powered U- boats and another 18 petrol engined (3).
Yet in the opening days it was able to force the Royal Navy to move
from Scapa Flow because of the threat. More importantly, the success
of the submarine against merchant shipping could have been a
war-winning capability. The U-boats were so successful that had it
not been for inhibitions on production and operations after American
protests to the Kaiser, they might have deprived Britain of the
resources with which to continue the war. The crucial importance of
containing the submarine threat led to much effort being devoted to
anti- submarine warfare technology. The hydrophone, depth charge,
anti-submarine destroyer, aircraft spotting, and mines all
contributed to the solution. With the benefit of hindsight, the
historian can point to a more effective possible scheme for defence
equipment development in the early 1900s. The power of the submarine
was not foreseen, or to some extent even realised very rapidly once
the war had started. The naval arms race for more surface warships
made ever more valuable targets which needed more and more
protection; while at the same time the ships built were not to be of
critical import to the outcome of the war that was to take place.
Devoting the resources to submarines and torpedoes could have
crucially affected the outcome. Developing anti-submarine warfare
techniques before the war in anticipation of the threat could have
paid great dividends. It is debateable whether there was sufficient
time for aircraft to be developed for more effective maritime use
given the limitations in range, communications, navigation equipment
and weapons at that time.</P>

<P>The inter-war period was a pause, although the lessons learned in
the recent major conflict could have been exploited in a time of
rapid scientific advance. In general there was remarkably little
progress other than incremental improvements to weapon systems. It
was a difficult time for resources for military equipment. Germany
was constrained by the terms of the Versailles peace treaty, Russia
was reeling under the post-Revolution chaos, and the US and Europe
were increasingly disarmament minded. Artificial constraints on naval
ship tonnage negotiated at the Washington Naval Conference of 1921
ensured that money for naval modernisation remained scarce.</P>

<P>The new key element in any future naval conflict would be air
power. In the United States, General Billy Mitchell tried to convince
the many doubters of the future importance of aircraft in maritime
battles, and was eventually court-martialled for his pains. His
flamboyant demonstrations of attacks on surface vessels showed just
how vulnerable ships had become to aerial bombardment. While fellow
airmen shared his views on the potential, his naval colleagues were
not convinced(4). It would be 1940 before the power of naval air
power was fully realised with the sinking of the Konigsberg. The
following year saw land based aair power sinking the Prince of Wales
and the Repulse. It was left to the Japanese to develop the aircraft
carrier as a powerful offensive weapon platform, which they used
successfully against the Chinese before World War 2. Other nations
put aircraft on to ships more for defensive purposes, or with the
intention of ferrying them between theatres of operations. The
carrier grew in significance rapidly from 1941. At Pearl Harbour, the
Japanese destroyed 311 US aircraft, sank two battleships, and caused
major damage to a further three for the loss of a total of 29 of
their own aircraft. The lesson was well taken, and the US moved
rapidly towards a carrier based strategy. By the middle of 1942, the
US carrier forces were able to defeat the numerically larger Japanese
forces at Midway. The crucial factor was the attaining of air
superiority, and part of this came through the benefits of new
reconnaissance capabilities which technology was providing (5).</P>

<P>For hundreds of years naval engagements had depended on visual
sighting of enemy vessels. In modern times, reconnaissance by boats,
balloons or aircraft, and the gathering of intelligence information
could help to find the enemy; but for a successful attack, visual
target acquisition remained necessary. While warships were large
vessels and could be seen at line of sight ranges in good weather,
they disappeared in poor visibility, in fog and at night. Submarines
had to be spotted while they were on the surface, which would
normally be under cover of darkness. An alternative, though somewhat
alarming, method of submarine spotting was to back project the
tell-tale line of bubbles from a launched torpedo. For observing the
surface of the oceans, the development of radar from 1938 onwards
dramatically changed the picture. Radar could make ships or
submarines on the surface visible out to the line of sight horizon by
day or night, and virtually regardless of the weather. Mounting radar
in aircraft from 1941 onwards extended the radar horizon, so that
ships and submarines could no longer depend on the cover of darkness
to move or to surface. Ships' radars reduced the risk of surprise by
the enemy from the air or from the sea. The technological advantage
that the US had in having warning of the enemy through radar was a
significant contribution to success at Midway. In many respects the
maritime environment is ideal for radar use. Ships have high radar
contrast against the uniform background of the sea. They also move
relatively slowly and considerable information can be built up from
comparatively few airborne radar sensors.</P>

<P>Radar could only help in the anti-submarine battle when the
submarine was on the surface. The sea is opaque to electromagnetic
radiation at radar frequencies. For detection beneath the sea, the
passive hydrophone, which listened for the noise of passing
submarines, was supplemented by a system analagous to radar: ASDIC
(6). The use of reflected sound pulses to detect underwater targets
had been under development since the end of World War 1. Indeed the
progress made gave the British undue confidence in their ability to
detect and destroy enemy submarines in any future conflict. Compared
with radar in air, acoustic energy in water travels less predictable
distances, suffers propagation anomalies and is not very
discriminating. Nevertheless, the development of techniques for
locating submerged submarines was a vital step forward in maritime
warfare.</P>

<P>Both radar and ASDIC brought with them new vulnerabilities.
Emitting a pulse of sound or radar energy gives information to the
enemy. The outgoing pulse is necessarily much more intense than any
reflected echo. The target will thus know that it is being subject to
attention at greater ranges than the sensor operator can detect the
return pulses. Using passive detection systems, the hunted can become
the hunter, and the surveillance system can become a homing beacon
for the attacker. As we shall see later, new capabilities are often
limited by the vulnerabilities that they carry with them.</P>

<P>The experiences of World War 2 signalled the end of the battleship
as the centrepiece of sea power. It would continue to have a role in
coastal bombardment and in projecting naval presence, but the
flexibility and offensive range of air delivered systems meant that
its traditional role would be taken over by the aircraft carrier. The
technical developments which were coming to fruition at the end of
the war were to have profound effects on maritime operations. Atomic
research had produced both nuclear weapons and nuclear power sources.
Air-breathing missiles and ballistic rockets had been used as weapon
delivery systems. The jet aircraft had entered service. In World War
2 these innovations had been directed towards land and air
operations; after the war, they were absorbed into naval operations
with dramatic effect.</P>

<P>For propulsion, steam power changed the nature of naval warfare in
the last century. It carried with it a penalty in the form of the
need for logistic support. Nuclear power offers the prospect of
virtually limitless range and motive power, without the need for
continual resupply of fuel. It could make navies independent of
either overseas bases or their armadas of support vessels. In the
days before global satellite reconnaissance, a nuclear power plant
could allow ships the freedom to roam over the oceans and keep their
location and intentions secret. As with so many technical advances,
nuclear power also brought some penalties. The reactor, associated
power conversion system and shielding are bulky, heavy and expensive.
Indeed the cost/size penalty is so great that it has only proved
practical to use nuclear power plants for the largest of the surface
ships. Even for these modern Dreadnoughts, it can be argued that the
advantages are not great. In modern naval warfare, surface ships do
not operate independently. They have a flotilla of defensive ships,
all of which in turn require support, and the freedom of action is
therefore already constrained. In 1996, there were only 16 nuclear
powered warships in the world (7 US aircraft carriers, 5 US and 4
Russian guided missile cruisers).(7). Technology was able to provide
the answer to the sailor's dream of limitless power to give speed and
range, and yet be independent of base support; but at a price which
made it impractical.</P>

<P>Part of the lack of attraction for nuclear propulsion was as a
result of the development of an efficient alternative. The jet engine
had been developed in the context of a better power plant for
aircraft to enable them to operate at higher speeds. The high power
and good power to weight ratios of the engine made them attractive to
naval engineers. Easier to maintain and requiring less manpower, they
have subsequently become the general replacement for the petrol,
diesel and coal plants of the past.</P>

<P>There was one aspect of sea power in which the advantages of
nuclear power plants outweighed the cost and weight penalties.
Submarines, when submerged, must operate with a power source which
does not need oxygen in order to burn its fuel. It is easy to forget
that the air is an essential part of the fuel of all the vehicles,
boats and aircraft that operate around us. Oil-based fuels need
oxygen to burn and produce power in an engine. Air is a commodity in
short supply in a submerged submarine. Electric motors provided a
ready answer to the problem, but had limitations. They needed
batteries as their energy source, and the batteries needed regular
recharging. To do this the submarine would have to come to near the
surface, and run its diesel engine as a battery charger. Taking in
air and exhausting burnt fuel, the submarine was vulnerable to
detection and to attack, while at the same time not having the
variety of defensive armament available to other surface vessels.
Nuclear power can provide virtually unlimited motive power without
the need to surface, and can also recirculate the air for the crew to
breathe, and purify the sea water for drinking. The power allows the
submarine to operate at high speed if necessary, and stay submerged
as long as the crew's rations last. By transforming the survivability
of the submarine, the nuclear power plant becomes a technological
innovation worth paying for. There are currently 251 nuclear powered
submarines operating around the world in five navies (8).</P>

<P>In the author's view, for the Cold War, the nuclear powered
submarine assumed the mantle of the flagship of sea power: a title
held only briefly by the aircraft carrier after it took it from the
battleship. The nuclear power plant has caused the submarine to grow
in size - the Soviet Typhoon class displaces 25,000 tons (9) - and in
firepower. It is undetectable except when coming in for an attack,
and has freedom to roam the oceans worldwide. There are those who
would argue that it cannot replace the capital ship, on the grounds
that its invisibility means that it cannot project power. This view
carries less weight in the light of the experiences of the Falklands
Conflict of 1982. The possibility of a nuclear powered submarine
being in the area of the Falklands ahead of the Task Force, allowed
the British Government to declare an exclusion zone at an early
stage. The sinking of the Argentinian warship, General Belgrano, by a
nuclear powered submarine caused the Argentinian Navy to seek safe
refuge in mainland ports, and hence gave the British control of the
sea. Notwithstanding this control, the Royal Navy had to expend
considerable effort on guarding against the possibility of a
submarine attack by one of Argentina's 3 submarines. The evidence of
the critical importance of the submarine in two world wars has been
confirmed in the 1980s by the Falklands Conflict. Submarines were
already powerful, but the advent of nuclear power has given them
flexibility and invulnerability. However as yet the submarine lacks
the ability to control the airspace above the ocean. The nuclear
powerplant all brings with it significant extra long term costs. It
is likely that the number will continue to decline in the absence of
superpower confrontation.</P>

<P>While technology had provided the power source which could allow
submarines to operate with true freedom, the weapon systems of both
surface and sub-surface vessels have also been completely transformed
in the post-war era. Ship main armament had not increased in calibre,
range or firepower significantly since the days of the Dreadnoughts.
Improvements had come from measures to improve accuracy and control.
The development of missile technolgy offered major increases in range
of offensive weaponry with further improvements in accuracy, and the
capability of increased destructive power. Each missile costs far
more than each shell for a naval gun, but a ship armed only with guns
must always be at risk to an adversary able to fire missiles at
distances beyond gun range. The advent of the missile has therefore
relegated the gun to the role of shore bombardment, close attack
against a poorly defended enemy vessel, and terminal air defence
using modern rapid fire systems.</P>

<P>For attacking other ships, cruise missiles have taken over the
role of the guns. The biggest guns (the US 16" calibre) have a
maximum range of 40 km over which distance they have an accuracy of
around 550 metres , and can fire only two rounds per minute (10). A
Tomahawk cruise missile can carry 1000lbs of high explosive a
distance of 460 km and with its terminal radar guidance will hit the
target. The land attack version operates out to 1300km with an
accuracy of better than 10 metres (11). The range, explosive power
and accuracy of these modern missile systems has changed the nature
of naval warfare yet again. Given intelligence through airborne or
satellite reconnaissance, or from other sources, a ship can be
attacked from over the horizon. As always this progress carries with
it a penalty. Each Tomahawk missile cost $M1.27 in 1982. The shorter
ranged (110km/500lbs HE) Harpoon missile was estimated to cost
$940,000 per round (12). Against these enormous costs must be set the
effectiveness of the weapons. In 1968, the Israeli destroyer was sunk
by Egyptian Styx missiles fired from coastal patrol boats. In 1982,
the Royal Navy destroyer HMS Sheffield was destroyed by an
air-launched version of the Exocet cruise missile. An Exocet costs
about $250,000 (13), which is about one thousandth the cost of a
modern destroyer.</P>

<P>The Gulf War of 1991 brought the power of cruise missiles on to
the television screens of the general public. The precision
navigation, using terrain matching techniques, could be shown by
reporters watching missiles pass by their hotel rooms finding their
way to specific buildings in Baghdad. Some 288 cruise missiles (14)
were launched from surface ships and submarines.</P>

<P>The power of the missile makes it a key factor in modern naval
warfare. While it is expensive, its targets are orders of magnitude
more costly. The threat to surface ships can come from missiles
launched from other ships, from aircraft, from land-based systems or
from submarine launched missiles. Each new threat spawns research
into countermeasures. Here again the missile has assumed a major
role. To defend itself a ship can attempt to destroy the missile
launch platform. Surface to air missiles engage attacking aircraft,
surface to surface missiles attempt to beat potential attackers to
the draw, anti-submarine rocket delivered depth charges and torpedoes
defend against submarines. To prevent incoming missiles reaching
their targets various defensive measures are taken. Some missiles use
radar-homing, and the target ship can use electronic counter-measures
to deceive the missile sensors. When infra-red homing is used decoy
hot sources may be used to deflect the incoming weapon. Cruise
missiles travel at similar speeds to aircraft, and missile and gun
defences can also be used against them.</P>

<P>Nuclear powered submarines, missiles, radar, air power and
maritime surveillance systems have all changed the face of naval
warfare. Yet there was one development which complicated predictions
of future maritime operations more than all the rest put together. In
the immediate post war period, atomic weapons were so expensive, so
difficult to construct, so large, and so critical to strategic plans
that they seemed to have limited relevance to future sea battles.
With the development of tactical nuclear weapons of small physical
size and limited explosive yield, it became possible to give
virtually every naval weapon a nuclear capability. A depth charge
which uses a nuclear explosion offered a much greater prospect of
destroying or disabling a submarine once its position has been
roughly located. A nuclear warhead can be fitted to a torpedo. A
nuclear missile launched from an aircraft, a land base, a surface
ship or a submarine can destroy any ship once it has been located,
identified and is within range. That range will be several hundred
miles. Nuclear weapons thus gave naval firepower a very high
probability of success in destroying their targets while at the same
time giving naval weapon platforms much greater vulnerability when
faced with a nuclear armed enemy.</P>

<P>Opinions vary as to the utility of such naval nuclear warfighting
systems. The special constraints afforded to nuclear weapons, in the
light of the dangers of escalation to strategic nuclear exchange,
could operate in two differing ways. It could be argued that a
maritime engagement allowed the use of nuclear weapons with no risk
of collateral damage, and with relatively easy escalation control. In
some future conflict, the political judgement could be that resolve
could be signalled by the use of a nuclear torpedo. Even at the
height of the Cold War there was a view that the release of nuclear
weapons would be such a critical decision, and such a change in the
nature of the conflict, that it would be unlikely to be made for a
naval engagement, the outcome of which would not directly affect the
overall advance of the enemy. The tactical maritime nuclear weapons
were early casualties of the reductions in nuclear arsenals in the
closing days of the Cold War. Given the willingness of nations to
abandon these capabilities, it is clear that they were seen by
politicians as having somewhat limited utility.</P>

<P>The most dramatic effect of nuclear weapons on naval operations
has been the emergence of a new role of overwhelming importance. The
bringing together of the nuclear powered submarine and the long range
nuclear warhead missile has brought a new element to warfare. Nuclear
weapons have not been used in anger since World War 2. The fear of
nuclear retaliation has deterred nations from employing these
weapons. A key element in this strategy of nuclear deterrence is the
requirement for a military capability to inflict an unacceptable
level of damage in retaliation on an enemy, regardless of any pre-
emptive action the enemy might take. Nuclear powered submarines can
remain hidden under the sea for months. Armed with ballistic missiles
carrying multiple nuclear warheads, they can threaten retribution
from anywhere in vast areas of the oceans. Undetectable and hence
invulnerable they are the most credible part of a nuclear nation's
nuclear forces. In addition, as the accuracy of such weapon systems
increase, there is considerable advantage in replacing land-based
nuclear systems with appropriately equipped submarines. Even in the
post-Cold War era, the nuclear powers have kept their submarine-based
nuclear missiles, and have invested in modernisation.</P>

<P>This rapid review of the major technical developments which have
changed the nature of maritime warfare over the past two centuries
has taken as given the need for sea power. Before the nuclear age,
the importance of control of the sea was easily understood. Sea-going
nations had provided navies for a number of purposes: to protect
their trade routes; to secure overseas possessions; to deter other
nations from war; and to secure their sea lines of communication in
war. In the early years of the nuclear age, when nuclear bombs were
scarce and air-delivered, the major naval powers could expect to have
roles little changed from the last war in the next. Once nuclear
weapons became plentiful, delivery systems accurate and varied,
surveillance systems global, thermo-nuclear war scenarios notable for
their brevity, the roles of navies became more difficult to predict.
</P>

<P>If nuclear weapons were used extensively in a future war, and
ports and harbours were included as targets, it could be argued that
the protection of merchant shipping becomes an irrelevance. Sea power
is exercised in slow time, and strategists suggested that a nuclear
war, once started, looked like being over on the land before the
further supplies, troops and equipment brought by sea could have an
influence on the outcome. However, the very power of nuclear weapons
has made their use in war less likely. The increasing use of
<I><FONT COLOR="#000000">coalitions of the williing  </FONT></I>to
enforce international order has been the pattern of the 1990s. The
Gulf War had both the restoration of the sovreignty of Kuwait and the
protection of strategic energy resources as motives for
participation. Operations at a distance require support by sea. The
power of modern missile systems can mean that a militarily inferior
state can threaten a major naval power. Protecting sea routes becomes
more difficult both because of the diversity of threats and also the
nature of the modern international system. Before the Gulf War,
Western nations were concerned about the security of their oil supply
route, and undertook international mine clearing operations in the
Gulf. When merchant shipping is put at risk by third parties engaged
in war, naval power is needed to protect them. During the Iran/Iraq
war in 1988, this protection extended to the use of offensive naval
operations to protect the passage of tankers. The Falklands Conflict
of 1982 gave an example of the modern use of sea power to secure a
nation's overseas possessions. Preparations for the Gulf War of 1992
required massive sea lift to position all the equipment and stores
for the Allies. Sea power was used extensively by NATO and WEU for
embargo operations as the Former Republic of Yugoslavia broke up.
</P>

<P>Nations which have such commitments will need the balanced
military forces necessary for such operations. However, as effective
counter-measures become available to third world nations through new
weapon systems, the retention of a large scale capability to
intervene by sea will become increasingly expensive. The step change
brought to Navies by technology seems at present to be in a state of
suspension. The most powerful nuclear weapons systems are less
useful, and the need for aircraft carriers and minesweepers is more
the order of the day. In line with the supposed need for more readily
deployable forces, amphibious units are in favour in many countries.
</P>

<P>Looking for the lessons to be learned from the major technical
changes to maritime capability, it is possible to draw out certain
common factors. These are combat performance areas where a
qualitative change results in a significant enhancement (or
limitation) in naval power. The recurring areas, which are not
mutually exclusive are: speed and manoeuvrability; firepower and
accuracy; radius of action; detection and detectability;
vulnerability and survivability; support requirements; and finally
cost effectiveness. In examining the application of current technical
advances to future maritime operations, it will be worth looking at
the probable implications for these areas first. It may be that other
factors, such as arms control, political constraints, manpower,
training, communications, or fuel availability, become additional
considerations. We examine these questions in the last part of this
book.</P>

<P>The last point that can be extracted from the history of naval
technology is the time that it has taken between the critical
scientific advance and the widespread deployment of the resulting
weapon systems. It took around 40 years between the building of the
first steamboat, the first submarine and the flight of the first
aircraft, and the subsequent deployment of effective forces of steam-
powered warships, U-boats and aircraft carriers respectively. For
guided weapon destroyers and nuclear submarines the timescale was
nearer 20 years. There are no indications that the gestation period
is shortening. Indeed since the advent of the nuclear submarine
developments have been incremental in capability rather than
revolutionary. While hovercraft, helicopters, and hydrofoils have
produced novel opportunities, they have not changed the nature of
maritime warfare in the sense that the previous examples have. An
examination of the current areas of research will indicate which
offer the greatest benefits in future naval warfare.</P>
