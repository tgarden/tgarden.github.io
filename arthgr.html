<P>Any reference to the Home Guard is guaranteed to bring a smile. It
is not as though the men of the Home Guard were ever given an
opportunity to prove themselves in battle: there are many more
distinguished units that had actual disasters in war. Did the 
television comedy series, Dad's Army, destroy the post-War reputation
of a dedicated home defence organisation? By coincidence, this book
arrived for review as the VE celebrations were coming to their
climax. I looked in vain for events commemorating the Home Guard war
effort. It seems Churchill was mistaken in forecasting that: "History
will say that your share in the greatest of all our struggles for
freedom was a vitally important one". On the other hand, he had to
say something heartening as he stood down the Home Guard after its
brief four years of existence.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Professor MacKenzie has written a serious analysis of the policy
history of the Home Guard.  In many ways this well researched,
cross-referenced, academic study shows that the saga of this
volunteer force was funnier and more confused than any scriptwriter
could invent. Yet the topic is an important one, not just for the
historian but also for today's military planner. How were the
allocation of priorities made between the front line combat forces
and this last ditch defending army of civilians? Was the operational
concept sensible? Did the existence of such a force have a deterrent
effect on the enemy?</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The force that we now know as the Home Guard came into being in
almost literally one day in 1940. The extraordinary combination of
public hysteria over the possibility of invasion, the springing up of
unregulated militias and the outcry from the Great and Good, all led
to an inevitable political response. On 14 May 1940, Anthony Eden
announced that recruiting had begun for a new force to be known as
Local Defence Volunteers - the LDV. It was perhaps not surprising
that there was only a sketchy view of what the LDV should actually
do. There was talk of both a counter-invasion requirement and also
detection of fifth columnists. The critical staff work had been done
in the previous 24 hours, and that from a position where the
operational army commander had a completely different concept from
the War Office. Neither had bothered to clear such details as cost
with the Treasury, and this caused subsequent difficulties which the
modern Whitehall Warrior would recognise.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>With such a chaotic start, it is scarcely  surprising that the
first enthusiasm of the volunteers quickly waned . The lack of
uniforms, weapons and training syllabus makes them question the
Government's commitment. These problems are exacerbated by the nature
of the LDV membership: a high proportion of the volunteers has seen
service in the previous war. Former officers enlist as soldiers (the
Kensington-Belgravia unit had some 8 retired generals), and are not
slow to indicate, on the basis of their vast previous experience, the
shortcomings of higher authority. It rapidly becomes apparent that
the Government in responding to one political difficulty (the need to
respond to invasion fear) has created a new more articulate and
influential  pressure group. At this stage, the LDV might have next
to no military utility, but it carries great political weight and is
not bound by the normal restraints of military hierarchy.  Soon,
matters become so difficult that Churchill focuses on the new force;
and his personal interest hardly makes things easier for those
charged with bringing it into being. He argues with Eden over the
title, and forces through, against considerable opposition, a change
in name from Local Defence Volunteers to the Home Guard. He gives
priority to uniforms and weapons.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>By the time that the Home Guard is in reasonable military order,
and has a better allocation of weapons, the threat of invasion has
totally passed. Now the problem is to keep the members motivated.
There are arguments in Cabinet about the diversion  of 1.8 million
men to playing soldiers when the country desperately needs to
increase industrial production.  The author is generous in his
conclusions, believing that the advantages to national morale and the
releasing of regular soldiers from guarding duties outweighed the
costs. He accepts that there is no evidence to show the existence of
the Home Guard had any effect on German invasion plans. To many it
will seem that MacKenzie's catalogue of muddled professional advice,
political posturing and misallocation of  scarce resources during a
war of survival is a lesson for the future. His tailpiece on the
short-lived successor Home Guard of the early 50's suggests that few
of the lessons had been learned.</P>
