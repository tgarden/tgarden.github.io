			<p>The utility of force: The art of war in the modern world</p>
			<p>by General Sir Rupert Smith</p>
			<p>published 2005 by Allan Lane pp428 &pound;25</p>
			<p>isbn 0-713-99836-9</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The United States is&nbsp; spending over $500 billion this year on it military capability. The European nations, including Britain, invest another $150 billion on their armies, navies and air forces.&nbsp; Despite all this, the military is stretched thinly across the globe, and at home there is a greater sense of insecurity. General Sir Rupert Smith, in a very personal assessment, tries to explain from a historical perspective why it is all going wrong. As he says: &quot;Since the end of the Cold War force has been used time and time again, yet failed to achieve the result expected.&quot;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;Rupert Smith is widely acknowledged to have been the right man at the right time as the world changed in the aftermath of the end of the Cold War. Between 1990 and 2001, he commanded successively an armoured division in the first Gulf War, UN forces in Bosnia, British forces in Northern Ireland, and finally was the Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe with both NATO and EU command responsibilities. These experiences, coupled with senior Ministry of Defence and Staff College posts, have shaped a thoughtful analysis of how war and conflict have changed. His basic thesis is that we no longer fight industrial wars. The last such war of survival between states was the second world war. Since then we have been engaged in conflicts and confrontations, which he labels as war amongst the people. He argues that decision&#150;makers and publics alike are stuck in a time warp of old thinking. We describe our current security problems in the language of old warfare, and more importantly structure our forces and strategy to fight long past campaigns.</p>
			<p>The book is a wide ranging history of warfare, but is very different from the usual academic heavy volumes. One moment, we are examining the&nbsp; development of industrial scale support in the American Civil War, and then jump to personal recollections of the circumstances in the Kosovo air campaign of 1999. This weaving of military history with personal experience makes for a powerful narrative. The book is not primarily for armchair generals, but should be studied by those who wish to understand what military force can do, and how it should be used.</p>
			<p>It would be useful if those politicians, who seem so keen to deploy soldiers, understood a little more the lessons of the past. The first chapter on understanding force should be required reading for high office. Here the relationship between the political objective and the military strategy is described. Smith highlights the triangular relationship&nbsp; between the desired end state, the ways that it can be achieved, and the means that are necessary.</p>
			<p>The main meat of the book is divided into three parts, with a section on interstate industrial wars, the Cold War and finally his wars amongst the people. Each is of interest, and useful as a primer of military history. However, for those who want answers to today's problems, the final section is the most important. In modern conflicts and confrontations, he argues that objectives are different from clear victories of the past. Rather, we now seek to establish conditions favourable to a desired outcome. We rarely fight on the formal battlefield, and the conflicts may be unending. We preserve our forces rather than risk them for strategic advantage. Weapons and structures of old style industrial warfare have to be adapted to the new tasks for which they are not designed. The participants are a complex mix of non-state actors and multinational players.</p>
			<p>Not only do our armed forces try to uses the tools of industrial warfare in this war amongst the people, Smith argues that our Whitehall structures reinforce the problem. Of the nation state ministries of foreign affairs and defence he says: &quot;Their very being, and therefore world vision, is predicated on industrial war&quot;.&nbsp; This leads to difficulties in gathering intelligence, formulating the right objectives, limiting risks, coordination of effort, and perhaps most importantly maintaining the will to succeed. Earlier in the book, Smith produces a somewhat arguable formula for measuring capability in terms of means, ways and will. However, as he shows in the example of Somalia in 1993, a weak warlord could defeat the mighty USA which lacked the will to continue.&nbsp; Often&nbsp; insurgents have more capability because their will is stronger, and our industrial warfighting means are of little relevance.</p>
			<p>Inevitably the reader will look for solutions to our current problems in Iraq. Smith is not defeatist, and argues that military force can still be used effectively. But for it to be useful, there must be a clearly understood desired outcome, which all participants can work towards. For this reader, the lack of such clarity has been the flaw with Iraq policy throughout as objectives have changed to suit the changing political agenda. If security thinking does not change, there are more disasters ahead.</p>
