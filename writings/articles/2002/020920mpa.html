			<h3>Change and the Military</h3>
		</div>
		<address><font size="2">Sir Timothy Garden KCB is a visiting professor at the Centre for Defence Studies, King&#146;s College London. He spent 32 years in the RAF as a pilot. About a third of his career was spent in the MOD. He was responsible for the post-Cold War downsizing of the RAF, and went on as Assistant Chief of Defence Staff to be responsible for planning the future size and shape of all three services. His final military post was Air Marshal Commandant of the Royal College of Defence Studies. In 1997, he became Director of the Royal Institute of International Affairs at Chatham House</font></address>
		<h3>Who Are the Military?</h3>
		<p><br>The numbers employed in the military were been reduced during the 1980s and 90s and you may be surprised at how small the armed services now are. At the end of World War II, the Royal Air Force had about 1 million men. Now the service is down to 55,000. The Royal Navy numbers 43,000 and the Army 100,000. There are about 200,000 people in regular uniform. In discussing the armed forces, we should not forget the civilian component, which is equally influenced by change. Indeed, the civilian component has been experiencing as much change as the military. The civilian component numbers 100,000, down from 300,000 around 15 years ago. The balance between civilians and military has also been changing, which can in itself produce tensions and cause problems.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			The total budget of the military is &pound;24 billion a year which is about 2.3 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). That is down from the mid-1980s, when it was over 5 per cent of GDP. There has been a significant fall in the allocation of government spending on defence over a relatively short period. The Ministry of Defence are now moving from a cash accounting system to a resource accounting system (which no one understands). Even the man who implemented the change said that he was one of the four people in the Ministry of Defence who did understood it. Furthermore he was not going to tell anyone else. The &pound;24 billion figure now looks more like becoming &pound;30 billion. Gordon Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, boasted about an extra &pound;3.5 billion for defence in his strategic spending review. Needless to say, it does not work like that when you are accounting in different ways. Those who work in the finance business will understand.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			The resource accounting system lets us look at the true costs of ownership. Despite cuts and reductions, the military are still a significant spender of taxpayers&#146; money. Unlike the Chinese, British forces do not set up shops to earn extra money. A recent article in the Financial Times reckoned that three-quarters of the Indonesian defence budget came from the entrepreneurial activities of their officers. They sell all manner of things, including protection!</p>
		<h3>Drivers for Change</h3>
		<p>Let me now enumerate the driver for change. First, threats. The threats have their equivalent in the range of businesses that are represented in MPA. Some threats emerge over a period of time, and those are to some extent predictable: we respond to them through forward planning. Then there are shock threats, like Osama bin Laden and the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. The government will need to know what the military can do to respond to threats. Some threats are purely short term, such as the threatened firemen&#146;s strike which happens every 25 years or so when the Green God-desses (the fire engines used by the army) have to be wheeled out by soldiers to fight fires.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Technology is a colossal driver for change in the military. We like to believe, in some cases falsely, that the military operates at the frontiers of technology. They certainly attempt to exploit technology. Because they are such small purchasers in terms of overall numbers or units, the cost of technology tends to be high. In the past when the militaries were big (and this is still perhaps true of the US where the resources are so much greater), the military could drive civilian technology. There were benefits for the civilian market from the development of military technology, certain elements of which could be transferred to the civilian; however, the flow today is generally in the other direction. The great surge forward in mass systems of computers in the civil market is exploited by the military as far as they can.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Government is a major driver for change, as anyone who works in the public sector will know. Governments and ministers change, and these changes have sharp repercussions for the military. New ministers arriving in a department may have a brave new scheme that they are going to impose to make their name. In defence, the military would have to change and react to such shiny new schemes. That is certainly true across the wider public sector and has been true at various times in the military. It is not necessarily a hindrance, but if ministers change too frequently, it can become bewildering.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Society changes, too. This produces difficulties of its own, as the military have to react in a measured way to social change. On the one hand, the military cannot be so alien from the society they are defending that no one wants to join to them. On the other, if the values of society are very different from ours or if young people are not up to the demands made on those joining the military, we also have a problem. The military have had problems in the past when they have lagged too far behind changes in society. Armed forces everywhere are conservative and reluctant to adopt each fad or fashion as it breaks, but the forces must still look at the trends in society, which can affect the retention of its people.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Resources&#151;or perhaps I should say lack of them&#151;are the biggest driver for change. Defence spending has been significantly reduced since the end of the Cold War. In the comprehensive spending review, the Chancellor extolled the fact that defence was to be given an extra &pound;3.5 billion. However, as the small print shows, in real terms defence spending will remain level between 1997 and 2003. The additional spend is helpful, since resources were declining so much before, but defence spending is still continuing to decline as a percentage of GDP.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			The problem here is that manpower costs and the availability of labour are not independent of what is going on in the rest of society. Members of the armed forces come from the same pool of people from which industry and government recruit. In the commercial sector, pay reflects productivity and therefore tends to rise at the same rate as GDP. With defence spending remaining level in real terms, the manpower bill gets progressively less affordable. At the same time, equipment costs rise at a rate above inflation, with each new generation. This is because the high-tech equipment is purchased in small numbers and because our procurement system is poor. Conse-quently, the pressure on resources is remorseless. If we do extraordinarily well with the Chancellor, in peace time our spending remains at best level in real terms; and our capabilities are being knocked away all the time. We need to improve our efficiency all the time and think of more exciting ways to do things. In other words, we have to increase our productivity. This is another major force for change. However, some of the tasks that the militaries do are not really open to productivity increases. These tasks depend on numbers. You could not have half a soldier patrolling the streets in Belfast. To be effective, a certain number of people are needed in Bosnia or to drive Green Goddesses&#151;the fire engines&#151;in the event of a strike.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			The UK forces have to work with other nations or allies (we can no longer do everything on our own). In particular, we have to work with the US. They have it all. Our Prime Minister also likes to feel he has the ear of the current President of the United States. To work with the US, the Prime Minister has to be prepared to make a contribution on the hardware side, not just utter diplomatic rhetoric. It is accepted that we need to operate with allies and consequently that we may have drivers for change that are not of our own making or of our own choice. Hard choices have to be made to ensure that we remain plugged in with other nations, predominantly the United States.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			The military learn from experience and their operations. These lessons are fed back into the system and themselves become drivers for change. We also learn from business. The military now use a much more business-like model and we do this in a number of different ways. The way that other organizations operate has lessons for us and we have been learning from them.</p>
		<h3>Recent Examples of Change</h3>
		<p>Let me give you some recent examples to demonstrate the spread of changes that come from those drivers. The end of the Cold War was responsible for a major change, which is something that we in the military could not control. Of course we are happy about it, but as a result, we have seen the political desire for a peace dividend. <br>
		</p>
		<p>
			It has also meant new tasks for us. There is no longer a static confrontation between East and West, as more and more of former enemies in the Warsaw Pact become part of NATO. Most that are not will get offers in Prague in November 2002. NATO has an alliance with Russia. That has caused a dramatic change in our business model, to which we have had to react.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			What is our new management strategy (NMS)? Just before the end of the Cold War, the Thatcherite view which led to some restructuring in government organizations percolated through to defence. The UK military took a leading position in these new practices, as it experimented with agencies and, in particular, with putting lines of financial accountability with lines of operational responsibility. <br>
		</p>
		<p>
			This was a huge change. In the past, the military had fired the bullets and won the wars, and someone in headquarters had paid the bills. This is no longer the case. Now military commanders at every level have to set their budget and deliver to it. They benefit in the new year&#146;s funding if they can find clever ways of doing the same for less. At the end of each year, they are subject to review of achievement and budget.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Contractorization is one of the ways in which the military has coped with the problem of decreasing resources. Typically, in the early stages of contractorization, we found that operations cost 25 per cent less than those provided in-house. We thought we were efficient and dedicated, but if we train someone to be a cook in the mess, we are also training him to be a soldier. He also has to be trained in how to cope with nuclear and biological defence. He may be promoted through the ranks. Finally he is given a military pension. Expensive military training is not necessary for someone who, in practice, works as a cook. It is far less expensive to use a contract company to provide the meals. It is not always easy to decide how best to use contractors, but the UK is in the lead in going down the contractorization road. This week I was at NATO headquarters in Brussels: normally you get a rather sleepy Italian soldier on the gate, but this time we had Group 4 security. The message is getting through.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			There was discussion at one time as to how militaries would evolve in Europe after the Cold War, but the Balkans changed the thinking about what the militaries were for. More emphasis was put on humanitarian and peace-keeping operations. That constituted a huge change from the Cold War: nuclear bombers are not much use for keeping the warring factions apart in Bosnia-Herzegovina. That has been one of the slower drivers for change, as we have learned lessons on the ground in the Balkans, where throughout the 1990s Western forces gained expertise. Although UK troops had had plenty of experience in Northern Ireland, our Balkans experience started in a shaky way. UN peace-keeping operations were the flavour of the 1990s.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Network-centric warfare is the buzzword of military defence at the moment. The American military describe themselves as being in transformation, as everything is digitized. Although the technology that goes with it is immature, we need the same technology if we are to work with US forces. A network-centric warfare system, with its unmanned vehicles flying overhead, produces data which feeds into a fusion centre which then disseminates it. The soldier then knows not only where he is but also where the enemy is. It also allows the US President and the UK Prime Minister to see what is happening. Micro-management, of course, has its minuses as well as its pluses.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			The Strategic Defence Review of 1997&#150;98, under the Minister of Defence, George Robertson, brought about major changes. In fact there have been four major reviews since the end of the Cold War, together with some minor reviews. Some were about resources or re-balancing the programme when it gets too far adrift from reality; others were about the change in threat. However, the Strategic Defence Review was the main review and shaped the forces for the next 15 years. That has resulted in more mobile forces that can be used to project power further away.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			The Northern Ireland Peace Process is another example of change. Northern Ireland has been a long-standing commitment for the British Army in support of the police. The numbers have gone up and down over the years. We have to manage these fluctuations, although the training of soldiers takes a matter of years. Once the Peace Process is implemented, these soldiers (numbering 12,000 to 15,000) will no longer be needed there. Even the tasks we think we know about have requirements that fluctuate all the time.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			The question of women in combat represents a major cultural change for the armed forces, who have agonized long and hard on the matter. The Army found it difficult to determine how they would operate in contact battle with a mixed unit. In 1977, when I was a staff officer in the Ministry of Defence, we were short of pilots. We suddenly realized that  we could double the pool by inviting women to be pilots. There was a reaction of shock horror in the MOD, and the senior doctor in the Air Force produced a paper to show that it was physiologically impossible for a women to be a fast jet pilot. <br>
		</p>
		<p>
			The following year the Russians blasted a women into space, which rather undermined the argument, but it took us another 20 years to get to the stage where society had changed, along with the people at the top. The personal experience of the senior people making the policy decisions had an important influence on the progress of change. When we finally cleared all aircraft&#151;combat and non-combat&#151;for women to be pilots and air crew, I had to explain (as Assistant Chief of the Air Staff) to the Assistant Chief of the General Staff that the Air Force would not be able to obey his rule for combat operations in the forward edge of the battle area where women were not allowed. I informed him that I would not be able to tell whether it would be a man or a woman flying the helicopter to transport the troops. His troops therefore had a choice: they could either be flown by the woman (if the pilot turned out to be a woman) or they could walk.</p>
		<h3>Introducing Change in the Military</h3>
		<p>Everyone always assumes that, in the military, senior officers have only to decide what the change is to be and give an order for everything to happen. In practice, change does not happen like that in the military. We employ highly intelligent, technically qualified people who have a choice as to what they ultimately do in their careers. This is not a conscript army, navy or air force. The military consists of a set of people who do their jobs voluntarily. They are a rather special group of people and you have to take them with you when you want change. To do that, we need to know how to implement change in a way that will make them more effective. We have an organization that allows us to do that.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			I understand all the management thinking about flat organizations, whereby the many levels of middle managers are not needed. The military, however, is not like that. It is still quite Victorian. Military organizations are hierarchical and need to be for good military reasons. Most notably, the armed forces have to be hierarchical in the operational world.<br>
			
			This hierarchical organization provides an advantage when you are looking at change. It means that you can consult up and down the chain of command, with information moving up and down the organization rapidly to the people who will be affected. That is a bonus when you want to implement change. You can use the organization in order to make sure that the change works and that you are getting the necessary feedback.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			It is not perfect, but no organization is. Within the organization of the armed forces, there is a depth of loyalty among the service people which is unusual anywhere else. That helps when it comes to change management. But it is has to be taken seriously into account when you implement change, because it is all too easy to undermine loyalty. I remember a redundancy scheme that came out in 1978 that was handled very poorly indeed. Compulsory redundancy notices were sent out, leading to a complete fiasco. It took us 15 years to recover from the effects of that badly handled redundancy scheme. It is all well and good to say that the people who were made redundant are long gone; those who remain remember what happened to their mates. Post-Cold War redundancies have been handled in a more sensitive manner. Loyalty is something that should not be thrown away.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			The sense of discipline found in the military is a great advantages when change is introduced. If you tell a military person (and this embraces the civilian side to some extent) to do something, that person has a willingness to carry it out because he has been told to do it after he has been consulted. On an operation, of course, the order is carried out immediately. If you are a navigator and the pilot of the aeroplane says, &#147;eject&#148;, you don&#146;t hold a seminar on the whys and wherefores. You eject. But if you are planning and implementing long-term change, you would hold your seminar group.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, and again very positively, when you implement change in the military, you will find a can-do approach. Although this is generally a plus, it can occasionally be a minus. The military will by and large try to make whatever you want to do work, however crazy it may be. They will most often succeed. They may not do it in the way that the formal organization chart predicted, but they will manipulate it in a such a way as to make the scheme work, whatever it is. This is a drawback if the scheme is not as robust as it should be, and (to be candid) hare-brained schemes, which should not work, can be made to work well enough and so gain acceptance. This may not be all to the good.</p>
		<h3>Problems Associated with Change in the Military</h3>
		<p>Some of the problems in the management of change in the military are particularly acute. This is because we need respond urgently to threats even at a period of major organizational change. In 1991 when we were implementing the great post-Cold War defence review under Tom King, who was then Minister of Defence, and reducing our forces by a third, we found ourselves fighting a war in the Gulf at the same time. Squadrons returned from missions in which they had lost Tornados and then had to go back to Germany for the disbandment parade of that same squadron. A situation like that can be difficult to manage.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			The military culture can be a minus at times. If you spend your life training in order to make your unit survive and win in war, you tend to carry on that particular culture when it comes to changes in the organization that might mean your unit will disappear. There is no one as fierce as the colonel commandant whose regiment is in line to disappear in the latest defence review. There is a degree of conservatism that is appropriate when you are a military man. The military are often more cautious than their political masters. That is apparent in the case of Iraq, because we know the implications and the downside. If things are working well as they stand, you have to ask whether change is going to improve them. You have to convince people that any change is worth doing.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			The military has its own culture when dealing with its future. How do you have external representation of the workers? In the civilian world, there are trade unions. As we do not have trade unions, commanders are often placed in the difficult position of trying to implement change and convince their subordinates change is needed, as well as being, in effect, trade union representatives and communicating upwards the drawbacks, difficulties and resentments that the changes are causing.<br>
		</p>
		<p>More and more the personnel in the armed forces focus on what they do. They are specialists: a Tornado pilot, a gunner or a submariner, for example. But change needs to take account of the whole organization and ensure that the services get the spread of expertise that that they need. This can be difficult to reconcile with the needs of career management and changes at the top. Policy makers at the top change very frequently and the best people do not spend much time at any one place. This means that when change is being implemented, there is a lack of continuity in the management. We have not solved that issue, which remains a problem.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Governments and ministers change relatively quickly and so does policy. The timescales needed to implement a major change may be five years, by which time the minister who instigated it may be in the House of Lords or writing his memoirs. The current minister may not be interested in the outcome of that particular change.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Public money is a problem. We do not have an entrepreneurial fund and you cannot bet on a new enterprise, as it were, by dipping into a pot of money set aside for entrepreneurial purposes&#151;although the Public Accounts Committee might say that that the military does indeed &#147;have a go&#148; some of the time.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Output measurement is difficult in the military. We have even engaged management consultants to advise us on it. It is difficult because output is about whether we are going to be able to do what the government wants us to do, and do so successfully, under widely varying circumstances. In order to measure our output, we end up measuring what we can measure. There are concerns that you can distort your activities by the process of measurement, if you use performance criteria across the whole range of activities. We have a business-like approach, as each commander bids for his budget. He also has a set of performance criteria to meet for that budget. The performance criteria are for elements that are measurable. Yet to an extent the military is not measurable in that way.</p>
		<h3>Implementation of Change</h3>
		<p>Implementation of change in the military is not greatly different from what is done in a change management programme in business. Consultation is the crux of all of this. It is essential to bring the workforce along, because they also have ideas. If you involve your specialists in the planning process, they begin to take ownership of it and will then deliver it much better.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			In training and education, we are lucky in the military. We have always spent a huge amount of time in training our personnel. What else can we do with our people when they are not at war or driving fire engines? We have plenty of training establishments and it is in our blood to train. You do not have to create a special course when you move to a new organizational system. You can simply feed it into all the course training activities which everyone is accustomed to. You can rapidly change the thinking about how the organization works.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Feedback and lessons learned are the most important of all. We have a great tradition of seeking feedback and acting on it. There is honest reporting of the lessons learnt while implementing the changes. That means you can tweak the process of change to make it better. The situation is a little more difficult now, as the media love to get hold of a leaked copy of a post-exercise report and claim that the army is in disarray because tanks break down in a particular type of desert. This type of feedback is hugely useful to have before you go to war, when you can do something about it.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Performance measurement has a role to play, despite my criticisms. You will want to know if your new system is giving you better output or whether it is giving you the same output for less money. In other words, are you increasing your efficiency? <br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, how do we reward our personnel? We do not have the ability to give performance-related bonuses to our senior management, as we are in a public sector activity. How do we reward those who come up with the ideas for change and deliver them? They are the ones who make change work. We reward them by our promotional system within the military. That is quite variable but people know how it operates. The ethos of the military also means that the reward is gained subsequently through the improved operation of the unit.</p>
		<h3>Lessons</h3>
		<p>What are the lessons can be drawn from change management in the military? First, we have to convince our political masters that they need to invest in the change. We need to make any savings targets as soon as is practical, but often we are not prepared to put up the investment to get the long-term savings.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are contemplating change you have to do it over a realistic timescale. Results are often required far too quickly, especially with high-profile political changes. Rapid results are not always possible in a short timescale, and you must strike a balance between delivering change and having the time to modify the process as it goes along, when drawbacks may emerge and have to be remedied. <br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Communication is essential. You have to communicate up and down all the time if you are going to carry your people. To an outsider, it may seem unnecessary to carry your people with you. Does it matter in the military whether you do or not? Yes, it does, because your people can just walk out.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			A huge number of changes have been implemented over the last 10&#150;15 years. Operational changes have meant that people are away from home more. The financial changes and the policy changes have affected promotion chances over time and retaining people is the most difficult challenge for us at the moment.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Like communication, honesty is essential. Honesty must underpin communication. It is no good communicating up and down if people come to know in a year&#146;s time that what you said is nonsense. You will lose trust if you fail to be honest. There is a tendency, all too human, to give the good side of the story, without being honest about the bad side.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Tracking effects and learning lessons are important. You cannot just set change in place and forget about it. You must find out whether what you expected to happen has indeed happened. If it has not, you have to find out why and make sure it does happen. <br>
			
			Change must be regularly reviewed. Our organizations are full of people with more expertise than the people at top can ever have, as they change their jobs so frequently during the course of their military careers. We have to draw on that expertise to make the people feel valued and, yet more important, to get a better solution. <br>
		</p>
		<p>
			It is important to use the expertise within the organization. Only when you do not have the expertise should you to go outside. There is a view in Whitehall that management consultants will give an honest answer, however impenetrable it might be. But management consultants have to learn your business before they can give you this honest answer. Not using the expertise you already have is much resented inside the military. As I have said several times, you have to carry your people if you want the change to work. I would therefore caution against the use of external consultants, except where you clearly lack the expertise. We have sometimes lacked the expertise, for example in the transition to business practices in the use of PFI and so on. In areas like this, one may have to bring in the experts to help, but the salvation of an organization can be often found by looking within it.<br>
