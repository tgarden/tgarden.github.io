<H3><CENTER>Keeping the Peace at NATO's Birthday Party</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER>by Sir Timothy Garden </CENTER></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation came into being with the
signing of the treaty in Washington on 4 April 1949.  At the end of
April 1999, 50 years later,  NATO is holding a summit again in
Washington. For the first four decades there was little difficulty in
defining the purpose of NATO as a defensive alliance of western
democracies clubbing together to provide collective security against
a real and urgent threat from an ideologically distinct adversary
armed with nuclear weapons. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the
end of the Warsaw Pact, which had been set up to counter NATO, left
the Alliance with a more diffuse set of aims. To the surprise of
many, NATO has thrived in the post Cold War world. It is a club which
has a clamouring crowd of prospective new members. It has been
redefining its rationale, streamlining its internal organisation,
carrying out complex politico-military tasks, and setting up a range
of relationships with former opponent states. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	The summit in Washington from 23 to 25 April is designed to
celebrate the most successful military alliance of all time. It is
also an occasion for looking to the future and defining its new role.
There are a number of difficulties with this agenda. The centrepiece
for the summit should be the formulation of a new strategic concept.
NATO last produced a  strategic concept in 1991 to adjust to the end
of the Cold War. Yet  the world has changed greatly since then, and
that concept looks very dated already. In the 1990's NATO has found
itself involved in the Balkans, in various roles. The Gulf War has
shown how coalitions of the willing are still required to act on
behalf of the United Nations to restore international order. While
the raison d'etre of NATO remains the collective defence of member
nations  (an attack on one is an attack on all), this is an ever more
remote possibility. Yet voters in each of the states expect their
armies to be able to something about the horrors that they see on
their television screens. The only effective military alliance in the
world is NATO, and it provides the essential infrastructure,
procedures and training to allow multinational forces to act together
on operations. The new strategic concept must recognise this new
mission.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	There are however a number of elements of the future vision for
NATO on which its members take rather different views. The United
States is the dominant partner both as the remaining superpower and
also as the provider of the most advanced military capabilities. The
US view of its responsibilities for international order find echoes
with UK policy, but less so with other European allies. Some of these
would wish to spell out the mechanism by which any NATO operation
would be legitimised through the UN or OSCE. The US would prefer to
leave open the prospect of NATO self-authorising some missions.
Indeed, many would argue that the current NATO threats to bomb
Serbian targets over Kosovo are an indication of a new approach by
NATO. There is also a debate to be conducted over the geographical
area of NATO's interest. In the Cold War there was no problem. NATO
was defined by the boundaries of its member states. Now as it moves
into undertaking operations to promote peace and security, the
boundaries are less well defined. The Balkans are seen as important
for European security and intervention is justified on those grounds.
The Middle East and North Africa could certainly be included in such
a wider definition. The Russians, already uncomfortable over the
increase in NATO membership, worry about the potential for future
NATO interest in their own troubled areas.  The US, taking a global
view, would wish to have NATO take a broader view of its security
interests. Proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and
international terrorism will be high on the agenda. Again the US,
feeling newly threatened, will look to pre-emptive solutions with or
without the help of NATO. The Europeans, who are more used to the
problems of terrorists and nuclear threats, will be less comfortable
with NATO taking on this role.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Many had thought that the NATO summit would be both a chance to
welcome the three new members, Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic, and also to announce the next tranche of prospective
members. It is clear that there is little enthusiasm for an
announcement about further enlargement. This will cause
disappointment in Slovenia and Romania in particular. While there
will be pleasant words about the door remaining open to more members,
it will signal a change of pace to the development of NATO.  
Doubtless, there will be much work in hand to provide added benefits
through Partnership for Peace, but it may not be enough to satisfy
the disappointed applicants. An added complication comes from the
moves that are afoot to absorb the WEU into the EU. While this has
much to commend it from both a bureaucratic and a European Defence
aspect, it raises some particular problems for a number of states.
Turkey, Norway and Iceland ( plus the 3 new NATO member states) worry
that the EU is looking to be one half of NATO to match the US as the
other half. They fear that their influence will be diminished by
being outside of the EU. In this respect Turkey is a particular
problem given its current poor relations with the EU.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Over the years, worries about the viability of NATO have always
centred on the long term commitment of the United States. The
Washington Summit has fallen at an unfortunate time. Relationships
between Europe and the US are beset by a range of difficulties. On
the trade front, the WTO dispute over bananas is the precursor to
even worse disputes over genetically modified food and growth hormone
beef imports. The outcome of the court martial of the US Marine Corps
pilot who hit the cable car in Italy has outraged Italian opinion. In
Germany, the government is deeply angered by the refusal of the CIA
to give up Stasi files removed from Berlin, and has also taken the
execution of a German national in the US badly. The UK and France are
likely to find themselves in dispute with the US government over
prospective bans on Concorde flights into US airports. Although
these, and other disputes, are not directly relevant to sorting out
the future role for NATO, they will undoubtedly colour the approaches
that ministers take. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	NATO is a consensus organisation and the lateness of the
negotiations on the new strategic concept  suggest that the final
document is unlikely to be radical, but may exacerbate transatlantic
tensions. We can expect a bland document which reflects on NATO's
past triumphs and generalises about its future purpose. I shall
review what is actually decided, and the implications, in my next
article at the end of April after the Summit.</P>
