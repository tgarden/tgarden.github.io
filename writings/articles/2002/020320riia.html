			<h3>Security and the War Against Terrorism</h3>
			<h4>The Military Dimension</h4>

			<h3>The Limitations of Military Actions</h3>
			<p>We have become focused on the military aspects of the campaign against terrorism that followed the tragic attacks of 11 September. This is inevitable because military response is visible and reassures our publics that robust action is being taken to counter the new frightening threat to their safety. Unfortunately, the quick military campaign can only make a very limited contribution to the long term threat reduction. I shall try to give some sense of the limitations of the military dimension of the war against terrorism, and also indicate where I think armed forces have most to offer. It is a personal view, and it is clear that different governments are coming up with different priorities already.</p>
			<h3>The New Terrorism</h3>
			<p>Terrorism was with us long before 11 September 2001, some of it motivated by local political aims, some by single issue fanaticism, and some by unfathomable beliefs. Suicide bombers were not new. What is different is the targeting on a global scale of targets designed to cause casualties without limit and to undermine the global economy. They might be called strategic acts of destruction, rather than the tactical terrorist acts of the past. While it may have been possible for the international community to live with occasional acts of local terrorism around the world, it is much more difficult to live with non-state actors who have a mission to destroy a large part of the global system. <br>
				<br>
				The events of Tuesday 11 September demonstrated that it is now possible to cause mass destruction (in the technical sense of thousands of immediate casualties), economic panic  and the dispersal of the main organs of government with no more than a Stanley knife. The skies are filled with thousands of airliners at any given moment. Modern society has produced new vulnerabilities in its infrastructure arrangements.</p>
			<h3>Priority Actions</h3>
			<p>The priority must be to defend the most vulnerable targets and to arrest the in-place trained operatives before they can carry out new atrocities. These are jobs which belong primarily to the intelligence and police agencies around the world. Sharing information on a global basis is the only way to respond to a global threat. The military may have a role in the defensive measures. Particularly if there is a likelihood of the use of chemical, biological or radiological agents in any terrorist attack. The only organisation trained and equipped for coping with such an attack tends to be the military. What is called now in the US &quot;Consequence Management&quot; should certainly be one of the tasks for military units. Discussion in the UK is turning on whether this would be an appropriate tasks for Reserve forces.</p>
			<h3>Military Force at a distance</h3>
			<p>The role with which the military is much more comfortable is that of taking the battle away from home and to the terrorist. This is not easy given the dispersed nature of international terrorist networks. Finding and eliminating the direct supporting infrastructure of the terrorist or his  sponsor is an appealing task for armed forces , and in many ways shaped the military campaign in Afghanistan.</p>
			<p>Nevertheless it is difficult. The use of $2 million cruise missiles  to take out a camel and a tent was a real problem in Afhganistan. Given good intelligence, carefully targeted air attacks and small but capable western ground forces, co-operating with indigenous forces, the bin Laden infrastructure has been effectively dismantled within the borders of Afghanistan.  Some European states had useful niche capabilities in intelligence gathering, and in specialist operations which can be helpful to what is inevitably primarily a US effort. Capturing bin Laden himself continues to depend on good luck as much as anything. As we have seen in the search for Bosnian war criminals, the military is not that good at detective work.</p>
			<h3>Military as a Stabilising Force</h3>
			<p>The security problem in Afghanistan is now more about rebuilding it to be a functioning state for the future, rather than its role as a source of terrorists, and there is a real role for the military in post-conflict rebuilding. Indeed it is recovering failed states that will be a part of the long term answer to terrorism. The indirect support by States of terrorist organisations requires many different approaches. The circumstances in Afghanistan are now right to make life better for the people and thus stop the growth of yet more recruits for international terrorism. Certainly providing a government that can bring the rule of law and dispense humanitarian aid must be a priority, and it will be a role in which a significant international military presence is likely to be needed for some time. One of the concerns at present is the difficulty in raising sufficient peacekeeping forces. 5000 troops to secure Kabul is not a full answer. As we have seen in the Balkans, it is easier to generate forces for the conflict phase than it is for the arguably more important rebuilding phase.<br>
				<br>
				However, success in the military campaign  has not removed the threat from the already trained and deployed terrorists. Bringing al-Qaeda members, captured in Afghanistan, to justice is important, but we should not delude ourselves that the world will return to normal just because we have done that. Indeed if we do not do that in a way which appears fair and just to the rest of the world, we may make the situation worse in the future. Observation of international law norms is an obligation on all nations, including the US.</p>
			<h3>Counter-Terrorism Strategy</h3>
			<p>In the military and diplomatic field a difficult two pronged approach will be necessary. The remaining  members of this terror group must be identified and removed from action. At the same time, the attractions of becoming a member of such a group must be reduced. A large scale disproportionate military response will generate many new recruits for the terrorists, as Israel has found over the last year. Good intelligence is the key to any operation. In order to get intelligence quickly, the  West will need to seek the co-operation of the states which have in the past hosted terrorist factions. This will be a difficult trick to turn. If the whereabouts of the perpetrators are identified, the whole international community can move effectively. An alliance of many nations would support the USA in taking necessary action to extradite, eliminate or capture those responsible. <br>
				<br>
				The quick successful campaign in Afghanistan, which ousted the Taliban government will have served as a warning to any other states which might think of support for international terrorism. If a more general military campaign is launched against those states, which the USA classifies as supporters of terrorism, then the outcome will be much less satisfactory. Whatever the outcome of such a campaign, the world will be a less safe place for everyone in the future. Difficult as it is, this is a time to build alliances and take joint action as American, European, Arab, Asian and African partners against a universal threat. It is difficult to see how a major operation against Iraq (or Iran or North Korea) would reduce the threat to the West from al-Qaeda style terrorism. <br>
				<br>
				A US official soon after 11 September claimed that &#147;Offence is the best defence&#148;. While this can be true in traditional wars, it has not always been the best approach to counter-terrorism in the past. The traditional terrorist organisation seeks the status that comes from engaging the full might of national armies, and thrives on the fallout from disproportionate reaction by government. No one doubts that the US can field the most powerful military capability that the world has ever known. Nor are there any doubts that on this occasion the political and public will to support military action is strong. Minimising potential casualties will for once not be a major issue in terms of operational planning. Coalition partners in NATO and beyond will be invited to fit in where they can. But their presence will be, for the most part, of more political significance than of military assistance.</p>
			<h3>Defensive Measures</h3>
			<p>The rational security planner will address the problem posed by 11 September in a sequence of priorities for action. The highest priority must go to measures that reduce the risk of immediate further attacks. In this case defensive measures take priority over offensive. The very much stricter security control at airports is important, even if the measures may appear to be over zealous. They can be fine tuned later. There may be further terrorists ready to repeat the actions of their compatriots on new targets within the US or in Europe or Asia. The security planners need to think the unthinkable. We have a threat in which the perpetrators measure success by the numbers killed and the extent of the chaos wrought on society.. <br>
				<br>
				We also need to consider other potential targets which have a large scale effect &#150; we can be sure the terrorist has already done so. Nuclear power stations and storage areas are among these. Prohibited airspace around such installations needs to be reviewed and probably extended. The military needs to provide ground and air defences for those larger zones. These defensive measures will need to look not just at a repeat of attack by civil airliner, but also at unconventional attack by land and water. Never expect the techniques of the past to be those of the future. The protective measures needed will be manpower intensive, and unsustainable in the longer term. They will however buy time while the in-place terrorists are found. This is a job for the police and intelligence services of the many countries under threat. The first place to go on the offensive is not in far distant lands, but at home, where the danger is most acute.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				The lesson of years of fighting terrorism is that it cannot be solved by conventional warfighting means. There may be some immediate military actions needed to counter an urgent threat. Persuasion of states which support terrorists can be helped by the application of economic, diplomatic and sometimes military force. However in a failed state, the notional government may not be able to do anything useful even under the most extreme pressures. The long term strategy must always be to starve the terrorists of support and recruits. This means giving the populations of the region some form of hope for the future. This takes a very long time.<br>
				<br>
				So the military options for the US and its allies are many and various, but few offer much in the way of reducing the immediate threat from fanatical terrorists. There was a strong political need for retaliation, and this would was usefully focused on bin Laden&#146;s training bases. If there are further attacks , this public need will intensify and the military will be used in an offensive role. For the military and police, the defence at home is where there is a need for extra resources. The balance between defensive and offensive military measures needs to be considered very carefully if we are to be more rather than less secure. </p>
