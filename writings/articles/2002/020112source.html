			<h3>American Defence Plans take shape</h3>
			<p>by Sir Timothy Garden</p>

			<p>The great debate over the US Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) was somewhat overtaken by the events of 11 September 2001. The US Defence Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, had made it clear on taking office that he intended a major shake up in defence priorities. His support for missile defence, space based systems, and the use of new technologies was well known. However the institutional pressures within the Department of Defense were causing a considerable rift to develop between Rumsfeld's  civilian staff and the military chiefs by the Summer of 2001. His view of  future military requirements had profound implications for the traditional division of resources between the army, navy, air force and marines. An American force posture that depended on long range air power, space based systems and new technologies was unlikely to require as many troops. Nor was the expected extra money for defence coming on stream as rapidly as the defence establishment had anticipated. The new Bush administration provided a small addition to the budget for a number of measures designed to improve retention of personnel, despite the General Audit Office having acknowledged a shortfall of some $50 billion a year in the defence budget to cover current activities. In the past 60 years, the US has averaged a spend of 8% of GDP on defence: in 2001, the figure is 2.9%.<br>
				<br>
				The QDR report was published at the end of September, which allowed it to nod at the changed security context  after the attacks on New York and Washington two weeks earlier. However, the major part of the staff work was completed well before then. This difficulty was overcome by explaining that the approach taken was now to be &quot;capabilities-based&quot; rather than the traditional &quot;threat-based&quot;. This capabilities-based model focuses more on how an adversary might fight rather than specifically whom the adversary might be or where a war might occur. Having said that, it remains difficult to quantify what is needed without some thought as to the nature of possible future threats. Nevertheless, the review  manages to avoid mentioning China at all, and refers only to Russia in the context of future stability in Europe.<br>
				<br>
				The starting point for addressing the new strategic context is a recognition of how bad the current state of US forces has become. The QDR identifies problems with readiness, retention of people, poor training facilities, sustained underfunding of infrastructure maintenance, and a lack of investment in new equipment, which is described as living off the fat of the 80's. These problems will be well known in the UK and other European defence establishments. <br>
				<br>
				The new US strategic framework is to be built around four policy aims: assuring allies and friends; dissuading future military competition; deterring threats and coercion against U.S. interests; and, if deterrence fails, decisively defeating any adversary. In order to shape the forces necessary, the QDR spells out four tasks. These are first and primarily to defend the United States. Second, to deter aggression and coercion forward in critical regions. To carry this out they see the need to maintain regionally tailored forces stationed and deployed in Europe, Northeast Asia, the East<br>
				Asian littoral, and the Middle East/Southwest Asia. Indeed the report makes it clear that forward deployments will continue to be important, and will need to be flexible enough for changing circumstances. While many expected a retreat of US military capability back home, the QDR indicates increasing presence around the world. The third task is  &quot;swiftly defeat aggression in overlapping major conflicts while preserving for the President the option to call for a decisive<br>
				victory in one of those conflicts - including the possibility of regime change or occupation&quot;. This rather complex task will give the defence planners plenty of opportunity to bid up their requirements. The final task is to be able to conduct a limited number of smaller-scale contingency<br>
				operations. Whether this includes peacekeeping is not clear. Certainly the United Nations does not get a single mention in the QDR.<br>
				 <br>
				The QDR does not detail the force structures that will be developed in any but the most general terms. Countering CBRNE threats is a recurring theme. For those unfamiliar with this new fashionable acronym it stands for chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and enhanced high explosive weapons. Developments in space capabilities including control of space aspects are trailed. Intelligence is seen as a key enabler.  To the European reader, the vision of global reach supported by extraordinary technologies and massive firepower makes the practicality  of future alliance operations seem unlikely. While the QDR constantly refers to helping allies and friends, it gives no clue as to how the widening gap in capabilities between the US and the rest of the world will be bridged. But these plans may take far longer to come into being than anyone predicts. On 10 January. President Bush signed the Defense funding bill for 2002. It was for $318 bn, which was a rise of $30 bn over the previous year. Just over half of that increase goes on missile defence and personnel retention, which leaves nothing like enough to cover the shortfalls that were identified a year before. As public finance becomes ever more difficult in the USA, we may find that the timescales for these grandiose plans begins to lengthen.<br>
