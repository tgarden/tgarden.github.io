			<h3>Depleted Uranium Hits the Fan</h3>

			<p>Somewhat surprisingly, the possible hazards of the residue of depleted uranium (DU) ammunition in the Balkans has taken over the headlines in the press and broadcast media. DU  shells are used to in anti-tank weapons systems to penetrate modern armour. They are more effective because of the very high density of the metal. The Uranium metal is called depleted because its highly radioactive isotope has been removed. Nevertheless, there is some radiation hazard at very short distances, especially if any of the material is ingested. Protective measures for examining contaminated sites are relatively simple, and are similar to those used for hazardous chemical spills, or working in asbestos environments. The identification and marking of potentially hazardous sites is an important part of this, and is something which should be done throughout the war zones in the Balkans.</p>
			<p>However the current alarm stems from fears that some of the NATO forces, who were in Kosovo, are now suffering severe adverse medical effects from exposure to DU. The medical evidence appears inconclusive, which is scarcely surprising. Indeed the reluctance of the UK MOD to carry out a full scale study will probably stem from the knowledge that such a study is unlikely to be any more conclusive. We have seen the difficulties in trying to show causal relations for cancers with overhead power lines, proximity to nuclear power stations and most recently with mobile phones. In each case. the sample size was larger than the Kosovo ground forces, and the exposure to potential hazard better documented. </p>
			<p>Nevertheless, the MOD moved quickly yesterday with an early announcement of a voluntary screening programme for troops. The greater degree of reaction, particularly in Italy and Germany, had the potential for unfortunate comparisons to be drawn about how the UK looked after its troops. It looks as though it was intervention by Downing Street which brought forward the announcement. We can hope that this limited response will be enough to keep the confidence of the troops concerned. There remains however an undercurrent of concern about the handling of the various medical effects that some suffered after the Gulf War. This coupled with the desperate shortages throughout the military medical services does not help morale.</p>
			<p>	One other significant aspect has been the way that this story has been characterised as a split within NATO: another division between the US and Europe. We may be in for more such events as the year continues.</p>
