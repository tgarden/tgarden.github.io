			<h4><font size="-2" color="#0b0b0b">British Attitudes </font></h4>
			<p><font size="-2" color="#0b0b0b">I should make it clear that I speak to you as very much a minority British opinion - I believe that we have missed out on our opportunities in Europe for the last 50 years and we are in danger of repeating our mistakes yet again. However, the average British citizen starts with a suspicion of everything to do with the EU.  Part of this is cultural: there is a worry that the highly centralised government we know in London, will move to a parallel authoritarian control through a remote bureaucracy in Brussels, who cannot take into account local needs. Part of it is mild xenophobia, which may come from our geography as an offshore island somewhat isolated from the rest of Europe. Until the opening of the Channel Tunnel in 1994, the only way to the rest of Europe was by boat or by air. It may also be our attachment to what was once a vast empire that looked well beyond Europe, and remains linked today through the Commonwealth. That also gave us a status as a world leader, and the adjustment to second ranking power status has been difficult for a nation that has not lost a war in living memory. Our very close relationship to the United States also colours our thinking, and is a recurring dilemma in our relations with Europe. The two world wars of the 20th Century have also had a profound affect on British thinking. Undefeated, and fighting Germany as the main enemy on both occasions, this has left a mistrust particularly in older generations, which affects the politics of deeper European integration.<br>
					<br>
					So let me briefly explain how Britain has approached the developments that have led to the EU over the years since the Second World War, and then spend a little more time on the issues that face us today. </font></p>
			<h4><font size="-2" color="#0b0b0b">EEC starts without Britain </font></h4>
			<p><font size="-2" color="#0b0b0b">In many ways all that we see today in the European Union is derived from the mechanism that was used to manage the economic aid to Europe under the Marshall Plan. The Committee for European Economic Cooperation in 1947, and its aid agency the  Organisation for European Economic Cooperation, were actively supported by the US as a way to move towards European unification as a way to prevent yet another war between the European states.  There was considerable support in those early days in Europe for giving up some national sovereignty  for the greater good of the region. Yet when it came to detailed proposals, there was always a number  of national objections, usually from the British or French. In 1951 one part of Western Europe - France, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg and West Germany formed a much closer economic alliance in the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). This was a significant split, where the British and Scandinavians  did not take part. The effects of that division are still with us to an extent today. The Six pushed on with other aspects of integration and the Rome Treaty was signed in 1957 and ratified in 1958 bringing into being a common market and an atomic energy community - the European Economic Community (EEC) and Euratom. </font></p>
			<h4><font size="-2" color="#0b0b0b">EFTA </font></h4>
			<p><font size="-2" color="#0b0b0b">While we now know that the Six and the Rome Treaty were to be the winners in economic integration in Europe, another Six European nations had pursued the route to a free trade area only. These were Britain, Norway, Denmark, Sweden Austria and Switzerland. The UK had a particular problem with the large number of preferential arrangements it had with the Commonwealth. Accepting the rules of the EEC would mean a steep rise in UK food prices and would be damaging to the economies of its colonies and former colonies. EFTA was formed in 1960 and eventually rose to ten members with the addition of Portugal, Finland, Iceland and Liechtenstein.  The rules of EFTA suited its members very well since they were free to deal externally how they wished, and the basis of the internal free market was industrial with hardly any agricultural trade included. This meant that they could continue their own agricultural systems unlike the members of the EEC who were under remit to harmonise arrangements under the common agricultural policy. <br>
					<br>
					Yet it was clear that the long term economic interests of the EFTA members would be in their trade with the heavyweights of the EEC. In a slightly extraordinary change of policy, the British Government began exploring the prospects for membership of the EEC in 1960 just as EFTA came into being. It was however 1973 before the UK, Denmark and Ireland were accepted by the founding Six in the EEC. France had been particularly difficult during de Gaulle&#146;s time. By this time the Six were embarked on the next phase of the integration process with a European Union as the goal. </font></p>
			<h4><font size="-2" color="#0b0b0b">Britain Joins the Common Market </font></h4>
			<p><font size="-2" color="#0b0b0b">The heads of state of the Six held a summit at the Hague in 1969 to review the progress towards a common market, that should have been complete by then. They decided, despite the need to fill the gaps that emerged, that they need to push on to a new vision for Europe. They proposed that the EEC should work towards becoming an Economic and Monetary Union. This led to a bigger drive toward economic integration although the vision of that time was not to be realised. It was redefined in Paris in 1972  as the establishment of a European Union by 1980. The exact definition of such a Union was left rather ill-defined. <br>
					<br>
					Negotiations were in full flood for the three new members who were to join in the following year. The UK, as ever, was the most difficult to accommodate. A transition period of 5 years was agreed for UK to harmonise its external tariffs, and to remove the barriers to free trade within the Community. This was a difficult period for its relations with some of its Commonwealth members.  Another difficult aspect centred around the Community budget. This budget extended beyond just running the administration of the EEC.  The Common Agricultural Policy was expensive to maintain with its buying up of surpluses across the region. Nor was the UK content with the Community&#146;s fisheries policy. Despite all this the UK, Ireland, Denmark and Norway concluded their negotiations successfully in  1973. Unfortunately, Norway was unable to sell the economic benefits to its electorate who declined the opportunity in a referendum.  This is an important reminder of the difficult domestic politics which attach to much of the European integration developments. Not only do governments have to be convinced of the long term benefits of giving up sovereignty, they have also to convince their populations. Agreement cannot be taken for granted. <br>
					<br>
					One of the interesting effects of these three additional members joining was to have a key effect on the language of the EEC. The Heath government as part of their deal to get French agreement to the UK application, had agreed that they would accept French as the language to be used by officials. However the Irish and Danes refused to use anything but English, and over the years English has become the first draft language of the community.</font></p>
			<h4><font size="-2" color="#0b0b0b">Margaret Thatcher and Europe </font></h4>
			<p><font size="-2" color="#0b0b0b">Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister in 1979. She is often characterised as anti-European, and indeed her position today in retirement seems to be that Britain should come out of the EU. However she was in power when Britain signed up to the moves towards a Union through the Single European Act. She was in power for a long time, and was not too worried about European sensitivities. She believed that the UK was paying too much in contributions compared to better off nations in the rest of the community. When she came to power the UK contribution was at about &pound;1Bn and was set to increase considerably. her attitude to what she saw as unfairness - &#147;British taxpayer&#146;s money going to German farmers&#148; - soured relationships. She achieved a rebate, but at a considerable price in Britain&#146;s relationships with the rest of Europe. </font></p>
			<h4><font size="-2" color="#0b0b0b">The Single European Act </font></h4>
			<p><font size="-2" color="#0b0b0b">The  European Parliament  picked up this concept of a Union. Most important was the decision of the first directly-elected European Parliament of 1979 to take up the European Union issue again to produce a draft European Union treaty. The Parliament's European Union treaty would have brought both economic and foreign policy matters within the range of the Union's decision making machinery. They hoped for greater power so that they could make decisions on behalf of the nations . As before the individual governments, particularly Britain, were reluctant to see their national power moving away to Brussels. <br>
					<br>
					The Single European Act  of 1987 did not go as far as the Parliament had wished . However it contained a number of important commitments to carry integration forward. The European Council was recognised as the supreme body. There were major changes to the Rome Treaty. Majority voting was to be allowed in the Council of Ministers in respect of the completion of the single market. The internal market was to be completed by the end of 1992. This would be a market without internal frontiers. <br>
					<br>
					The European Monetary System, in which the states attempted to keep their exchange rates moving around a narrow band, had been launched in 1979. The UK had not joined the system at that time. The Single European Act moved the convergence of economic and monetary policy further forward. It looked to members taking account of experience in the E M S with a view to the development of the European currency Unit. </font></p>
			<h4><font size="-2" color="#0b0b0b">The Maastricht Treaty </font></h4>
			<p><font size="-2" color="#0b0b0b">As soon as the Single European Act was ratified, work began on the move towards Monetary Union. The Delors report of 1980 recommended a three-stage approach to monetary union which would end with a single currency. The first stage required members to participate in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary system. As I said, the UK had not been a participant  when the EMS had been launched. The exchange rate mechanism required participants to keep their currency exchange rates closely in step. Unfortunately, the UK eventually chose to join  at a time in 1990 when it was suffering higher rates of inflation than other European members. When speculators took advantage of this weakness, it was forced out of the mechanism and British public opinion hardened against greater economic integration with Europe . <br>
					<br>
					Other great changes were happening in Europe at this time. The end of the Cold War meant that German reunification was now on the agenda. In addition the central and Eastern European nations were prospective members of the Union in the longer term. The European Council (the leaders of all 12 EU members) met in Maastricht in December 1991 to hammer out the agreement for a treaty on a European Union. The reunification of Germany made the political pressure for integration greater on the continent. This brought into focus the differing schools of thought on the future of Europe. Some, and at that time it would be the strong French/German axis) had a vision of political union that would be aiming towards some federation. The UK was of a different view. As Margaret Thatcher made it clear that she saw this as an arrangement for co-operation between independent sovereign states. <br>
					<br>
					The negotiations to bring the EU into being were complex and reflect the different priorities of the states. The road to monetary union was seen by the UK and Denmark as leading to the federal vision, and they secured an opt-out. There was a wish among some to give the European Parliament more powers, because Europe was seen as having a democratic deficit. France needed convincing that it would have compensating influence in the European Council. The proposal for a Social Charter was another sticking point for the UK, although it was argued that fair competition within the EU required states to work to the same rules for workers. It was Maastricht which also brought in the formal recognition that Europe should have a Common Foreign and Security Policy. <br>
					<br>
					Maastricht was ratified in 1993 and is the basis of the current European Union. It gave three roles (or pillars as they are usually known) to the EU. The first is the economic, social and cultural competences. The widening of the Rome Treaty provisions transformed the EEC to the EC. The aim was to move onwards from a common market to an economic and monetary union. The second pillar is that of foreign and security policy, and the third is Justice and Home affairs. </font></p>
			<h4><font size="-2" color="#0b0b0b">British Politics of Europe Today </font></h4>
			<p><font size="-2" color="#0b0b0b">Through the last decade, the Conservative Party, which originally took the UK into Europe under the Heath Government of the mid 70s, has moved significantly towards an anti European stance. Much of this was caused by the major political disaster of Britain being forced out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism by currency speculation. Britain had joined the ERM late, and at what proved to be an unsustainable exchange rate. As the British economy went into recession in 1992, the chancellor Norman Lamont needed to lower interest rates. He couldn&#146;t as he had to maintain the value of Stirling against the other European currencies. Indeed he had to raise the rates to preserve the attraction of Stirling, which put the country into deeper recession, and so the vicious circle would continue. Lamont pledged to keep Stirling at its ERM required rate and said that he would do whatever was necessary. As the money markets saw an opportunity for great profit, he raised interest rates until they reached 15% and spent $10 bn trying to defend the exchange rate. It failed on 17 September 1992, and Britain came out of the ERM. It was a political disaster for John Major&#146;s Conservative Government, and one that was a watershed for the Conservative view of Europe. It also had a profound effect on the British public who saw this as a national humiliation for which Europe was responsible. <br>
					<br>
					When the Conservative Party leadership battle took place after their defeat in 1997, it was to an extent a battle between the old guard pro-Europeans and the younger Eurosceptic section of the party. the Eurosceptics won, and have been pushing the Conservative party to adopt an ever more anti-European agenda. There are  a small section who talk about coming out of Europe and even looking towards NAFTA. <br>
					<br>
					The Labour Party returned to power in 1997 after 19 years in the wilderness. Some elements  had been suspicious of Europe in the past, and there remains a section of the party who are less than enthusiastic. However the new leadership was very pro-European. Tony Blair spoke good French, and was at ease throughout Europe. His key supporter, Peter Mandelson, was an ardent pro-European. Once in office they made it clear that they would move quickly to place Britain at the heart of Europe. In the July, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, said that the time was now very short to join the Euro with the first wave, but it was just possible. Britain reversed its opt out from the Social Charter, which had been so hard fought for by the previous administrations. It did not however reverse the opt out from the Schengen Agreement which removed internal immigration checks and all internal border controls. The island nation approach still operates. <br>
					<br>
					However, despite the extraordinary large majority that they had won in the election, they seemed to suffer a crisis of confidence in the August after the election. The threat of massive anti-European coverage in the main newspapers made them delay the move towards the Euro. The &#147;5 conditions&#148; were invented, and the current policy is that a decision on whether to hold a referendum will be made within the first 2 years of the next parliament. The chance was again missed, as the inner core of Europe goes forward with economic and monetary integration. <br>
					<br>
					Having lost the possibility of leadership in this field, Tony Blair turned to another: that of European Defence. Perhaps surprisingly, in one aspect of EU development, the United Kingdom could be seen by its European partners as the leading innovator and driving force. The work that followed on European Defence Policy (EDP) is widely credited to the UK change in attitude. No one believes that the enthusiastic adoption of EU defence goals at Helsinki in 1999 would have been possible without the key work by the British government over the preceding year. In the immediate aftermath of the 1997 UK General Election, the new Labour government gave every impression that it would continue the transatlantic focus to defence policy that had been pursued so assiduously by all its post-war predecessors. The Strategic Defence Review (SDR) took this as its foreign policy assumption, and had little to say about Europe. The promotion of the Western European Union (WEU) as a safety valve for any schemes for wider European military ambitions was retained as a policy aim. Yet no sooner was the SDR published than a new approach to European defence was formulated in the inner circles of government. The increasing enthusiasm for producing a better EU defence posture can be tracked through a series of summit meetings. In October 1998 at P&ouml;rtschach, Tony Blair indicated that the UK would be prepared to consider military co-operation within the EU. The December 1998 Franco-British summit at St Malo provided the real breakthrough with proposals for improved EU defence capabilities, and the requirement for Europe to have &quot;the capacity for autonomous action&quot;. This resulted in the new proposals for European force capabilities that were agreed in Helsinki in December 1999. <br>
					<br>
					But the initial UK enthusiasm has now waned for a number of reasons. One cause is undoubtedly a frustration that nothing in new European capabilities has resulted. Events in the security field have also brought into stark relief the very different relationship that the UK has with the US. While NATO declared Article V on the day after the 9/11 attacks, the US cherry-picked the nations that it wanted to operate with in Afghanistan. The UK was there in the air and on the ground for both warfighting and peacekeeping. The divisions in the run up to Iraq are fresh in everyone's mind. Tony Blair was a passionate supporter of the Bush agenda, and sided with the US against France and Germany. Now after Iraq, the UK is reshaping its defence policy and it is clear that it is looking to how it will operate with the US for serious future military actions. <br>
					Relationships between the EU and the US are not good at present across a whole range of issues: security, trade, environment, and international law. This makes for difficult choices for the UK government that wishes to be seen as a bridge between Europe and the US. It seems however that when the chips are down in the security arena, if not in the other areas, the UK opts for its US ally.</font></p>
			<h4><font size="-2" color="#0b0b0b">The Future </font></h4>
			<p><font size="-2" color="#0b0b0b">It looks as though the future of Britain&#146;s relationships with Europe is set to remain much as the past. We are the reluctant partners, to an extent perhaps increasingly resented by the rest of the members. We eventually adopt everything that we have earlier rejected, but fail to tell our population of the great benefits that have accrued. We may be in greater economic difficulty when our inward investors come to believe that we will endlessly defer joining the Euro. There will be a damaging national debate not just over this, but also over a referendum on the new EU constitution. The anti-Europeans will use it as an occasion to frighten voters about deeper integration and rule from Brussels. We are gaining constitutional rights that we never had through our EU citizenship, we are able to benefit from an expanding rich market. Somehow we manage to keep the special arrangements that we have with the US, but they decline in importance. Our future is in Europe, and I hope that, as in the past, we shall manage to convince the people to swallow their prejudices and vote for greater prosperity, security and influence. <br>
