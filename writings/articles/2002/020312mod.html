			<h3>The Strategic Defence Review: A New Chapter</h3>
			<p>A Commentary on the Public Discussion Paper</p>
			<address>by Professor Sir Timothy Garden and Professor the Lord Roper</address>
		</div>
		<div align="left">
			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>The public discussion paper raises some very large issues which extend to questions about the UK's future foreign policy as well as its approach to defence policy. Many of the questions raised can only be answered in broad generalisations. The development of defence policy, and the forces and structures to underpin that policy, cannot be an objective or certain process. For a fuller answer, risks must be quantified, and judgements about acceptable risk made. The timescales for changing defence posture are long, and our ability to forecast future international and domestic circumstances is imperfect. <br>
				<br>
				The Strategic Defence Review of 1998 was widely regarded as a sound effort to balance all these uncertainties and provide a planning basis for UK defence capability at an affordable cost. Since its publication, events have in general reinforced the assumptions made in the SDR. There have however been four new considerations, which were not known in 1998. These are: the  proposed development of EU military structures; the experience of the  Kosovo campaign; the long term personnel problems in the UK military, and the new threat of 11 September terrorism.<br>
				<br>
				Security involves more than defence policy and the armed forces as was recognised by the SDR. Yet no parallel review across the other elements of UK government, which contribute to national and international security, has been carried out. The development of a conflict prevention budget is a laudable exception to this.</p>
			<h3>The Problem</h3>
			<p>The terrible events of 11 September 2001, and the new type of campaign in Afghanistan which followed, certainly demand urgent attention. They raise issues in addition to the security requirements explored in the SDR. While the promotion of international peace and stability by the use of defence diplomacy, peace support operations and expeditionary warfare capability may have an effect on the causes of some terrorism in the longer term, it may have little or no impact on the threat from al-Qaeda or similar fanatical terrorist networks. <br>
				<br>
				The prime responsibility of any government is the safety of its citizens. In determining an appropriate strategy, actions and resources should be allocated with this requirement in mind. The current expeditionary strategy may not prove to be an effective counter to the new threat. In breaking down the problem, the timescales for both threats and solutions need to be carefully considered. While long term promotion of the rule of law, economic growth and democracy may reduce the causes of dissent and perhaps terrorism in a particular region, the strategy takes decades to succeed. At the other end of the spectrum, the capturing or killing of individual terrorists can stop an immediate terror attack, but may in turn spawn many more in the medium term. The choice of how to allocate existing and new resources both nationally and internationally needs to address both immediate threats and long term consequences. <br>
				<br>
				To deal with these difficult analytical problems, we have approached the problem by first considering what actions are required now, and then which can be developed over the coming years.</p>
			<h3>The Immediate Requirement</h3>
			<p>The UK is involved in a range of security activities around the world. Given the costs and limitations of the armed forces today, all of these contributions have been carefully assessed. It is therefore important that new problems are not created unnecessarily by premature withdrawal from current commitments.<br>
				<br>
				However, there is an immediate possible threat to the lives of UK citizens and to the economy from international terrorism. The attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were years in the planning. A large number of adherents to an anti-Western fanatical terrorist network appear to have passed through a variety of training establishments before being dispersed globally. The UK is an obvious target, because of its policies, its wealth and its high concentration of people. Since the threat is here now, and the consequences of failure to defend could be severe, this is the most urgent focus for security efforts.<br>
				<br>
				It is a commonplace to observe that counter-terrorism at home is not primarily a military activity. The police and intelligence services traditionally take the lead, with the military providing assistance as necessary. This assumption should be re-examined, as the new circumstances may require a new approach. Counter-terrorism requires complex co-ordination of many agencies at national and local level. The recent experience of the Foot &amp; Mouth epidemic, the flood relief and other civil problems, suggest that military leadership may be able to achieve a coherent response more effectively in times of acute difficulty. Certainly for possible terrorist events using biological, chemical or radiological agents, the military has a more practised approach than other civilian agencies.<br>
				<br>
				The priorities at home can be divided into first preventing successful terrorist attacks, and secondly coping with the disaster if one were to take place (what has become known as consequence management). All available military resources should be considered for what they can do in relation to these two tasks. UK based training units and the Reserves are obvious candidates for a greater role. One particular area of weakness is in the military medical capability which would be needed to assist the NHS in any major attacks. <br>
				<br>
				While there are many ways to improve defensive and consequence management arrangements in the UK, the MOD should consider all or some of the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The MOD becomes the lead department for Home Security.
				<li>A military organisation is established with responsibility for Home Security
				<li>The Reserves' tasking is reviewed to make Home Security their first priority.
				<li> Resources for Home Security including consequence management are given first priority over other defence programmes.
			</ul>
			<ol>
				
			</ol>
			<h3>The Longer Term Requirement</h3>
			<p>The majority of issues addressed in the discussion paper focus on how international terrorism is addressed in the longer term. The roles for which the UK is currently providing armed forces are entirely worthwhile, and will help promote long term stability and peace around the world. They may make the circumstances for reduction of terrorism somewhat easier in the longer term, but just like countering international crime there is no certainty about success. The problem of the international terrorist is a global one. The approaches must also be global. Control of transfer of money, technology, weapons and terrorist expertise are as important as any overseas military operations in this field. <br>
				<br>
				It is difficult to see in general how a greater deployment of UK military forces overseas can make much difference to the nature of the long term international terrorist threat. The elimination of secret bank accounts may be more useful than a squadron of Special Forces. This is not to suggest that British Forces have no role overseas. The requirements covered by the SDR remain relevant and important. They may also at the margin reduce the circumstances which give rise to the next generation of terrorism. Perhaps an even greater contribution can be made through the Defence Diplomacy activities which British forces undertake so successfully. <br>
				<br>
				British forces will need to be able to come to the assistance of allies who are attacked by international terrorists. Despite the difficulty of deterring fanatical attackers, a military response will remain appropriate in many cases. The Afghanistan campaign was conducted is a considered and proportionate way as a response to the attacks of 11 September. The military response coupled with diplomatic and intelligence action was essential. If the UK is to be able to play a full part in these sorts of operations, it needs to maintain a modern broad military capability. Although tailored military coalitions are the most likely future force arrangements, NATO remains essential to make these possible through common doctrine, training and interoperable equipment. The UN has a continuing role in giving the legal framework for these operations, and for building the international support which helps all aspects of the counter terrorist campaign.<br>
				<br>
				The EU has shown that it has much to contribute in the Justice and Home Affairs area of preventing terrorism. It needs now to be encouraged to focus on the harder security issues. While the UK has done much to start the process, the project has in recent months slipped back. The UK on its own cannot do everything, nor can it expect to leave the problem to the United States. Extra resources will be needed for UK defence to meet the needs of the SDR, and the additional needs of homeland measures in the light of 11 September. Similar problems beset all our European allies. Yet we continue to waste defence resources by pointless duplication of hundreds of military support activities between EU members. Key enabling capabilities could be funded if we rationalised aggressively throughout the EU. This will take a long time to achieve, but will require strong policy pressure if it is to begin.</p>
			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>The new threat to the security of the UK is serious, yet it seems to receive a low political profile. If a large scale terrorist attack with mass casualties should succeed on UK territory in the coming years, the Government will rightly be held to account for what measures it took in the  light of 11 September 2001. There may be much going on behind the scenes, but the public has little awareness. Certainly the funding priorities of the Government do not appear to have shown any great change as a result. <br>
				<br>
				There are many ways to address the problem, but there is no certainty that such attacks can ultimately be prevented. Protecting the most critical facilities is important, and being able to manage the consequences of any attack is vital. The military could take a much higher profile role in homeland security, but this must be considered against the public alarm such moves might cause. Our contributions to international stability remain important tasks, but should not be confused with the prevention of international terrorism.</p>
			<h3> Annex: Answers to Specific Questions</h3>
			<address>1. What should the international community do to address the key underlying causes of international terrorism? What specifically should the UK aim to do?</address>
			<address>
			</address>
			<p>The current complex range of international approaches to the promotion of the rule of law, economic development, human rights, education and good governance remain the right approach. They will reduce the causes of some terrorism which arises from local repression or injustice, but will not address the problems of fanatic terrorism. Here international co-operation on intelligence and financial transfers are more important. Research into the causes of the new form of terrorism is particularly needed. The UK should continue to act as a leader of international opinion. It should also accelerate its approach to the .7% of GDP target for overseas aid.</p>
			<address>2. In the medium to long term, what balance should the UK seek to strike between contributing Armed Forces, on the one hand, to help address the symptoms of terrorism and, on the other, to assist in efforts to address the causes of terrorism?</address>
			<p>The armed forces should continue with their SDR tasks which may help address the causes of some terrorism. It is unlikely to be an effective strategy to change spending priorities to provide a notional capability to address the symptoms in the way described in the discussion paper. The opportunities for the application of such an approach are likely to be very limited, and as Afghanistan showed we are already able to make a useful contribution when such occasions arise.</p>
			<address>3. How should we strike a balance between the defence role in helping to protect the UK, and contributing to operations against international terrorists and other asymmetric threats overseas?</address>
			<p>The defence of the UK is the prime responsibility of Government and must take absolute priority. Just as in the Cold War other international tasks were undertaken using capacity provided for UK defence, so we need to readjust our concepts to place the security of the UK at the centre of our thinking.</p>
			<address>4. Are there ways in which military support to the civil authorities could be improved?</address>
			<p>Yes. In particular the committee-led approach to civil emergency planning is inadequate to meet the new threat. The military need to be given a task, and organisation, for home security. Resources across departments need to be allocated so that both prevention and consequence management are improved. It may be that a military lead would be the most effective approach if the public could be reassured. Otherwise, giving lead responsibility to a single point of focus in another government department should be considered.</p>
			<address>5. Are there additional or enhanced roles for our Reserve Forces (both in home defence and security and in  overseas operations)?</address>
			<p>The role and composition of the Reserves needs to be reviewed urgently. Their prime task should be home security, and they should be shaped and equipped for this role. This will include key point guarding (air, land and sea), and consequence management following major terrorist attack. The use of individual Reserves as fill in personnel for regular forces, with the exception of small highly specialist capabilities, should be phased out in recognition of the difficulty of  managing the current high rate of deployment. They should be replaced as necessary by Regulars.</p>
			<address>6. Do we need to make adjustments to our forces, to give more weight to the threat of international terrorism and other asymmetric threats? Do the new challenges mean we should be placing less weight on other military tasks identified in the 1998 Strategic Defence Review?</address>
			<p>There will be additional requirements as a result of the threat of international terrorism and other asymmetric threats. These will require extra expenditure on personnel and equipment. The 1998 SDR remains broadly valid, and there is absolutely no case for placing less weight on its requirements. It is clear that it is already suffering from underinvestment and will need additional resources to make it work. The unwelcome message is that both our original commitments and the new tasks need more resources and this will cost money. The amount of extra resources required could be limited if greater integration on a European basis were politically acceptable.</p>
			<address>7. Are the 5 conceptual aims (prevent, deter, coerce, disrupt and destroy) the right framework for the military role in countering terrorism abroad?</address>
			<p>Each of the aims may have applicability in particular circumstances. It is impossible to generalise. As a basis for discussion at Staff Colleges, we have no problems with the breakdown. However, it would be unwise to think that they provide a template for longterm success against the new form of terrorism. They are techniques which the military can bring to bear and may have a limited effect on the problem.</p>
			<address>8. Within this framework, what is the right balance between operations to disrupt potential threats, find/strike operations and stabilisation operations? Should the UK continue to plan to participate in these types of operations? </address>
			<p>This is another impossible question to answer precisely. At different times, each may assume different levels of importance. The general range of capabilities seen as necessary in the SDR are likely to provide an ability to contribute to each of these type of operations. As always there is a danger of trying to plan the future on the basis of the last campaign experience (in this case Afghanistan). There is no evidence to support any major shift in priority for overseas operations. The utility of Special Forces has been seen on a number of occasions. They need to be adequately resourced.</p>
			<address>9. Do we need to be able to deploy more of our forces more rapidly to counter terrorism worldwide? Should the UK aim to specialise in particular forms of capability or operation as a contribution to operations with allies or concentrate on particular geographic areas?</address>
			<p>There is no rationale for being able to deploy more troops faster and further on the counter terrorist ticket. The deployment requirements for the EU Helsinki goal capability remain an important driver in this respect and rightly cover a wider canvas than counter terrorism. Capability specialisation remains very difficult, although we have now abandoned space, missile defence, tactical nuclear weapons and fighter defence at sea to the United States. Much better would be to use the NATO AWACs model to provide either NATO or EU expensive key enabler capabilities. Restriction by geographic area would be unwise.</p>
			<address>10. What are the roles of the UN, NATO and the EU in tackling international terrorism?</address>
			<p>The UN role remains unchanged. It can act to remove the long term causes for some terrorism. It can legitimise international action and it can acts as forum to put together necessary co-operative arrangements. The NATO role is largely unchanged. It facilitates military co-operation, and can allow the sharing of expertise. It is unlikely to be a major effective actor in counter-terrorism. The EU could have a growing role with its ability to bring together all the regional actors to reduce the terrorist threat with a range of military and non-military aspects. Pooled counter-terrorist and consequence management forces would reduce the costs of handling the problem greatly. Each member state might for example take on the production of one vaccine stockpile to cope with an attack by BW agents. This stockpile would be available to all member states.</p>
			<address>11. Do we need to devote a greater proportion of our military effort to prevention/co-operation activities or security reform overseas? How? Where?</address>
			<p>The more we do of this type of activity, the better. However there is no limit to how much could be done, and we will always have finite resources. The most important thing is to ensure that we focus our efforts on those areas which give the greatest returns  in terms of promoting stability. The relative priorities need to be analysed taking into account all foreign policy requirements. It is unlikely that the totality of effort can be varied by any significant amount given the current size of the UK armed forces.<br>
