HALF RESULTS</FONT></STRONG><FONT COLOR="#AF0000"><BR>

</FONT></H3>

<P><STRONG>RTZ-CRA's first half 1996 sales volume gains were more
than offset by lower metal prices, adverse exchange rate effects and
US copper smelter production delays.<BR>

</STRONG><BR>

Group profit before tax and exceptional items was $891m (1995:
$1,253m) and <STRONG>adjusted earnings</STRONG> were $552m (1995:
$711m) for the first six months of 1996.<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>Lower quoted metal prices</STRONG> offset other price
improvements, reducing earnings by $194m, while <STRONG>exchange rate
effects </STRONG> accounted for a further $34m.<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>Reduced earnings</STRONG> were reported by Kennecott (down
66%) reflecting not only price reductions but production build up
delays at its new copper smelter. Australian dollar strength affected
local operations while Comalco (down 58%) also suffered lower
aluminium prices and Hamersley Iron (down 19%) lower sales.<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>Higher sales volumes</STRONG> elsewhere raised earnings by
$39m. <STRONG>Production volumes rose</STRONG> : aluminium 3%; copper
17%; gold 18%, iron ore 9%, and titanium dioxide feedstock 16%.<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>Earnings growth</STRONG> areas included industrial minerals,
with Iron &amp; Titanium up 62%, Borax 10%, and Argyle Diamonds 30%,
as well as the expanded Escondida copper mine, up 28%.<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>Major development programme progressing well.</STRONG> Five
projects commissioning in the next 18 months. Global exploration
restructuring and refocusing complete.<BR>

Interim dividends declared</STRONG> at equivalents of 16.5 US cents
(10.60 p; 20.65 Aus cents) per share.<BR>

<HR><STRONG><BR>

Mr Robert Wilson, chief executive of RTZ-CRA, said:</STRONG> <CITE>
"There were notable first half improvements in RTZ-CRA's worldwide
industrial minerals businesses and at the expanded Escondida copper
mine. However, Group results were impacted by lower quoted metal
prices, adverse exchange rate movements, the slow build up to full
production at Kennecott's new copper smelter and labour problems at
our Australian coal operations.<BR>

<BR>

"First-half demand for metals in the large industrial economies has
been mixed. Western world copper consumption was over 3 per cent
higher than in the first half of 1995 but demand for some others was
down on the previous year, including aluminium by almost 7 per cent.
Overall, non-ferrous metal prices declined by 11 per cent compared
with the first half of 1995.<BR>

<BR>

"Our programme of major development projects is progressing well. The
most advanced include: $114 million Greens Creek (US) silver/zinc
(now commissioning); $319 million Pipeline (US) gold (mid 1997); $750
million Boyne Island (Australia) aluminium (mid 1997); $260 million
QIT (Canada) UGS plant (late 1997); and $233 million Fortaleza
(Brazil) nickel (early 1998).<BR>

<BR>

"Exploration results continue to be promising, especially in Canadian
diamonds and Indonesian copper/gold. Greater efficiencies following
the refocusing and restructuring of global exploration are expected
to show savings of $50 million per year from 1997."<BR>

<BR>

</CITE><STRONG>Sir Derek Birkin, RTZ's chairman said:</STRONG> <CITE>
"Market sentiment has had a sharp adverse impact on metal prices in
1996. Confidence was shaken by Sumitomo's announcement in June. The
current price levels of many metals appear to be more depressed than
the fundamentals of supply, demand and stocks would suggest.<BR>

<BR>

"Economic indicators point to a broadly based improvement in the
second half of this year and stronger markets in 1997. On a
longer-term view, we are confident about growth of demand, especially
from the Asian region which now accounts for a significant share of
global consumption of all metals and minerals.<BR>

<BR>

"For RTZ-CRA, with production of our major products still increasing
and with our strong financial position, the longer term holds
considerable promise."</CITE></P>

RESULTS</FONT></EM></STRONG><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#AF0000"><BR>

</FONT></I></B></P>

<P>A decline in average metal prices and unfavourable exchange rates
coincided with reduced iron ore sales from Australia to Japan and
Europe and difficulties at the new US copper smelter. The falling
copper price also resulted in adjustments to the provisional pricing
of sales to smelters on deferred pricing terms.<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>Group sales revenue</STRONG> at $4,003 million was only 6 per
cent lower as generally higher volumes and bulk commodity and
industrial mineral prices partially offset lower quoted metal
prices.<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG>Profit</STRONG> <STRONG>before tax</STRONG> and exceptional
items at $891 million was 29 per cent lower. The tax rate is lower at
30 per cent in 1996 partly reflecting the absence of the effect of
the introduction of a higher corporate tax rate in Australia in the
first half of 1995.<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG><BR>

<BR>

Operating cash flow</STRONG> at $881 million was down by 29 per cent,
the two main reasons being lower prices and the effects of the
smelter delay. Higher capital expenditure at $756 million reflected
the Group's substantial development programme.<BR>

<BR>

<EM>Balance Sheet</EM><BR>

<BR>

Net debt increased to $1.9 billion in the first half of 1996 and as a
percentage of total capital it rose to 18.8 per cent compared with
16.1 per cent at the start of the year. Net interest expense
(including capitalised interest of $29 million) was covered 24 times
by pre-interest profits. Retained profits and the strength of the
Australian dollar increased shareholders' funds by $445 million.<BR>

<BR>

<EM>Dividends</EM><BR>

<BR>

Interim dividends equivalent to 16.5 US cents per share have been
declared by RTZ and CRA, marginally higher than the US dollar
equivalent of the 1995 RTZ interim dividend. As announced in May
1996, the balance between interim and final dividends will follow the
former RTZ practice which historically has meant that approximately
one third of the annual total has been paid at the half year and two
thirds at the full year.<BR>

<BR>

RTZ-CRA's policy aims to increase dividends progressively over time,
without cutting dividends in economic downturns. The US dollar, in
which the majority of sales are made, most reliably records the
Group's global business performance and is now RTZ-CRA's main
reporting currency. It is, therefore, the natural currency in which
to determine dividends. However, CRA dividends will still be declared
and paid in Australian dollars and RTZ dividends declared and paid in
pounds sterling, converted at the exchange rates applicable two days
prior to announcement of dividends.<BR>

<BR>

Interim dividends will be paid of 10.60 pence per ordinary share
(1995: 10.50p) as a Foreign Income Dividend (FID) to RTZ shareholders
and of 20.65 Australian cents per ordinary share (1995: 30 cents) as
a fully franked dividend to CRA shareholders. Dividend payments to
RTZ and CRA ADR holders will be made by the Bank of New York at the
rate of 66.0 US cents per ADR.<BR>

<BR>

The respective dividends will be paid on 21 October 1996 to holders
registered at close of business on 1 October 1996, and to RTZ bearer
shareholders on or after 21 October 1996, against coupon 75. The
ex-dividend date will be 23 September 1996. Dividends to RTZ and CRA
ADR holders will be paid on 22 October.<BR>

<BR>

Dividends of 1.6625 pence per RTZ 'A' preference share and 1.75 pence
per 'B' preference share for the second half of 1996 will be paid to
holders registered on 19 November 1996, on 2 January, 1997, and to
'B' preference bearer shareholders on or after that date against
coupon 69. The ex-dividend date will be 11 November, 1996.<BR>

<H3>Copper Production up 17% to 363,000 tonnes<BR>

</H3>

<P>Reported copper market stocks remain in reasonable balance but the
average copper price in the first half of 1996 fell to 115 per pound
from 132 per pound a year earlier.<BR>

<BR>

RTZ-CRA share of output at Escondida (Chile) was up 84 per cent to
123,300 tonnes as the Phase 3 expansion came on stream. Grasberg's
(Indonesia) production increased by 26 per cent following mine and
mill expansions completed at the end of 1995. Mine production at
Palabora (South Africa) was also up by 6 per cent as a result of
mineralogy and process improvements.<BR>

<BR>

Production at the Bingham Canyon mine (US) fell by 11 per cent as
favourable recovery and throughput only partially offset temporarily
lower ore grades. Neves Corvo (Portugal) production also fell by 10
per cent due to planned mining of lower grade ore.<BR>

<BR>

Overall, RTZ-CRA's refined copper production was reduced by 28 per
cent mainly due to production build-up delays at Kennecott's smelter
in the US.<BR>

</P>

<P><HR></P>

<H3>Gold Production up 18% to 905,000 ounces<BR>

</H3>

<P>The average gold price improved by 3 per cent to $395 per
ounce.<BR>

<BR>

RTZ-CRA gold production was boosted by a 79,000 ounce half year
contribution from the Grasberg mine. Production was higher at most
other Group mines, including Bingham Canyon (up 12 per cent), Kelian
(Indonesia - up 12 per cent), Peak (Australia - up 25 per cent) and
Ridgeway (US - up 16 per cent). Improvements resulted from higher
gold grades and improved throughput.<BR>

<BR>

RTZ-CRA share of first half production was at record levels. The
stronger Australian dollar offset the average 6 per cent increase in
Hamersley Iron's prices for deliveries in 1996/97. Demand was down in
Europe and Japan but firm elsewhere in Asia, with shipments to China
at record levels. The net effect, however, was that overall sales
volumes were down 9 per cent.</P>

<BR>

RTZ-CRA's coal mines in Australia were affected by operational
problems and industrial relations disputes. Sales were consequently
down 16 per cent at Blair Athol and Vickery suffered a significant
loss of customers. Coal &amp; Allied reported a loss in the first
half with Hunter Valley production reduced by 14 per cent following
lower output from the coal preparation plant, which is currently
being upgraded. Total sales volumes for Coal &amp; Allied were down
15 per cent.<BR>

<BR>

In Indonesia, output at Kaltim Prima was higher and sales volumes
increased by 14 per cent. Opportunities to increase market outlets
for Kaltim Prima coal are under investigation with particular focus
on supply to the growing independent power sector in Asia.<BR>

<HR><BR>

<STRONG><EM><CITE>US coal</CITE></EM><CITE> Production up 2% to 20.1m

<BR>

Responding to both new and renewed contracts, output and sales from
RTZ-CRA's US coal operations increased, partially offsetting weak
spot prices. In the Powder River Basin, the decline in prices for
coal from Cordero slowed while prices for coal from Spring Creek and
Antelope stabilised. At Colowyo in Colorado, RTZ-CRA production
increased by 27 per cent to 2.6m tonnes.<BR>

<BR>

Comalco's earnings declined significantly in the first half of 1996
due to unfavourable LME prices, the stronger Australian dollar and
weaker alumina spot prices.<BR>

<BR>

The diversion of resources from pre-development to mining at Weipa,
Australia, resulted in higher bauxite output. The Tiwai Point, New
Zealand, smelter upgrade is commissioning and construction work on
the expansion of the Boyne Island smelter in Australia is ahead of
schedule and expected to begin producing in mid-1997.<BR>

<BR>

In the UK, Anglesey Aluminium's production was at record levels as a
result of improved efficiencies, more cells operating and higher
productivity.<BR>

<BR>

Borate sales revenue was 5 per cent up on the first half of 1995 with
higher overall volumes.<BR>

North American performance was affected by a poor agricultural season
but this was offset by strong sales to the insulation fibreglass
industry. European sales were higher overall than last year with
gains in most applications other than detergents. The Asia Pacific
market showed good volume gains. After several static years, prices
generally improved.<BR>

<STRONG><CITE>Production up 16% to 726,000 tonnes</CITE></STRONG><BR>

<BR>

A general improvement in Iron &amp; Titanium's business was
complemented by significant price increases for two important
co-products. Market tightness for both zircon and rutile resulted in
substantial price increases compared with the first half of 1995.<BR>

<BR>

Richards Bay Minerals in South Africa also gained from an 11 per cent
weakening of the Rand against the US dollar and a reduction in South
African tax rates.<BR>

<BR>

Production at QIT in Canada increased primarily to meet slag
inventory requirements at its Sorel smelter in advance of the
start-up of the upgraded slag (UGS) plant in late 1997.<BR>

minerals</EM></STRONG><BR>

</H3>

<P><STRONG><EM><CITE>Diamonds</CITE></EM></STRONG><BR>

<BR>

First half sales of rough and polished diamonds were well above 1995
levels reflecting higher production (up 12 per cent) and strong
demand for Argyle products which is expected to continue in the
medium term. The existing European sales office in Antwerp, which has
traditionally sold over 20 per cent of Argyle's diamonds, is being
expanded to handle all sales following Argyle's decision not to renew
its contract with the Central Selling Organisation. Most of Argyle's
production will continue to be sold into India where strong customer
relationships already exist.<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG><EM><CITE>Zinc, Lead, Silver</CITE></EM></STRONG><BR>

<BR>

RTZ-CRA's share of zinc production, mainly from mines in Bolivia and
Argentina, increased by 5 per cent to 19,300 tonnes. Total output of
zinc metal was also higher by 5 per cent at 39,100 tonnes. Elsewhere,
lead production was down 15 per cent while silver production rose 8
per cent, the latter reflecting higher mine output at Bingham Canyon
and a higher contribution from Grasberg.<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG><EM><CITE>Salt</CITE></EM></STRONG><BR>

<BR>

Output from Dampier Salt increased by 26 per cent and sales by 9 per
cent. The market firmed towards the end of the first half and two
significant supply agreements were negotiated with Asian
customers.<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG><EM><CITE>Talc</CITE></EM></STRONG><BR>

<BR>

Production of talc was unchanged at 554,000 tonnes. Inventory
reductions in the paper industry reduced demand and bad weather
impacted on paint sales.<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG><EM><CITE>Uranium</CITE></EM></STRONG><BR>

<BR>

Productivity gains, improved throughput and higher grades increased
output from the R&ouml;ssing mine in Namibia by 54 per cent to 942
tonnes of U3O8. Spot prices continued to improve.<BR>

NEW PROJECT DEVELOPMENT UPDATE</EM></STRONG><BR>

</H3>

<P>RTZ-CRA's project development programme is progressing well. New
production is already on stream at Escondida following the completion
in May 1996 of the $560 million Phase 3 expansion. At the Tiwai Point
(New Zealand) aluminium smelter the $325 million upgrade is virtually
complete and, like the $114 million Green's Creek re-development in
the US, is commissioning.<BR>

<BR>

The $750 million expansion of the Boyne Island aluminium smelter in
Australia is expected to start up in mid-1997 with 217,000 tonnes per
year additional capacity.<BR>

<BR>

Construction has begun at the Pipeline gold project in the US, where
production is scheduled to commence in the first half of 1997. The
neighbouring South Pipeline deposit has multi-million ounce potential
and may enter the permitting phase in 1996.<BR>

<BR>

Engineering work is over 90 per cent complete and construction 36 per
cent complete at the $700 million Lihir Gold mine in Papua New Guinea
while the $47 million Morro do Ouro gold mine expansion in Brazil is
one third completed. Construction of the $233 million Fortaleza
nickel mine in Brazil is on schedule for early 1998 start-up.<BR>

<BR>

Site preparation and foundation work is well underway on QIT's $260
million development of the UGS process with its product being
particularly attractive to the growing chloride sector of the pigment
market. Commissioning is expected to commence in the third quarter
1997.<BR>

<BR>

Shaft sinking and underground development began in June on the $440
million underground mine project to extend the life of the Palabora
copper mine.<BR>

<BR>

At Grasberg in Indonesia, a feasibility study is nearing completion
on the expansion of the mine and mill facilities. Initially the
expansion will be undertaken on the basis of the currently permitted
160,000 tonnes per day level. Comprehensive studies have been
undertaken to determine the optimum level of operation above 160,000
tonnes per day. Operations at the higher level, which is currently
expected to be at least 190,000 to 200,000 tonnes per day, will begin
immediately after current studies are completed and government
approvals are received. The project should be completed by mid
1998.<BR>

<BR>

Two further expansion projects are under consideration at Escondida
following the completion of Phase 3. An oxide project to produce
125,000 tonnes per annum of copper cathode is currently in final
feasibility. In addition, various options will be evaluated by the
end of 1997 for a Phase 4 expansion to compensate for future
declining head grades.<BR>

<BR>

All engineering development work on the Century Zinc project in
Australia has ceased while the company negotiates with aboriginal
claimants under the right-to-negotiate procedures of the Native Title
Act.<BR>

<P><STRONG><EM>EXPLORATION UPDATE</EM><BR>

</STRONG></P>

<P>A review of RTZ-CRA's combined exploration has been completed and
the Group is already benefiting from significant re-focusing on the
most prospective targets worldwide. The restructuring has eliminated
overlaps and cut back marginal programmes with reductions spread
evenly across the major regions. Exploration in South America, Asia
and Africa will largely be maintained. Cost savings in the remainder
of 1996 will be offset by one-off re-structuring costs but, from
1997, savings in annual expenditure will be $50 million per year,
when compared with 1995 expenditure.<BR>

<STRONG><EM><BR>

Diamonds</EM></STRONG><BR>

<BR>

Most of the underground bulk sample from A-154 South pipe in the
North West Territories of Canada has been processed with encouraging
results. The sample grade to date is approximately 4.6 carats per
tonne, with the largest gem quality stone weighing 6.02 carats. The
results support earlier indications of an inferred resource of 8.4
million tonnes down to 250 metres. Initial valuation suggests
approximately $260 per tonne of kimberlite and compares favourably
with operating mines around the world.<BR>

<BR>

At the A-418 pipe, 700 metres southwest of A-154 South, mining of a
3,000 tonne bulk sample will be complete by the year end. Earlier in
the year, a grade of 4.02 carats per tonne was indicated. Results
from drilling on A-154 North indicated a grade of 2.19 carats per
tonne.<BR>

<BR>

<STRONG><EM>Copper and Gold</EM></STRONG><BR>

<BR>

Potential for a significant underground orebody adjacent to the
Grasberg mine in Indonesia has been indicated by drilling results
from the Amole Tunnel. Drill holes have returned intersections in
excess of 100 metres with grades in the range of 2 per cent
equivalent copper.<BR>

<BR>

The Las Cruces prospect in Andalucia, southern Spain, continues to
return promising results. The deposit contains a copper resource
grading approximately 6 per cent copper, as well as polymetallic base
and precious metal mineralisation. The total geological resource for
all mineralisation types is in excess of 20 million tonnes at
present. Approximately 140 holes have been drilled on the site to
date and planning for an underground bulk sampling programme has
commenced.<BR>

<BR>

RTZ-CRA has contract of work applications on strategically well-sited
land positions in Kalimantan, Indonesia, where there has been
considerable exploration activity following the neighbouring
discovery of a multi-million ounce gold deposit.<BR>
