			<h3>A Second Gulf War?</h3>
			<p>by Sir Timothy Garden</p>

			<p>As the newspapers fill with reflections about 6 months on from 11 September, a war with Iraq appears to be drawing closer. There still remains no evidence of any link between the terror attacks on the US and the unpleasant regime in Baghdad. We can safely assume that if any evidence existed, then it would have been revealed by now. <br>
				<br>
				The rationale for putting Saddam Hussein high on the US military hit list is the increasing concerns about his development of weapons of mass destruction. This is not a new concern, Saddam used chemical weapons for internal repression as well as in his war with Iraq over a decade ago. After the Gulf War, large chemical weapon stocks were destroyed. He was also investing great efforts in both biological and nuclear weapon development. The scale of the nuclear research  work was astonishing, but again that was dismantled by the UN inspection regime. Although the UN inspectors were hampered in their work, it is generally agreed that they were successful in preventing Iraq from gaining an operational nuclear weapon capability, and they much reduced their other weapon development. <br>
				<br>
				Since the inspectors left four years ago, information has mainly come from defectors and overhead surveillance. The patrolling of the No Fly Zones by US and UK air forces has undoubtedly also kept the Iraqi military focused on their own survival. Sanctions will have hampered technical imports. Nevertheless, these loose constraints will have left some leeway for work to continue on all aspects of the Iraqi weapons' programme. It may be that intelligence assessments are now driving the sense of urgency for doing something about Iraq.<br>
				<br>
				What are the options? We could continue as before. Sometimes the current strategy is to be preferred, if all alternatives are worse. The UN could act to bring pressure to bear through more directed (&quot;smart&quot;) sanctions. It would seek to get the inspectors back in.  Thirdly, a wider air campaign could be used to increase the pressure for getting the inspectors back in. This would be comparable to the Kosovo strategy, where the air campaign was designed to bring Milosevic back to the negotiating table. The fourth option could be an Afghanistan style campaign which sought to use proxy forces on the ground with massive air support to change the regime. Finally, a full scale ground and air war might be undertaken to replace the Iraqi power structure.<br>
				<br>
				All these strategies carry risks, particularly in light of the current highly volatile situation in the region. The UK government does not yet have a clearly articulated policy view. Tony Blair appears to support a US led major military operation. Some in the cabinet would be happier with a war aim that specified the return of the UN inspectors. In the US, there seems little interest in options short of a regime change. Much of the hard talk may be designed to add to the pressure on Saddam, but there is little point in making threats if there is no willingness to carry them out.<br>
				<br>
				How practical are the military options? We have a measure of the scale of military force needed for a campaign against Iraq. In the 1991 Gulf War, a ground force of around 250,000 was assembled to expel the Iraqi invaders from Kuwait. In the event, the prolonged air campaign meant that the ground forces had a relatively easy time, and were able to retake Kuwait in under a week. An attack on Iraq would be a much large war aim. with the need to secure a much greater area. The time taken by the pre-cursor air campaign would give Iraq plenty of opportunity to cause trouble in the region. A ground force at least as large as for the Gulf War would be a wise precaution. However basing for such forces might be more difficult than ten years ago. Saudi Arabia is unlikely to welcome yet more foreign troops.<br>
				<br>
				It has been suggested that the UK might be asked to provide 10% of the ground troops. That would amount to a quarter of the British Army. Already pulled in so many directions, it seems difficult to see how this could be managed without considerable damage to operations in Afghanistan, the Balkans and in Northern Ireland. More reservists are already being called up to fill in the gaps of present commitments.  This could be the final breaking point for British forces, which seem to be needed to be in the lead everywhere.<br>
				<br>
				The military commanders will want to know what the desired end state is to be. How will the Kurds in the north be handled? The Kurds may alarm Turkey  with demands for self governance. Or are we now to have a new form of imperial rule, which will require a continued Allied military presence for years? That will not be an option if we also want to rebuild Afghanistan. NATO, somewhat bruised from its lack of a role in Afghanistan, will find it difficult to achieve consensus for action among its members. Nor will Israel sit on the sidelines as it did in the Gulf War. Sharon might be very pleased to have an external enemy in Iraq to deflect criticism of his internal difficulties.<br>
				<br>
				Maybe the current approach, with increased pressure through the UN sanctions regime will look more attractive as the detailed planning starts. Whatever the approach, it probably means yet more strains on the transatlantic relationship. It will certainly leave Tony Blair in a very politically exposed position both at home and in the EU.</p>
