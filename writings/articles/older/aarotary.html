<ADDRESS><CENTER>Rotary Club, London  10 March 1997

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I seem to spend last year going to a succession of conferences,
workshops and seminars addressing the problems of future European
Security. This could at one level seem rather curious. With the end
of the Cold War and the rapid move towards democratic government and
market economies throughout central and eastern Europe, one ought to
be able say that the prospects for a stable European continent have
never been better. Certainly there is for once no immediate threat of
war across the continent - and that is an unusual state. In the past,
Europe has  been a source of both instability and conflict. So why is
there so much angst, and I detect it among US commentators as well as
Europeans, about future European security? Despite the end of the
years of nuclear confrontation, and the absence of any significant
feeling of military threat in Western Europe, it is clear that we are
approaching a time when decisions are going to be made that will
profoundly affect the future of not just European security, but have
long-term worldwide repercussions.  The two parallel, but distinct,
activities which are coming to a head are the changes in prospect for
NATO and for the European Union. 1997 will see a decision by NATO on
how to enlarge, and also this year the  EU may decide on its approach
both to security and to extended membership. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P> In Western Europe, there is as yet only limited public interest
in the question of NATO enlargement as the focus is on EU issues.
Here, the question which obsesses both opinion formers and publics is
that of monetary union rather than the Common Foreign and Security
Policy or the EU enlargement question. In particular in Britain there
is a vocal group who fear that monetary union will lead inevitably to
a federal Europe with a loss of sovereignty for the UK. This lack of
interest in the more urgent NATO and EU membership agendas is strange
as there is no doubt that the approach that is taken over enlargement
of both, and the European approach to its own security will determine
the future relations between states within Europe and between Europe
and the rest of the World.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In this brief talk, I shall reflect on some of the concerns that
we are hearing around Europe among those who do discuss such matters,
and I shall also raise the question of whether these concerns will
affect the ultimate outcome. I shall start with the question of NATO
enlargement because it looks as though it will be the first decision
to be taken, and perhaps also the first to be implemented. NATO
staffs are hard at work preparing for the Heads of Government meeting
in July in Madrid. We expect that the aim will be to identify the
first tranche of new states to be offered membership, and perhaps a
timescale working towards April 1999 when NATO will celebrate its
50th birthday. All the smart money seems to be on that offer being
confined to Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic and maybe even a
couple more. The assumption is that the mechanism for further
enlargement will also be revealed, and that the worries of Russia
will have been addressed. This is a pretty tall order, and also hides
some other problems, not least of which is where the resources for
enlargement are to come from. Even assuming that these go relatively
smoothly, there is still the requirement for each of the current 16
nation's parliaments to ratify the amendment to the treaty. Here
there are other difficulties.  We can therefore expect to see some
haggling and indeed a muddling of EU issues with the NATO enlargement
process.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The biggest problem of course is the question of how to handle the
countries which are not in that first tranche, and especially Russia.
There is considerable concern that if this part of the process is
mishandled, we could see Europe divided again. There does not seem to
be a consistent view from those in Russia on what arrangement they
might be satisfied with. Nor is the hope in some European capitals
that, since NATO is self evidently not an aggressive organisation,
the Russians will understand that an enlarged NATO is a good thing.
The Ukraine is in an even more difficult position as it cannot decide
whether it wishes to point East or West or stay as an independent
bridge between both.  The latest signs seem to be that the Ukraine
will be able to cope with the first tranche of enlargement and will
be expecting benefits from closer cooperation to the West.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The central European nations that are not included in the first
invitation are likely to include the Baltic States, Romania and
Bulgaria, Slovakia, Albania and the successor states in the former
Yugoslavia. All these need to be brought closely into the European
fold. It may be that a clear commitment and criteria for future
tranches can be coupled with a deepening of PfP to keep them
interested. It will be a difficult diplomatic trick to turn.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>So the choice of approach, the achieving consensus of current
states (and that becomes a greater problem in an enlarged NATO), and
the handling of those left out, especially Russia and the Ukraine,
are some of the problems. There are others: resources for the
enlargement, resources to keep NATO as a real military force, the
role of NATO, internal disputes between members (particularly Greece
and Turkey and the question of Cyprus), the push by some for greater
European command authority and the management of relations with the
EU if a common foreign and security policy becomes more developed.
Time will not allow me to develop the role of the WEU in all this,
except to say that it seems sensible to continue to insist that the
WEU full members must be both members of the EU and of NATO. However,
if that does remain the practice, there will be some difficulties if
EU and NATO enlargement diverge in terms of countries.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Let me turn then to the other side of this security coin. As I
said the European Union in its various stages of development has
acted as a stabilising force. It has of course recently enlarged to
take in the 17 million people of East Germany with German
Unification. The economic burden of this relatively small expansion
has brought home, particularly to Germany, the costs of the process
and the need for clear criteria for new members. To many it has
looked as though the EU is moving deliberately slowly. The cynic
might say that NATO enlargement can be made as a political decision
and the problems solved afterwards, whereas EU enlargement is an
economic decision which will have a direct effect on the wealth of
the current members. The EU has moved with great care towards wider
association agreements with prospective new members. Negotiations
about the fine detail of each market sector have taken a long time
both to hammer out. The first of the non-members to apply back in
1987,  Turkey, still is without any date for prospective membership -
hence its possible use of its NATO veto as a lever. It has taken from
1990 to 1995 for the EU to move to a position where it has started to
give a tentative timetable. The Council hoped that the preliminary
stage of negotiations with the Central and East European countries
would coincide with the start of negotiations with Malta and Cyprus
likely to be in early 1998. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Having decided on its tranche of new members, the EU will then get
down to some hard negotiations. It seems unlikely that any will
become full members before 2001/2002. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>What does all this mean for future European security. We have a
headlong rush towards a limited but important expansion of NATO by
1999, and uncertainties how to handle the remainder of Europe in a
NATO context beyond that. At the same time the EU is progressing more
slowly, and in a more detailed negotiating fashion towards an orderly
enlargement of its economic community. Membership of the EU may not
overtly confer a security guarantee on member nations, but it
certainly provides an implicit guarantee. It is inconceivable that EU
nations would stand aside if one of their number came under external
attack. Into this unclear future, we must also add the uncertain
developments down the road to common foreign and security policy for
Europe, and how it will relate to the WEU and NATO. In addition the
pressures for a move to a single currency may result in a two tier
community within the Union, and this would have very uncertain
results for the future of the EU. Behind both NATO and EU enlargement
there is also the question of costs. As nations run down their
national defence assets, they are showing little sign of being
prepared to pay for the NATO transition costs. Similarly, semi
stagnant European economies in recent years have delayed the
provision of the funds to accelerate the transformation of the
Central and Eastern European economies. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Finally what does this uncertain picture mean for the United
States and its relations with Europe? There is no doubt that
uppermost in the consideration of the current European members of
NATO is the importance of keeping the organisation relevant to
provide the key linkage with the US.   A mature European Union
expanded to 25 or more countries perhaps towards the end of the next
decade, would have twice the population of the United States. On
current figures its combined GDP would already be a fifth greater
than that of the US, and of course for many of the states they would
expect to have a rapid growth ahead until they caught up with their
western European neighbours. This would make Europe relatively even
richer. It seems unlikely that under such circumstances, a stable and
secure Europe, rich and populous, that US would wish to keep its
100,000 troops based in Europe. However a draw down of these could
lead to a weakening of the NATO transatlantic bond, particularly if
NATO felt it had no real role. From a European perspective therefore
the long term security of the continent must centre on the
development of a European foreign and security policy with an ability
to carry it out on a European basis. We are a long way from that as
yet.</P>
