			<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">As Gordon Brown is finishing his sums for the budget, he may be relieved that the war in Iraq seems to be going so well. The last Gulf War cost around &pound;2bn but most of that was covered by Saudi Arabia and elsewhere. This time he has put aside &pound;3 bn as a prudent provision, and knows there will be few volunteers to help pay the costs. If Iraq is under allied control within the next month, this provision is likely to be enough. However, the longer term arrangements for winning the peace may be much more expensive, and this is another good reason to get the international community involved.<br>
					<br>
					In the mid 1980s, Britain spent over 5% of its GDP on defence. Now, it spends less than half that. The cutbacks at the end of the Cold War amounted to around a third of the frontline in each of the three services. The cuts continued as successive Tory Chancellors squeezed the Ministry of Defence.  Gordon Brown's last public spending round was generous to all the cash starved public services. Defence was pleased to get promised an extra &pound;3.5 billion over the next 3 years, even if in percentage terms this made it the lowest beneficiary in Whitehall. <br>
					<br>
					Since 1997, defence spending will have stayed level in real terms. Yet over this period of the Labour government, personnel and equipment costs have far outpaced inflation, and the tasks have continued to increase. The Balkans, East Timor, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan and Iraq  have added to Northern Ireland, which has gone on longer than had been hoped. Despite the new technologies, &quot;boots on the ground&quot; remain as important as ever. The army has slipped below 100,000 trained soldiers as it has proved impossible to retain enough people. The Fleet air Arm has found it impossible to fill half of its Sea Harrier cockpits, and the RAF has reduced squadrons to try to compensate for pilot shortages. <br>
					<br>
					For a decade, the British military has been living on the leftovers of the Cold War. When it was downsized, the best in people and equipment was retained. But lack of investment has been a continuing problem. All of this is disguised by the extraordinary series of successes on operations. We are seeing this excellence on a shoestring yet again in Basra. <br>
					<br>
					The stories of inadequate radios, melting boots and slow development of friendly fire prevention measures will all be forgotten as Iraq is completed. We now shape our forces to provide political assistance to the United States.  The move away from European approaches to defence will certainly raise costs, and accelerate the problems of underfunding. There seems little enthusiasm for greater rationalisation of defence effort with the rest of Europe to get greater value for money. Nor has there been a great rise in spending on the new post 9/11 terrorist threat. Unlike the USA, we assume we can get by with current resources.<br>
					<br>
					Yet the armed forces have a real problem. They must stem the outflow of trained men and women. This needs much more attention to conditions of service than pay, and will be expensive. On the equipment side, there are many small projects that get delayed each year in the attempt to balance books. The long term procurement programme is reasonably balanced, but to sustain it, useful enhancements get lost. Politically driven procurement decisions, like the bizarre management arrangements for the two new aircraft carriers, ensure that the defence equipment budget is often wasted.<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					Governments need to recognise that if they do no more than keep defence spending level in real terms, then military capability will decline every year. About once every four years, they have to have a major defence review to balance the books. this is not good for the stability of the services. What would change all this would be to recognise that defence inflation is always higher than domestic inflation. <br>
					<br>
					Sensible defence planning would be possible if the MOD could plan on a steady real rise year on year to sustain a military capability to meet the new challenges of a more dangerous world.  It was done once before in the early 1980s when the UK followed a NATO initiative for 3% real growth each year for nearly 7 years. This approach has been adopted in Australia; but strangely the only European political party which has such a policy is neither Tory nor Labour, it is  surprisingly the Liberal Democrats.	</font></p>
