<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The relentless media criticism of the MOD
for providing our troops with inadequate equipment has intensified.
The Observer of 27 February gives a page to "The Ministry of
Disasters - 'Smart' buying has delivered delays, guns that jam and
ships that can't sail". The Today programme seems to relish
highlighting a new problem every week. Every report recycles the
previous catalogue of apparent incompetence. NAO reports are grist to
the mill; disaffected comments from troops in the field or pilots on
web discussion groups are quoted as accepted facts. The latest
scandal is the need for all of the army's SA-80 rifles to be returned
for modifications to prevent jamming in extreme weather conditions.
This follows the revelation that the Tornados, which had been
upgraded to GR4 standard, were now unable to drop precision bombs;
that the army radios were so old that the few that worked could be
intercepted by the Serbs in Kosovo; and that the Royal Navy was
cutting ship speeds to save fuel. The Observer adds the scrapped
defence intelligence computer system, and delays in the Merlin
helicopter, the Eurofighter and the Nimrod upgrade programmes.
Surprisingly, they did not include fast jet pilot shortages, medical
services collapse and the continuing overstretch in the army. </FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Is this some new malaise in Defence? Are
the criticisms valid? If so, who is to blame? And how can MOD do
better? As one government White Paper looking at defence procurement
said: "We must use every means at our disposal to help ensure that we
get both our operational concepts and our weapon systems right first
time". The Defence Secretary  advocating this version of smart
procurement was John Nott in 1981 in a White Paper which regretted
deep cuts in ammunition, fuel, spares and activity.  The paper also
celebrated the excellent progress towards a modern airborne early
warning capability through Nimrod AEW. In the end, Nimrod AEW would
be cancelled after spending around &#163;1 bn because it could not be
made to work. Nor did the Falklands commitment rate more than a
passing mention, despite the fact that it would be the over-riding
operational problem within the year. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	There is a tendency for every new Defence
Secretary to think that MOD can be made more efficient.   There are
great uncertainties in planning and procuring military equipment:
strategic context, technology risk, and domestic factors. The last
decade has seen an extensive move to make defence run on more
business-like lines, and the imminent move to resource accounting is
a further step in this direction. While these moves have certainly
highlighted some of the more bizarre inefficiencies of  defence
arrangements, there is little evidence to suggest that the MOD has
solved the underlying problem. It may be that preparing for unknown
and unquantifiable contingencies is bound to lead to some of the
apparent blunders.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	It is of course grossly unfair to blame
the current MOD ministerial team for a failure in their much
trumpeted Smart Procurement initiative. We shall discover in a decade
or so whether they have instituted a system which performs a little
better. The SA-80 rifle was procured 20 years ago in the light of the
Falklands Conflict experience, and there has been plenty of time to
give priority to rectifying deficiencies over the years since. The
Tornado upgrade programme was designed to extend the total
operational life of this aircraft to over 40 years. It was an
expensive upgrade programme, but much cheaper than buying the next
generation of combat aircraft. Inevitably with new data transfer
systems all the systems have to be recleared for safe operation. Some
will work first time, and receive their clearances. Others may prove
technically challenging, or may take a long time to complete the 
evaluation and testing. It is quite normal to deliver aircraft to a
squadron with only some of the operational clearances finished. 
Thus, we see the Tornado GR4 in flying service, but not yet cleared
to carry and operate a Thermal Imaging Airborne Laser Designator
(TIALD) pod.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	What we may be seeing at the moment is
perhaps a reflection of an overall feeling of concern within the
Defence community. The intensity of operations and the willingness of
the government to take on new commitments worries some. 10,000 troops
were offered by Robin Cook last year as a standby force for the UN.
Yet no new resources were given to the armed forces. The UK took the
lead in Helsinki in December in developing proposals for the creation
of a new EU deployable force of up to 15 brigades with air and sea
support. Again there are no proposals for extra money. Within the
MOD, there is an expectation that some financial relief may be coming
shortly, if only to pay for the Strategic Defence Review. If the
Treasury fails to deliver, watch for much more noise from the MOD
critics, both insiders and commentators.</FONT></P>
