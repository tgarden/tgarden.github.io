			<h3>Woman in the Military</h3>
			<p>by Sir Timothy Garden</p>
		</div>
		<p>William Hague caused a little tremor of excitement when he overturned official Conservative Party policy by saying that he was in favour of women being able to serve on the front-line. For once, he seemed to have got it right even if he upset his Defence spokesman (and emerging leadership threat) Iain Duncan Smith. The Services have not been as eager as they might have been in opening up their ranks to women. Nevertheless, progress has been steady and much military activity is now open to all who can meet the physical and intellectual entrance requirements. Overall 8% of all military personnel and 12.4% of new recruits are women</p>
		<p>The RAF has all its flying and support posts open to women. There were doubts initially about women flying combat aircraft and even more about them in support helicopters over the battlefield. Neither has given any real problems. The particular worries about the high training costs (a Tornado pilot costs nearly &pound;6 million to train) and the prospect of women leaving early to have a family are less relevant today, when retention of men is equally difficult. Only the RAF Regiment continues to exclude women, and it is difficult to understand why that bar should remain, particularly as they allow them in as Reservists.</p>
		<p>In the Royal Navy the worries were somewhat different. The close confines of a warship for prolonged periods at sea gave rise to concerns about discipline. In the event, the story has been less exciting than the tabloids would have us believe. Commanders report that there are discipline problems, but in total they are perhaps fewer than they were in the days of all male ship&#146;s companies. The trouble is that some of the disciplinary difficulties are more interesting to the press and so get greater coverage. The more important issue is whether the ship operates better or worse with a mixed crew. The anecdotal evidence is that there is a considerable improvement in warfighting capability. This is put down, in part, to the men not wishing to be outdone by their women colleagues. The Royal Navy seems to be thinking about moving forward its policy to the 'manning' of submarines. Again there is no logical reason why women could not do the tasks of a submarine crew. There are some medical concerns about the noxious atmosphere after prolonged operations, but presumably a bit of work on improving that would be good for the health of the men as well. Perhaps the unspoken worry is the reactions of wives at home with their husbands spending months confined with female sailors. This is not a trivial problem if it affects retention.</p>
		<p>The army has been the slowest of the Services to open up its roles to women. The technical and support areas were the first. There has however been a marked reluctance to put women in units which could find themselves in the immediate battlefield area. This can cause inter-Service anomalies. The RAF is able to use women pilots to fly the helicopters carrying the male troops around the battlefield. The army reluctance is to an extent understandable. Soldiering is a physically arduous activity, and many young men cannot achieve the necessary physical strength and stamina. Women are on average smaller and less strong. Nevertheless there are women who can meet the demands of being a combat soldier. Perhaps more important is the army culture. They believe that a fighting unit needs to be a cohesive social group, and that this is more difficult to achieve in a mixed group. Much of this attitude may stem from Victorian thinking, but there is little doubt that soldiers are reluctant to accept women into their units (this is true also when they are forced to take male soldiers with different cultural values). Time must change these attitudes.</p>
		<p>The media will continue to focus on stories about sexual discipline problems and women who fail to make the grade in the Services. The latest epic of the female army soldier going AWOL appears to have both elements to the story, so that even The Guardian feels the need to run it. Maybe the replacement of Sir Walter Raleigh&#146;s statue outside the MOD by a bronze memorial to the women of World War 2 will remind the senior military staff that they need to keep working at increasing the opportunities for women in the Services. If they do not, there can be little public sympathy for their personnel shortages.</p>
