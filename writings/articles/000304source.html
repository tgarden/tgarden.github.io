<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The well oiled Whitehall machine seems to
have managed the impossible in the first week of March. While
providing more aid to the disaster in Mozambique than almost any
other member of the international community, it has managed to give
an impression of bureaucratic incompetence and unnecessary delay.
Tony Blair could have been doing his follow up to Kosovo as the
Saviour of Africa. Instead we have an apparent row between the MOD
and DIFD stealing the headlines.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">What are the facts? Mozambique deserves
particular help from the UK. It has done a remarkably good job of
dragging itself forward after years of debilitating post colonial
civil war. The colonial power was Portugal, and it speaks volumes
that the new democratic government there chose to join the
Commonwealth. The UK has taken a lead in forgiving debt to
Mozambique, and has provided significant aid, which has been
generally well spent. The current flood disaster could not have been
predicted. It is not an annual weather phenomenon as it is in
Bangladesh. It may be a result of global warming, which seems to be
giving rise to more intense weather events. The aid agencies, such as
Oxfam, had expected the waters to subside when the first flooding
happened 3 weeks earlier. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Once the catastrophic inundation occurred,
it was clear that helicopters were the only way to rescue people and
transport food, water and medical supplies to the regions. Maputo is
some 5,500 miles from London. A helicopter flies at about 150 mph.
Simple calculations show that it will take 5 days of flying over 7
hours a day even if it were possible to travel in a straight line.
Overflying rights, fuel availability, servicing facilities and
terrain would all make it considerably longer. The preferred
alternative is to transport helicopters over such distances by sea or
air. From a technical point of view, sea is best as the helicopter
can be serviced and made ready during the voyage. Fuel and spares can
also be carried. However, sea travel takes even longer, although
there is more assurance that they will arrive in flying condition.
Air freighting is quickest. However, each helicopter has to be
prepared as freight. The rotors are removed and other major sections
may need to be stripped down. The rescue operation needs the biggest
helicopters possible, but that limits the aircraft available to carry
them to Russian or US military cargo aircraft. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The MOD undoubtedly considered all these
options and decided the fastest way that it could offer assistance
would be to hire an Antonov transport to carry 4 stripped down Puma
helicopters. It would take time to prepare the Pumas and also time
and engineering facilities to rebuild them at the other end. The
Antonov hire does not come cheap (&#163;270,000 quoted in the Press).
For all these reasons, it would be entirely rational for DIFD to
decide that more could be done more quickly by spending the aid money
in South Africa rather than the MOD. All of this could have been
explained as the decisions were made.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Instead there has been an unseemly debate
over whether the UK help was delayed because the MOD wanted to charge
DIFD full costs rather than marginal costs. We are all quick to
criticise the MOD when it appears to be being incompetent in its
budgetary processes. It has been suggested that the Government should
provide instant resources for such catastrophes. It can and it does.
Yet the provision of a pot of gold does not change the potential for
a fight over how much each department will gets for its tasking. The
MOD is being asked to do more and more without a budget uplift. It is
scarcely surprising that it wants to be clear on the budgetary
implications of taking on every new task. The pressures of
accountability are making joined-up government creak. Perhaps the
role of the Treasury in such unpredictable circumstances needs to be
better defined.</FONT></P>
