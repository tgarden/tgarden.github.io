			<h3><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">Introduction</font></h3>
			<p><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">It is a great pleasure to be invited here today to talk about the future of European security. After centuries of war between the states that make up the European continent, we now plan on how we can work together to improve not only our own security, but also bring peace and stability further afield. Europe really does want to be a force for good in the world. We are bringing in the countries to the East who were separated from us throughout the Cold War in the most extraordinary and hopeful period of enlargement. <br>
					<br>
					But if we no longer have to worry about imminent attack by the Soviet Union, as we did for half a century, we have a series of new threats. During the 90's we saw the trouble that the break up of Yugoslavia could call. Scenes of mass killing, refugee flow, ethnic cleansing and anarchy. These right next to us. We learned over the decade a number of lessons on how to tackle the problem, and while the Balkans are not yet ready to come into EU membership, it is no longer unthinkable. The terrible attacks on the USA in 2001 by a al-Qaeda woke us all up to the implications of globalised international terrorism. <br>
					<br>
					We are not yet in a world where all nations live in harmony with each other, or even with their own peoples. The effects can spread fast and far. In June this year, Javier Solana, produced an excellent paper called: A secure Europe in a better world. It was designed to some extent to mirror the US national security strategy document that was produced in September 2002. It identifies very similar new challenges to the US document: International terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, failing states and international crime. <br>
					<br>
					This has provided the start for the development of a more coherent security strategy in the EU. But there is a long way to go &#150; as disputes this year over the Iraq conflict have shown. I shall try to give you a brief look at what has been happening in the attempts to make the EU more capable to play a role in its own and global security. The tale is full of paradoxes and false starts, but it is important to know how far we have come, and what prospect there is for further progress. Too often the security dimension of the EU is used as the football of domestic politics. Cheap shots at the dangers of a European Army undermine domestic support for measures that can not only make us more secure, at lower cost, but can also allow us to be partners with the United States and perhaps have more influence over the way these complex international problems are tackled.</font></p>
			<h3><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">Uncertain Progress </font></h3>
			<p><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">Until 1998, successive British governments had blocked the development of coherent European defence arrangements. The WEU was used as a mechanism to prevent true European capabilities from emerging. The feeling among British political leaders was that a stronger, more independent, European defence capability threatened to undermine NATO. The UK wanted the USA locked in to European security through NATO. The UK policy change in the autumn of 1998 was a watershed in the development of an EU defence capability, and led to the Anglo-French accord at St Malo in December. This in turn allowed  a succession of summits and meetings  through 1999 to enable the formulation of real aspirations at Helsinki at the end of the year.  The Helsinki Headline Goals called for EU states to be able to provide a force up to 60,000 troops with air and sea support that could be deployed within 2 months and sustained for a year. This may not sound very demanding, but look at the difficulty that the US is having sustaining a force of 120,000 in Iraq currently. Coincidently, Europe had recognised how dependent it had become on US military power earlier that year in Kosovo. The European members of NATO had promised to rectify their military weakness through the Defence Capabilities Initiative (DCI) of the Washington summit in April 1999. Yet  subsequently, little has been done to provide these promised enabling capabilities. <br>
					<br>
					The following year, the development of the EU institutions and the commitments progressed well. Nevertheless, real military activity continued to be done in the Balkans through NATO, and, for the UK,  bilaterally in Sierra Leone, or through the United Nations in East Timor, or bilaterally with the US over Iraq no fly zones. This was not surprising given that the EU had not yet declared an operational capability and the organisation was still at the planning stage. It looked at the time as though there was some reluctance for the EU to push ahead with liaison arrangements for NATO, which was curious given the acknowledged dependence on NATO for shared assets. <br>
					<br>
					However, 2001 was not a good year for the fragile emerging European arrangements. The second commitments conference at the end of the year was having to deal with the missing enabling capabilities and how they would be brought into being. These gaps included logistics, force protection, air/sea transport, combat search and rescue, precision weapons, command and control, surveillance, intelligence and reconnaissance. But the real change of focus came with the attacks on Washington and New York on 11 September. NATO simultaneously showed both its cohesion and its impotence. The invoking of Article 5 for the first time was a powerful political signal of support for the USA; but the reality was that the US would not use NATO to prosecute its war on terrorism. Such European contribution as there was for the operation in Afghanistan, and the subsequent pursuit of Al-Qaeda, was done on an exclusively bilateral basis with the US. <br>
					<br>
					The sidelining of NATO, the new terrorist threat, and the large rise in US defence spending might have been expected to put a new sense of urgency into developing usable European capabilities. In fact the reverse seems to have been the case. The Europeans have looked inward at their own national security, and most show little enthusiasm for the new US power projection strategy. They have been demoralised by the scale of the increase in US defence spending, which makes the prospect of matching American technology and being interoperable seem even more difficult. Nor are they happy at the prospect of a division of labour, which leaves Europe doing the nation building (in the Balkans, in Afghanistan and perhaps in Iraq) while the USA does the quick in and out high intensity campaigns. <br>
					<br>
					NATO was aware of this danger and members made a number of bold undertakings at the Prague Summit in  November 2002. NATO looked to reduce the list of 59 DCI weaknesses to a handful, in the hope that members would at least address the most important. A parallel EU exercise through the Helsinki Headline Goal process is trying to put pressure on EU members to fill these same gaps. The approaches are still fragmented. NATO also backed the establishment of a NATO Response Force (NRF), which would provide a very fast (perhaps within a week) deployable modern military force of up to 20,000 troops. These new initiatives remain unlikely to be delivered without a coherent European view on how and when they might be used. The experience of 2003 over the Iraq conflict has made this even more difficult.<br>
					<br>
					The EU and NATO were both damaged by the diplomatic wrangling in the run up to the operation. With the exception of the UK, even those EU nations which supported the US led intervention provided little in the way of military capability for the Iraq operation. As we enter a period where relationships need to be rebuilt, there are a number of problems. The US has formulated its national strategy  to deal with the way that it sees the future of international security. NATO is still working to its 1999 strategic concept, which badly needs updating. In theory, the EU is still preparing its defence capabilities against a template of the Petersberg Tasks , which reflects the world a decade ago. At the EU foreign ministers meeting in early May 2003, it was agreed that the EU needed to develop its own strategic doctrine. This is an important step in the process towards producing appropriate capabilities. The first output of this process, the Solana Paper,  contains many strands which echo analysis in the US national strategy.  While new threats from terrorism, proliferation, failed states and organised crime are identified, the EU responses are more concerned about using the international system than pre-emptive military force.  The work in developing this strategy continues, but is unlikely to produce hard  agreed military requirements in the near term.</font></p>
			<h3><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">Mixed Messages </font></h3>
			<p><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">Meanwhile there have been a series of events in 2003 which send mixed messages about the trends in ESDP. In early February UK Prime Minister Tony Blair met with President Chirac of France in Le Touquet. Despite the public arguments between the two leaders over Iraq, they reinforced their St Malo agreement to advance ESDP and encourage new defence capabilities. On 29 April, the leaders of Belgium, France, Germany and Luxembourg met and launched a new EU planning capability to be housed at Tervuren in Belgium. This was seen as a deepening of the divide between pro and anti US camps in Europe. The US, supported strongly by the UK, had always argued that there was no need for the EU to duplicate the planning facilities available at SHAPE, as these could be used for EU as well as NATO operations. A successful transfer of responsibility in Macedonia from NATO to the EU gave hope that ESDP was at last getting practical. The agreement to deploy an EU force to Bunia in the Democratic Republic of Congo was taken in May 2003. This operation gave an example of the EU deploying well outside the immediate European area without help from NATO.<br>
					<br>
					Meanwhile, in response to the Tervuren initiative, the US made it clear that the EU would not be able to take over from NATO in Bosnia if members were going to duplicate planning capabilities available under Berlin plus arrangements from NATO.  This deepening split between old and new Europe may have been halted by a Berlin meeting on 21 September 2003 between the UK, French and German leaders. It has been reported that  at this meeting, the UK has reversed its long term hostility to an independent EU planning capability.  It is still not clear whether this represents true co-operation, or whether the UK has decided that it can work against the project better from the inside. Italy subsequently muddied the waters further with proposals for a hybrid national/EU planning arrangement. Finally, at the EU Summit in Rome in early October 2003, it was announced that the EU would after all take over from NATO in Bosnia in mid 2004 with the UK as the lead nation. <br>
					<br>
					It is difficult to make a clear judgment about the long term trends for ESDP after such a roller coaster ride in 2003. The institutional arrangements between NATO and the EU have remained difficult in practice, despite the hard won practical arrangements agreed under Berlin Plus. The differences on strategy and roles have not been solved. The series of declarations on improving capabilities seem endless. Another was made in Rome on 3 October 2003. Yet, even with a general agreement on where the key enabling military capabilities are deficient, the question remains as to how Europe is to find the necessary funds for new capabilities. <br>
					 Pressure for Integration<br>
					 <br>
					All proposals for more capable European forces will require serious investment. The Solana Paper calls for more resources for defence. While European nations are to a greater or lesser extent restructuring their forces, there is little sign that new money will be made available for expensive enabling capabilities. Defence budgets at best are held level in real terms, and this is insufficient to fund either major new capabilities, or maintain force levels over a period of time. Yet plans for specialist contributions, such as the NATO Response Force proposal of 2002, will need early funding if they are to be achieved. In addition, the range of  modern enabling capabilities identified during the Helsinki Headline Goal process and the Prague Capabilities Commitment remain unaffordable by individual nations.<br>
					 <br>
					There are three complementary pressures on European nations to start taking forward sharing some force elements. First, pooling offers the opportunity for lower overhead costs, and the resources released might then be used to fund new capabilities. Second, joint owned-joint operated forces would make the new enabling capabilities more affordable on a shared basis. Thirdly, pooled forces would drive moves towards greater interoperability and common doctrine and equipment. In time it might even lead to more sensible procurement practices.<br>
					 <br>
					There is one other consideration which could increase the attractiveness of pooled capabilities to European governments. The experience of the Afghanistan campaign has increased doubts about the relevance of NATO to future high intensity campaigns even when there is consensus for action. The only NATO contribution was its one joint owned joint operated) force: AWACs. All other contributions to the US operation in Afghanistan were arranged on a bilateral national basis. If Europe is to be seen as a relevant partner with the US when planning future operations, it would benefit not only from fielding  European capabilities which were able to operate alongside US forces, but also by fielding them as joint owned joint operated capabilities. This would mean that Europe would be in the loop over any decision to use such force elements.</font></p>
			<h3><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">Towards European capabilities</font></h3>
			<p><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">The smaller EU nations will be forced down the path of integration as they lose capabilities. The joint naval arrangement between the Dutch and the Belgians is a good illustration of what is possible. There are many things which we have today which could be pooled. Air transport is a good example, and Germany has set up an organisation which could manage such an arrangement. It looks as though progress may be made in sharing an air transport capability among some European nations. However to produce near term capability and cost benefits, it needs to be done with what is in place now, not on the back of some uncompetitive long term European procurement plan. Much of the equipment which could be pooled is American, because that is where common capabilities exist. An  example might be tactical air transport using C130s  , which are fielded in 10 EU countries. <br>
					 <br>
					One of the great missed opportunities, both from the military and commercial  aspect, has been the failure of states to pool the Eurofighter force. With a pooled force the support costs would have  been much less, and the aircraft configuration control could be maintained unlike the Tornado. It would also allow smaller European nations to buy a handful of Eurofighters to add to a much larger force. The cost benefits between such a Eurofighter buy, Joint Strike Fighter purchase or upgrades to F16 or F18s might work out very differently then. Failing to pool the Eurofighter means it will cost far more for each nation to operate and do far less than it could have done with a little more imagination. It will also sell to fewer European countries.<br>
					 <br>
					Even if the politics of such pooling of major combat capabilities are too difficult, there are opportunities for less contentious sharing of costly capabilities. In particular contracted out services or  public private partnership projects could be done on a European wide basis instead of nationally. An examination  of potential areas suggested that it would be possible to extend national contractorised support of the military to EU-wide contracts in the areas of: motor transport, freight distribution, language training, equipment repair facilities, non-operational IT systems, base support and a range of specialist training. <br>
					<br>
					At the more operational level, the requirement for air-to-air refuelling (AAR) capabilities for the EU provide a great opportunity for new thinking. Whether it is for Petersberg Tasks or high intensity warfighting, there is a shortfall in AAR resources. The UK has been examining national proposals for providing a new capability through a public/private partnership scheme, and is expected to make a decision in the next few months.  It would appear that there is an opportunity for an EU wide AAR capability funded by member states. However, there are few signs that EU governments are yet ready to be this bold.<br>
					 <br>
					These examples suggest some practical areas where the development of European Force Elements and common support and logistic services could provide building blocks for the strengthening of European defence contributions. They would make more effective use of European national defence budgets through the removal of the cost overhang of separate support systems. Valuable as such individual initiatives would be, they would not by themselves represent a coherent new security contribution by Europe. They would however illustrate how significant improvements in effectiveness could be achieved through merging particular national capabilities and sharing common services.</font></p>
			<h3><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">EU  Defence Budget</font></h3>
			<p><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">For this approach to become coherent, it would be necessary to develop a planning and budgetary system at the European level.  Eventually there would be a requirement for a European Defence Budget. If such an accounting system were managed by the EU, members would provide either defence capability or money as their contribution. This would have a number of beneficial effects: not only would the free ride by some members be stopped, but nations would probably prefer to improve their military capabilities rather than to contribute money to the employment and industries of other nations. <br>
					<br>
					Peer pressure, as well as legally binding commitments to a given level of defence expenditure, might come to seem markedly more compelling to the participants than the distinctly low key incentives that have characterised co-operation in the past. A virtuous circle of improved military capability and effective European defence could be established. There would be many problems in assessing the true worth of each contribution, but the process would also make the planning and audit at the European level more effective. There would need to be a full audit system to value and assess contributions. Unfortunately the individual concerns about national sovereignty in the defence field make such developments politically very difficult.<br>
				</font></p>
			<h3><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">Trends and Challenges</font></h3>
			<p><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">I have outlined the significant milestones on the road to a more coherent European Security and Defence Policy underpinned by useful military capabilities. The trendline is more difficult to plot. The key players in making progress are France and the UK. Each has historically adopted a more global approach to security and has tried to provide the necessary national military capability to underpin that global policy. Working together, they can drive forward a more effective EU military capability. Germany may play a more important role once it restructures its forces. There are signs that it is at last prepared to bite this bullet. The danger is that the restructuring will merely turn into cost cutting.<br>
					<br>
					The need for an agreement on the new Constitution offers both an opportunity and a risk for progress on ESDP. Enlargement of the EU complicates the future decision making process, but small countries as well as large are sensitive about their sovereignty in the defence area. Reform of the EU institutions is perhaps more necessary in the field of security than anywhere else. The division of responsibilities between Council of Ministers, Commission and Parliament does not make for a coherent, transparent and fully democratic approach to security policy. <br>
					<br>
					Progress for the EU has been slow, but the building bricks are there. The Solana paper gives the start of a common strategic approach. The experience of real operations will inform the development process, and shows that the EU is prepared to act either with NATO or on its own. Nor does the EU feel constrained to act only near its borders. In the end, the EU is likely to provide the necessary diplomatic and military capabilities to support its global interests. The military security dimension remains a key issue for Europe in its future relations with the US. To be cast in the role of sweeper up after America is not an enticing prospect. Without addressing the shortfalls in military capability,  EU member states will find themselves less and less able to operate individually or collectively to support their common interests. Nor will they have a strong voice in where and how future operations are conducted.<br>
					 <br>
					The particular difficulties that have been thrown up by Iraq have certainly bruised the EU  and NATO. Rebuilding European defence relationships is now vital. Work on a new security doctrine is an important aspect of this, but it is clear what new capabilities are needed now, whatever  additional needs the doctrine may come out with. An agenda to generate new capabilities through greater integration could play a part in freeing up resources for these new capabilities. The need for an EU defence budget to manage such a system is urgent. Member states might start this process by allocating a small proportion of their defence budgets to a common fund to start producing useful capabilities on a supranational basis.<br>
					<br>
					The best hope for a progressive development of ESDP comes from the increasing complexity of operational tasks with the EU is prepared to undertake. Macedonia, Bunia and Bosnia perhaps point the way ahead. Doing real military tasks will provide both experience of working together and confidence in what can be done. Over the longer term the costs of defence will force even the least willing governments into greater integration of military capabilities.</font></p>
			<h3><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">Conclusion</font></h3>
			<p><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">Let me conclude by repeating that we still live in a dangerous world which we cannot ignore. While the desperate damger of the Cold War is no more, we need to bring peace justice and stability to many areas of the world. This is not just because it is morally right for us to do, but it is also in our own interests. Europe can take on this task far better as the EU than piecemeal each state doing its little bit. It means that we continue to need military forces, but in order to afford them we shall have to face to the need for greater integration and a common foreign and security policy.  If we don't we shall have to hope the USA will keep the peace for us.</font></p>
