<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Readers of this column over the past two
years will have followed the record of hard work that the Blair
Government has put in to getting European defence moving. The
pledging conference in Brussels at the end of November should have
been a time for celebration as words began to turn into deeds.
Instead, the Government has been cast in the role of selling out to
Europe by much of the media. This has been further fuelled by the
Conservative opposition enjoying the chance to bash Labour on both
Europe and Defence at the same time.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The critics worry about the effect of the
new arrangements on NATO in general and on the relationship with the
United States in particular. They fear that effort will be wasted
over a European force that can do nothing, but duplicates much of the
NATO superstructure. They worry about a European Army run from
Brussels. They believe that UK forces, already overstretched, cannot
take on yet more commitments. These are all legitimate concerns that
need to be thought through. The problem is that from the deeply
entrenched positions on both sides of the political divide over
Europe, it is difficult to find anyone listening to the
answers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">It is true to say that in 1998, Tony Blair
realised that something had to be done to stop the wasting away of
defence capabilities throughout the EU. The public process began with
the historic agreement at St Malo in December 1998, when it was
agreed that both France and the UK would lead the development of a
better European capability to undertake the "Petersberg Tasks". These
tasks are those which do not include direct territorial defence,
which remains the major task for NATO. They might  be peacekeeping,
humanitarian intervention, disaster relief or rescue of EU citizens
from troublespots. The rationale that the United States might not
always want to undertake the European's dirty work seems a reasonable
one. Where the United States is prepared to take part, then NATO will
be the first choice organisation to conduct such operations.</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The experience of Kosovo in 1999 underlined
the inadequacy of European capability. The operation was conducted in
Europe's back yard, and was a relatively minor campaign in the scheme
of things. Yet the US had to provide 80% of the useful capability for
the air campaign. The assembling of a ground force, even for an
unopposed entry into Kosovo, proved to be difficult and extended in
time for the Europeans. Yet they field 2 million men under arms and
3000 combat aircraft. EU nations combined spend just over half the
amount that the US spends on defence, despite the two regions have
virtually equal GDPs. The NATO Washington summit of April 1999
identified a long list of shortfalls in European capabilities, and
all the members agreed to rectify these deficiencies. At that summit,
NATO welcomed the European Security and Defence Initiative as an
important method of getting better capabilities. In concert with the
NATO work, the EU pushed on with developing a scheme to produce these
necessary capabilities. Through a series of summits and bi-lateral
discussions, with the UK playing a leading role, it was finally
agreed at Helsinki in December 1999, that the EU would aim to field a
deployable force of about 60,000 men by 2003. This force should be
able to deploy within two months and stay in theatre for up to a
year. Appropriate support from the air and sea would be provided, and
the necessary strategic lift, command and control, and other combat
support would be fielded. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The event that has caused so much tabloid
angst currently is the conference at which each EU nation indicated
what it would contribute to this embryo rapid deployment force. For
the UK, the British Government has put a sizable offer on the table.
The army will provide either an Armoured or Mechanised brigade, each
of which could be sustained for at least a year; or an Air Assault
brigade which would be deployed for up to six months. Combat Support
enabling capabilities such as Artillery, and Short Range Air Defence,
and Attack Helicopters could be deployed in addition. The Navy has
committed an aircraft carrier, two nuclear powered submarines,  four
destroyers / frigates, support vessels; and an amphibious task group,
including one helicopter landing platform and an amphibious brigade.
The aircraft carrier, helicopter landing platform and submarines
could not necessarily be sustained continuously for a whole year. In
the air, we have offered up to 72 combat aircraft (including Sea
Harriers), with associated support aircraft including strategic
transport. This number would be available for six months to cover
initial theatre entry. For a longer term commitment the total would
reduce. As can be seen, the offer has constraints on time that may
not fully meet the Helsinki requirement, and other nations will need
to be able to fill the gaps. It is not therefore correct to assume
this commitment will of itself increase overstretch. It has been
carefully calibrated to match availability and sustainability of
forces. Overstretch comes from the general undermanning of key areas
of all 3 Services.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Geoff Hoon is right to say that the new
force proposals are not a recipe for a European Army. The UK has had
European force arrangements in a number of areas for many years.
However, the real worry remains about how the missing capabilities
are to be found. The new force will improve reaction times and ensure
forces are trained for the new roles of the post Cold War world. It
will not of itself provide the needed airlift, sealift, air-to-air
refuelling, intelligence, reconnaissance, command and control,
communication, suppression of enemy air defence, precision weapons
and the many other bits of kit that Europe needs both for European
operations and for use in NATO. The optimist will say that the
mechanisms are now in place to start making European defence work.
The pessimist will say that the deckchairs have been rearranged on
the Titanic, but Europe remains unprepared to pay the price for its
security. In either case, the Government seems to be doing its best,
and deserves a better press.</FONT></P>
