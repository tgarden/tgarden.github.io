			<p><font size="-2" color="#0b0b0b">Strategic analysts seem to be turning into semantic experts. The subtle shifts in language from Government spokesmen and the Prime Minister are reminiscent of the way Kremlin watchers would examine the latest pronouncements by Soviet leaders at the height of the Cold War. Yet it is important to know what drove Tony Blair to such passionate belief in the need for military action in Iraq.<br>
					<br>
					As the sequence of events unfolded from the middle of last year, many of us were convinced that President Bush was preparing for a military intervention regardless. Indeed the debates in international conferences were often more about the likely date than whether such a war would happen. Tony Blair expended a great deal of effort on bringing the issue to the United Nations. George Bush spoke at the UN on 12 September 2002, but his language made it clear that he expected the Security Council to back his view of the need for urgent action. When it proved possible to get unanimous support for Resolution 1441, which called on Saddam Hussein to show that he had destroyed all his capabilities for weapons of mass destruction,  Tony Blair seems to have assumed that he would also get international support for military action within the US timetable.<br>
					<br>
					As we know now, the Security Council was less convinced of the need for an urgent rush to war, and the necessary majority for war was not forthcoming. Yet Tony Blair remained a passionate advocate for the urgent need for military intervention. As the Ministry of Defence report on Iraq, published last week, makes clear, we sent a bigger force even than the maximum planning assumptions. In practical terms, the UK sent everything it could. Other nations like Spain and Italy, which had supported President Bush, sent no troops to fight when it came to the crunch.<br>
					<br>
					Tony Blair's rationale was clear and he swung public opinion in the country. After an anti-war sentiment that got more than a million people on the street, the British population swung round to support the war. Parliament, with some reluctance agreed. The Attorney General, in a rather minimalist fashion, agreed it was legal under international law. The language of urgent threat had worked. We had come to believe that there were chemical and biological weapons at the ready. There were said to be up to 20 longer range missiles that could put our bases in Cyprus under threat. Saddam, it was argued, was trying hard to get back in the nuclear business, and we needed to do something urgently.<br>
					<br>
					Now as the occupying forces continue to turn up no signs of nuclear, biological or chemical weapons, or the missiles to deliver them, it is clear the threat was much less immediate than suggested. Nor has there been any evidence linking Iraq with al Qaeda, which was one concern in the public mind. For this reason, we hear the Prime Minister now talking about the threat of unconventional weapon &quot;programmes&quot; in Iraq. This is an important change in the argument. Real weapons are no longer important. It is the research into such weapons that we fought the war about. <br>
					<br>
					There is an argument raging in academic circles about the new US doctrine of pre-emption. Their strategy says that it will be necessary in some case to intervene before a country has developed these powerful weapons. Tony Blair seems now to be moving the debate in this direction. However, Parliament should not lose sight of the argument that was made in March when it agreed to go to war. Then we were talking about real weapons not paper tigers.</font></p>
