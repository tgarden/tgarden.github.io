<P><B>The Security Context</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The 80 senior military, civil service, diplomats, police and
industrialists who attend the Royal College of Defence Studies study
those factors which will shape their national security in the future.
Inevitably views are coloured by topical events. In that respect,
1995 was full of mixed signals. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>For much of the year, the prognosis for the Former Republic of
Yugoslavia was poor. The peace settlement negotiated at Dayton meant
that the year ended on a more optimistic note for the region. It also
provided a way out for the UN, which had suffered considerable unfair
criticism throughout the year. The cease-fire in Northern Ireland
held throughout 1995, and there was a new feeling  of optimism. In
the Middle East, the peace process continued at a remarkable rate. HM
King Hussein spoke to the Course about his hopes for the future. The
Members who visited Israel, Jordan, Syria and Egypt reported back not
only the optimistic views gained at first hand from Prime Minister
Rabin, but also on the difficult issues which lie ahead. The murder
of Mr Rabin did not appear to affect the peace process adversely, and
the first signs of a possible understanding between Syria and Israel
were emerging at the end of the year.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Not every portent in 1995 was good. There were natural disasters,
atrocities, new terrorist acts, areas of heightened tension, and
internal wars. The earthquakes in Japan and Mexico were reminders of
how unpredictable natural events can dislocate modern societies.
Algeria, Sri Lanka, Rwanda, Burundi and Chechenia showed that
conflicts could still take many forms and result in high numbers of
casualties.  Terrorism struck two of the leading nations of the world
with the Oklahoma bombing and the gas attack on the Tokyo subway. 
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Aside from these major events of direct interest to those studying
international security issues, there were other pervasive themes in
1995. Expansion of both the European Union and NATO were topics of
continuing importance. The course members from Central Europe made
sure that their nations' aspirations were not forgotten. However,
little was said by the experts that  indicated there would be an
early expansion in either the economic or security organisations. The
future of both Russia and China was a source of continuous
speculation.  It was hard to find optimists for  Russian prospects in
the short term.  </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Economic and environmental issues were all pervasive as the
regions were examined. It was clear that the globalisation of markets
was seen by many to have brought a completely new degree of
interdependence among sovereign states. This was having profound
effects on the way in which governments could operate. The nature of
democracy is a key element of the course; and there were mixed
signals in this area as well. The balance of the rights of the
individual against the needs of society was a recurring issue. The
Far East tiger economies were more confident in their advocacy of the
individual having to  serve the greater good of the state. At the
same time, the Internet at last arrived in the public consciousness,
and showed the possibility of a future world of connected individuals
where geographical location had little relevance.  Governments, which
were already losing control of their economies to global markets,
might also find that their voters operated in a global information
and communication network with profound long-term consequences.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The future of the nation state is a key consideration on any
course which seeks to prepare its participants for possible emerging
security concerns. Here the portents in 1995 have not been
encouraging. The international community appeared to be making
precedents for moves towards states being defined by ethnicity rather
than historic or natural boundaries with balanced representation of
minorities. It will take some time to see how the settlement in
Bosnia turns out in practice. However, a continuing development of
ever smaller ethnically homogeneous states is likely to provide a
multitude of difficult security issues for the future. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>The 1995 Research Papers</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Against this backdrop, nearly 80 research papers were produced by
the members of the course. The topics were wide ranging and this
collection is indicative of the very high standard of analysis. The
seven papers featured here are representative only in the sense that
they illustrate the diversity of topics. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Economics is now perhaps the most important aspect in any
examination of security problems. In his paper, Brigadier Michael
Charlton-Weedy of the British Army examines the impact of deficit
financing on the development and execution of foreign and security
policies. For the non-specialist, he gives a clear and understandable
explanation of the relevant economic practices. He then takes four
case studies, the USA, Sweden, Zimbabwe and Japan, to derive a model
of behavioural patterns. He concludes that the external policies of
some medium size states are influenced by the needs of deficit
financing, and that the situation is amenable to modelling. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In his paper on the role of government in riding the Third Wave,
Brigadier General Robert Dees of the US Army looks at how the
information revolution will affect the world.  For anyone wanting to
understand the issues raised by the new world-wide information
infrastructure, his paper provides an easy to read guide. He explains
how the availability of free global information will change the
nature of democracy. He also draws our attention to the new security
concerns raised by the prospect of information warfare. Among his
conclusions, there is a note of optimism for the developing nations,
which he believes have the opportunity to make a rapid transition to
information societies.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Brigadier Joe Singh of the Guyana Defence Force focuses on
non-military threats to emerging democracies, and the role that the
military has to play in countering such threats. He identifies these
threats as including migrants, drugs and  environmental degradation.
He develops a practical scheme for organising inter-state
co-operation to counter these threats. He shows how the armed forces
of these states can play a key role in protecting the states from
these non-traditional threats, and thus ensure that democracy
continues to grow.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>These first three papers have all considered different pressures
on states which shape both their internal and external policies. In
his paper on human rights and the limits of sovereignty, Brigadier
Tony Milton of the Royal Marines draws a parallel between the new
economic interdependence and the way in which values are becoming
transnational. He examines the implications for state sovereignty  in
the light of the growth of influence of human rights.  He reviews the
development in Europe and in the United States, and shows how states
are now being constrained. He reminds us of the role  the CSCE 
played in using human rights issues to undermine the Eastern Bloc. He
concludes that the greatest erosion of state sovereignty has been the
advent of the doctrine of humanitarian intervention. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>While there seems little indication of a declining need for armed
forces, Brigadier Anthony Palmer of the British Army examines the 
effect that changing values in society are likely to have on these
forces. He argues that we are passing through a defining moment of
change, which we will only recognise with the benefit of hindsight.
He believes that the military is becoming increasingly isolated in
modern democratic societies. In using the British Army as a model, he
examines  the relationships between the political decision makers and
the military, and also the effect of the business culture on the
armed forces. He shows that there are difficult choices ahead in
trying to balance the imperative of operational effectiveness against
the often conflicting nature of society.  He concludes that the Armed
Forces cannot remain distant from society, and that a more
self-confident and enlightened approach could be taken to some
societal issues of today.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>A number of the research papers examined regional issues, and the
two chosen for inclusion in this collection are of particular
interest in providing new ideas. Colonel Zolton Szenes of the
Hungarian Army looks at the prospects for the defence industries of
Central Europe. Following the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, they have
lost their traditional closed markets. Their own economies cannot
afford to spend much on new equipment, and many of their more distant
customers are now off limits. Colonel Szenes focuses on the region's
most developed industries in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and
his own country.  In a sober appraisal, he concludes that the
countries need to seek closer industrial ties with one another
despite the political difficulties.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>One area of the world that continues to cause concern in the
security field is the Indian sub-continent. The Non-Proliferation
Treaty negotiations went well in 1995, but did little to change the
potential for future nuclear stand-off between India and Pakistan.
The College always has a member from both nations on the course, and
this does much to promote a wider understanding of the security
concerns of each state. This year, Commodore Gul Malik of the
Pakistan Navy has reviewed Indian strategic objectives and analysed
their implications for neighbouring states. While identifying the
risks, he concludes with an optimistic view for the future of the
region. He argues that the mutual military threats between India and
Pakistan are totally incredible, and cost more to sustain than either
can afford. He sketches out a process that could lead to a regime of
stability, peace and co-operation in which both nations can flourish.

<P><B>The Role of RCDS</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>These seven papers give a flavour of the wide range of the topics
covered by the 1995 RCDS Course. It was another post Cold War year
with contradictory portents for the future. The importance of
economic power was ever more evident. A new form of internationalism
through world-wide computer connectivity began to reach the political
agenda. Peace processes continued in Northern Ireland, the Middle
East and Bosnia. One indicator of the will for nations to cooperate
and work to better future was in the composition of the Royal College
of Defence Studies course itself. Every region was represented, and
the senior policy-makers of 38 nations (the most diverse ever) were
able to consider in depth each others' problems and aspirations. The
security challenges ahead will be addressed by an increasing
world-wide network of RCDS graduates.</P>
