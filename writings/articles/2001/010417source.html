			<h3>What now for Israel?</h3>
			<p><i>By Sir Timothy Garden</i></p>
		</div>
		<p>The plucky pilgrims retracing Christ&#146;s steps along the Via Dolorosa on Good Friday bring the troubles in Jerusalem back on to the world&#146;s television screens. It is six months since the Camp David process broke down, and the Palestinians turned to demonstrations on the street to plead their cause to the world. In that time the casualties have been high: 375 Palestinians, 63 Israeli Jews and 19 others killed by the beginning of April. The wounded and injured number thousands. For those who are not familiar with the geography of Israel, the small distances involved are always a surprise. The West Bank covers less than 6000 sq km and the Gaza Strip adds another 1000 sq km out of Israel making a total land area of about one third the size of Wales. The mixing of Israeli settlements with arab towns in these small territories is a constant reminder of the Palestinians&#146; occupied status. Protecting the settlers puts the Israeli forces in daily contact with Palestinians going about their business. In a period of mutual suspicion and hostility, the divides between the two peoples are deepened.<br>
			<br>
			Israelis feel threatened by some of their Arab neighbours and by the Palestinian population within. Since the start of the uprising last autumn, the Israeli government has reacted with increasing force. The techniques of the Israel military  against external aggressors has always been speedy response to any attack with the use of overwhelming force. The recent attacks on Syria and Lebanon are part of this Israeli doctrine. This has been a strategy  of deterrence by punishment: the leadership of a potential aggressor is made to feel certain that he will lose more than he will gain. The extension of this philosophy into internal security operations is less useful. There is a wealth of historical evidence to show that heavy-handed internal repression increases the internal security problem rather than cures it. The use of overwhelming force (such as helicopter gunships against small arms) in the narrow confines of Arab towns inevitably causes casualties to innocent bystanders. The families of the dead and injured become the next generation of freedom fighters, and the peace seekers are weakened. This effect can take a generation to change.<br>
			<br>
			So whatever the rights or wrongs of the various claims, Israel is building itself a long term security problem. Yasser Arafat is scarcely a model democrat, but previous Israeli governments have invested a great deal of political effort in establishing sound negotiations for a future settlement with him. Arafat&#146;s freedom of action is constrained by political support; and current Israeli tactics make it more difficult for him to give way. The closure of frontiers, the bulldozing of farms and houses, the government sponsored assassinations, the shooting of young protesters, the suspension of trade and the aggressive policing are all building a deep and long term resentment among the Palestinians. <br>
			<br>
			The US Congress has entered the debate with nearly 300 members calling on President Bush to close the PLO office and to cut economic assistance to the Palestinians. There is also talk of a ban on travel by Palestinian officials to the USA. This will be taken by the Palestinians as another example of US bias towards Israel. Further economic pressure will increase the unemployment in the West Bank and in Gaza. The jobless will swell the numbers of demonstrators.<br>
			<br>
			At this stage, calls by the US and Israel for Yasser Arafat to order the Palestinians off the streets are unrealistic. It would mean that his people had to accept continued building of settlements on their land, and the military occupation arrangements that go with these settlements. The parties need urgently to get back to the formal negotiating table. The long term security of Israel depends on achieving a co-operative arrangement with all its neighbours. It is possible as the security arrangements in recent years with Jordan have shown. The benefits to Israelis and Palestinians would be enormous if they could work together. Israel must be feeling economically pressurised by the collapse of tourism, the cost of using reservists and the loss of trade. It is certainly feeling less secure from both internal terrorist threats and also from Iraq stirring up trouble. <br>
			<br>
			With Sharon cast in the role of Goliath to Arafat&#146;s David, the time is running out for the grand gesture. However a proposal for stopping building and then progressively reducing the settlements might be a worthwhile trade for peace. The US cannot be expected to play the honest broker any more. It might be time for the new more confident EU to step in. It has both sticks and carrots on offer for both parties. A threat of an EU boycott of Israeli goods would be politically difficult, but there is a case for making Ariel Sharon realise that his current approach to internal policing is internationally unacceptable. The EU has no lack of funding pressure that it can bring to bear on the Palestinian Authority to ensure that they also make the necessary moves towards peace. Unless the international community acts soon, the long term outlook is very bleak. Starting to take on Syria and Lebanon may make a more widespread conflict even more likely.   </p>
