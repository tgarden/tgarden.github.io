			<h3>Bring Back the Press Gang?</h3>

			<p>The foreign policy ambitions of the Labour Government make &quot;punching above our weight&quot; something of an understatement. To carry out the tasks set by Tony Blair in his series of speeches on international responsibilities, the British military find themselves deployed around the world. The trained strength of the British army is now slightly under 100,000 troops. The US Marine Corps alone can field 135,000 ground troops and has an aviation force of another 36,000 people.  The Japanese Ground Self-Defence force is almost 150,000 regular soldiers. Japan is unenthusiastic about overseas operations but feels the need to sustain an army that is half as big again as the UK. The USA, which is a global player sees the need for even its specialist Marine ground troop force to be larger than  the British army. <br>
				<br>
				On 11 April, the House of Commons held a serious, but little reported debate, on armed forces personnel.  The issues to be covered were scarcely new, but the concerns from all benches seemed to be more focused than usual. The current shortfalls in personnel levels add up to nearly 10,000 across the three Services. The army is 7500 below its trained requirement. Specialist areas are particularly difficult. Both the RN and the RAF have had to take painful frontline cuts to manage their pilot shortage problems.  <br>
				<br>
				MPs also spent some time on the parlous state of the Defence Medical Services. The problem in the medical area dates from the Defence Review conducted by Malcolm Rifkind in the mid 1990s. The dedicated military hospitals were seen then as unnecessary extra support costs. It was also seen as efficient to transfer routine health activities from expensive military medical services to the NHS. This decision has proved to be one of the most disastrous of the recent past. In a time when every member of the armed forces needs to be fit for action, many are unfit for medical reasons, and awaiting treatment. Families feel that they lack medical support from their military unit (although this support has been marginal for many years). Most importantly of all, the UK with its wish to take on challenging operations around the world, finds itself unable to deploy adequate medical support to deal with casualties. Just as shortage of pilots and cash have led to the decision to depend on US air power to defend the fleet between 2006 and 2012, so we find British troops dependent on a Czech field hospital for operations in Afghanistan. If the worst comes to the worst and we sustain badly injured casualties, the specialists in burns, explosive injuries, and rebuilding battle damaged bodies will not be available in the NHS. The military medical services, both regular and reserve, in the UK have almost no hope of being rebuilt within a decade, regardless of the money which might be allocated.<br>
				<br>
				Less obvious has been the marked decline in Territorial Army strength over the past 5 years. The Strategic Defence Review of 1998 called for a reduction of the TA from around 55,000 down to 40,000, with their role being to provide specialist reinforcements for expeditionary operations. The parliamentary debate revealed that even this new lower target was failing to be maintained, and that the TA is currently 1300 short. It is widely expected that the MOD's look at defence policy in the light of the 11 September attacks will include recommendations that the Reserves take on a greater role in counter-terrorist home defence. This will make even fewer Reserves available to fill in the gaps for  the regular forces, which are feeling the combined strain of personnel shortages and increased commitments.<br>
				<br>
				In the debate, Bruce George, Chairman of the Defence Select Committee, dropped a hint that his committee may be proposing a rise in defence spending to 3% of GDP (from its current figure of 2.3%). It is unlikely that Gordon Brown will be underwriting such a massive change in his spending review calculations. MPs from all parties were warm in their words about the achievements of UK armed forces. There was also a measure of agreement about the need to improve conditions for service families. Retention of people in the Service was the key issue; recruiting is relatively buoyant, but the turnover is very wasteful. <br>
				<br>
				The demands on the forces continue. Afghanistan is proving more intractable, and the UK contribution to the stabilisation force has been extended yet again. The other British force of Marines engaged in search and destroy missions will be ready for action next week. Tony Blair is ready to provide monitors in Israel if the call comes; and hanging over everyone is the prospect of a major war in Iraq within the next twelve months. We shall have to hope that the limits of British capability are not found in the coming days. Little that was said from Ministers gave much hope that the personnel issues were going to be solved in the near term. Perhaps we will need to return to the Press Gang in order to maintain the forces for the Government's aspirations for influence around the world.<br>
