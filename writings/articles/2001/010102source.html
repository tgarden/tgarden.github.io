FCO?</FONT></CENTER></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">As FCO officials return to their offices
after the long Christmas break, there will be no lack of issues for
the New Year. Two elections will dominate their assessments. The
first has finally stumbled to a conclusion: George W Bush will be
setting the transatlantic agenda. The date of the second has still to
be announced: the timing of the UK General Election will affect both
foreign policy and its implementation. Europe is bound to be a major
issue in the British election, and this will make Ministers less
willing to take controversial steps. There are also enough unresolved
and emerging problems around the world to ensure that there will be
some unpleasant surprises during the year.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Brainwashed by CNN, many US citizens believe
that the world's trouble spots are exclusively patrolled by
Americans. We sometimes suffer from similar delusions in Britain
about our own forces. The new Bush administration is likely to seek a
reduction to this burden. They may start with a timetable for full
withdrawal of US forces in the Balkans This will be the first of a
number of issues that may rattle the transatlantic
relationship.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Warning US shots across the bows of the
European Union defence project have been sounding since the Nice
summit.  America will not wish to risk its leadership role in
European security. NATO remains their key institution for ensuring
that Europe does not wander too far from the US security agenda. The
European capability which is developing out of the headline goals
agreed by EU states at Helsinki in December 1999 will be a policy
issue for the new Bush administration. This may give Tony Blair some
headaches in a run up to his election.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">One other NATO issue will be a source for
transatlantic tension: the next stage of enlargement.. With EU
enlargement receiving a slightly cloudy green light at the Nice
summit, the parallel NATO process is likely to become an issue for
this year. Romania and Slovenia are left over business from 1999.
There is a strategic argument for filling in some of the gaps on the
NATO map, which would include Slovakia and Bulgaria. However, the
Baltic States will be an issue to be resolved. The Bush
administration will not wish to defer to Russian sensitivities, and
may want to include some or all of  Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in
the next tranche of NATO enlargement. This may not be the way some
European states see the future security of the region being best
served.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	A more confrontational approach to Russia
may also develop over the proposed National Missile Defence system.
The Bush administration is deeply committed to moving forward with
the NMD project. They are prepared to exercise their right to
withdraw from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty if the Russians will
not agree a suitable amendment to it. Some European governments have
already indicated their opposition to  NMD. The UK has a direct part
to play in any future missile defence architecture. The early warning
radar at Fylingdales will need to be rebuilt to house a large radar
array in direct contravention of the ABM treaty as currently written.
Should it allow the necessary installations as part of the special
relationship with the US; while accepting that this might put the UK
at risk of preemptive attack? Or should it adopt a position in common
with its EU colleagues which recognises the  adverse impact of US NMD
on European security; while accepting that it will lose significant
clout with the US as a result? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">One region which is certain to cause
difficulties is Israel and its neighbours. Again, the change of US
Presidency is important. Clinton has worked hard to find common
ground between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Bush will have
other early priorities, and there is an Israeli election to confuse
the issue further. Nor does Europe take the same view as the US about
the rights of each side. It may be that the region will become the
focus for much greater violence in the coming year if no settlement
can be agreed. It would not be a rerun of the Gulf War of ten years
ago - the Arab neighbours would side with the Palestinians, while the
US (probably without the support of Europe) came to the defence of
Israel. This would make for a very dangerous international
situation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">There are plenty of other potential trouble
spots for 2001: Taiwan, Indonesia, Columbia, Korea, the Indian
subcontinent and many regions of Africa. Perhaps, the one bright spot
is the reduced risk of further conflict in the Balkans. Provided 
that the hard slog of post-conflict rebuilding of the economy and
society continues, there is real hope for a brighter future in the
much longer term.  Russia will continue to need careful attention,
and increasingly China will have to be reckoned with. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Even in the peaceful area of Europe, foreign
policy will be beset by challenges. Monetary Union will be the most
difficult policy area in an election year, yet the Labour Government
will wish to make progress if only to retain influence in the EU.
Although at this stage it seems improbable that the British election
will bring a Conservative government into being, that really could
bring about some policy crises over Europe. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">All in all, 2001 will be a busy year for the
Foreign Secretary and FCO officials. Trying to keep the special
relationship with the US alive will be particularly difficult, and
there may be real choices to be made between loyalty to Washington or
to Brussels.</FONT></P>
