<P>Chatham House 2000</P>

<P>International Affairs in a new era</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>A new era?</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Just over 6 months into my time as Director I want to use my short
time this evening to share some thoughts on the challenges that face
Chatham House over the next few years, and the strategy that I see as
being necessary. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I am not sure that forecasting and futurology has ever had great
success. One can always point to the isolated case of a successful
prophet in retrospect, but it seems to be uniformally difficult to
identify which are the accurate predictions in advance of events. 
That does mean that all trend analysis is doomed, and we are
certainly in a position to identify many new trends in international
affairs. The world is different after the end of the Cold War;
concepts of power are also changing with the internationalisation of
financial markets and world trade. Data and software, which are no
more than the ordering of binary sequences, have become tradable
commodities like coal and iron in the past. Yet they can be passed
instantaneously around the world with ease outside the control of
states. Governments' future powers to raise taxes begin to look less
assured. Regional groupings and supra-national regulatory bodies vie
with non-governmental organisations to share power and influence with
national governments. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>At the same time the expectation of individuals is changing. Less
economic security, more mobility of labour, a need for technical
expertise, access to worldwide information in an easily absorbed
format, the disappearance of deference to authority, and radical
changes to the social norms of the past.  </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>These trends on the international scene and at the personal level
are already having a profound affect at every level. This Institute
is affected by both the changes in the international scene and by the
changing expectations of its audience.  I shall describe how I see
the Institute developing to meet these challenges. But let me start
by briefly describing where we are now.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>First Impressions</P>

<P>Perhaps I can spend a few moments telling you of the excitement of
my first few months in post as I discovered the secrets of the House.
On the travels that I have undertaken in these first few months to
Europe, to the United States and to Japan, the reputation of the
Institute as a world leader has been brought home to me time and time
again.  Most of you will know well the excellence of the work in the
fields in which you have a particular interest. Few will have a
picture of the totality of the activities that stem from the
existence of the Institute. We have, as you all know, a number of
different roles housed within a single Institute.  </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Membership </P>

<P>First we are a membership organisation. The membership is drawn
from individuals and from corporate nominees and has a very broad
range of those with an interest and expertise in International
Affairs. In background, we have politicians, businessmen, bankers,
journalists, academics, diplomats, government officials, writers,
military people, consultants, students, and every profession and
business that needs to be aware of what is going on in the wider
world. Such a range of backgrounds, and such a broad remit as our
charter, gives me my first problem: the question of priorities. To
many Members, the meetings programme is at the heart of their
involvement. I belong to a number of Institutes, but none comes
anywhere near Chatham House in frequency, spread or speakers.  Even
so, difficult decisions are needed on how to balance this programme
to meet the needs of members, and to ensure that we are bringing key
issues to the fore in a timely way.  The meetings as you are all
aware are at their most valuable when the expertise in the audience
is stimulated to debate the ideas of the speaker. Yet if we focus too
much on the fashionable issues of the day, we may squeeze out
important issues, which have not yet become so widely understood. The
meetings also need to be able to help develop both global
understanding of issues, and also contribute towards policy
development. The traditional 30 minutes of talk followed by 30
minutes of discussion is widely used - as we are doing tonight.
However, debates, panels and less formal arrangements have a place. 
Members also benefit from the publications, journals, the library,
and involvement in the second major aspect of the Institute: its
research activities.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Research</P>

<P>The scale of the research effort was something which I had not
fully comprehended before I arrived. Many of you will have dealt with
research programme staff in your field of interest. When you combine
each of the major programme areas of Europe, the Middle East, Energy
&amp; Environment, International Economics, Security, Asia-Pacific,
and Russia-Eurasia, the scenario development in CH Forum, and the
many smaller research groups, some of which are in house and others
out-sourced, we have  an unparalleled asset. Some indication of the
output of the research comes from the publications. Again the scale
of this output is breathtaking. Typically we will publish 50
publications in a year with the Chatham House imprint on top of the
two journals. International Affairs is an essential source for any
serious commentator. Its ranking in the academic citation ratings
proves this year after year. Yet some  members find that time is ever
pressing and they would wish to be able to take the excellence of the
research on trust and read the distilled wisdom in shorter form. The
World Today has responded to this need and is providing topical and
exciting comment on issues of the day. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Finance</P>

<P>So can I spend my time as Director confident that no more is
needed than a gentle hand on the tiller of this great institution as
it continues on its long held course? I think you would be surprised
if I were to suggest that I could. There are many reasons why the
Institute cannot rest on its past glories. It is not my intention to
talk much today about the financial aspects of the operation here.
This is a more appropriate topic for the AGM in September. I must
however address the subject briefly, because it has a significant
effect on how we plan a strategy for the years ahead, and how well we
can respond to the needs of you, our members.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P> Funds for the Institute's activities come from many sources.
Membership subscriptions both individual and corporate are
particularly important as a regular income to support all operations
across the House. We are of course an elite membership, drawn from
those with a particular interest in International Affairs, and from
Companies who understand the importance of our work to their own long
term success. Our membership is therefore limited in number and is
unlikely to grow rapidly, unless the nature of the membership 
changes. Perhaps this is a question that we can come back to in
discussion. Funding also comes from generous benefactions, but these
have been a changing source in recent years: more directed towards
specific projects than the general work of the House. Our
independence from government is of course financial independence as
well as intellectual.</P>

<P>For the Research programmes, the excellence of the work attracts
substantial support from a very wide range of foundation and
corporate supporters. Keeping the balance right between the overall
research programme and the pull of the sponsors is a problem not
unique to Chatham House.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Marketing</P>

<P>But we also have opportunities to market various aspects of our
activities to be able to generate funds to support our wider aims. A
particularly successful aspect of this has been our specialist
commercial conferences, where we can draw on the expertise of the
research staff to provide unique conferences, which appeal to a
specialist markets.  I know that the prices for these events often
surprise individual members, but do remember they not only allow us
to bring together great expertise on relevant and topical issues, but
they also supplement our income to the benefit of all the membership.
Other commercial activities such as letting out function rooms to
outside organisations make sure that we reduce the overhead costs of
supporting this grand listed building.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Deficit</P>

<P> Despite all this good work, I know that many of you will be aware
that the Institute has for some years been living off its capital in
order to make ends meet. This has two bad effects: firstly it means
that it is much more difficult to embark on new ventures. The need to
guarantee external funding ahead of any new project is bound to lead
to a more conventional and perhaps limited programme of activities.
While the research that we do is at the cutting edge, the totality of
it is not necessarily comprehensive in terms of the demands of the
future. The second rather less high flown reason for needing to
eliminate the operating deficit is that ultimately any organisation
that does not balance the books is destined for the scrap heap.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>As I said, I do not wish to spend long on the financial position.
As those of you who use the Institute, or read the newsletter, will
be aware, we are in the midst of a restructuring exercise with tight
financial targets, which is designed to put us in operating surplus
within 3 years. This is achievable, but with some difficulty, and it
will be important that we match the strategy for the Institute that I
want to offer you, with the financial position of the House.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Strategy</P>

<P>So let me turn now to the strategy for the new century. What are
the important issues ahead of us in the World, what can Chatham House
 contribute to its membership, to Britain,  to Europe and to the
international community as a whole? And secondly how should it
deliver its output to the membership and the wider world? The Council
working party which was formed last summer, spend a considerable time
consulting and developing a view of the mission of Chatham House.
They decided that the Charter was shown to have stood the test of
time and that the mission is still relevant and appropriate. We are
unique in our scope, and we have well proven ways of developing ideas
on key issues so that we can inform the debate amongst the decision
makers within  government and outside it. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Impartial and Independent</P>

<P>We have preserved our independence and impartiality as an
Institution, at a time when others have followed the fashion of the
day. This carefully preserved independence, a requirement of the
Charter, is of course not without its drawbacks in the short term. If
the Institute were to declare a position on EMU, or on NATO
enlargement, or on the rights and wrong of the Middle East, we could
doubtless gain the headlines in the way that other institutes do. The
more difficult path of remaining an impartial neutral Chatham House
is however ultimately much more rewarding. The quality of debate and
discussion is higher, the range of views more diverse, and the
answers to questions of the day are more likely to be found by
participants. So my first marker for the future strategy is the
preservation of the Institute's reputation as impartial and as a
platform for all views. This means that we may from time to time
annoy some of our supporters, when we give a platform to those with
radically different viewpoints.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Continuing Relevance</P>

<P>The next question is whether the activities that we undertake
today are right for tomorrow, firstly in nature and secondly in
content. This is a much more difficult aspect to address. Has our
Research some value that is not achievable elsewhere? Do our
publications inform the debate, or gather dust in libraries around
the world; are our meetings the elites speaking to the elites without
radical thinking? Are the problems that we examine, the key issues of
International Affairs for the next decade? I put the questions as
provocatively as this, because I believe all great institutions do
need from time to time ask themselves what they are doing, and
whether they do it out of habit rather than thinking where they are
going. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In order to give my answer to these questions, let me first put on
the table some personal views of the topics, which  seem likely to be
important in the coming years. Of course in any such analysis, time
scales are important. In the short term we may worry about the
policies of a particular government in a particular region, in the
medium term, we need to think how regions may develop economically
and politically. For the longer term, we need to look at the major
impact that mankind is having on the planet in terms of pollution,
environment, sustainable development and the consumption of both
renewable and finite resources. We are an institute of international
affairs, and we must therefore be careful not to become too
parochial. It is all too easy to grade issues by distance from
London. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Government Strategic Review</P>

<P>I was delighted to be involved in the seminar held by the Foreign
Secretary and the Defence Secretary at the start of the Strategic
Defence Review process a couple of weeks ago. It was clear that for
the planners, the most difficult issue is the uncertainty of the
future international scene. While that is a difficulty for Whitehall
planners, it is of course a rationale for yet greater efforts from an
Institute like Chatham House. We must be able to provide the
expertise and analysis for these future uncertain issues.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Future World Trends</P>

<P>So let me take you for a whistle stop tour around the world -
remembering that our remit from the charter is the study of
international politics, international economics and international
jurisprudence. Where do we need to focus our efforts? If we start in
Europe, there will be plenty of issues to keep us going well into the
next century. Beyond monetary union and the first stage of NATO  and
EU enlargement, there will be the key questions about the future of
the European Union and a particular interest from here about the role
that Britain will play. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>With my background, I am of course particularly interested in how
we can extend and deepen the security of Europe, without putting at
risk all that has been achieved so far. If we are to learn one thing
from the recent turmoil over the first tranche of NATO enlargement,
it is that Institutes like Chatham House have a key role on trying to
lift both public and political awareness early enough for options to
be debated, before decisions have to be taken. Again we can take
Bosnia and Albania as  examples of how important it is to keep
thinking developing on ethnic and regional problems within Europe. 
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Geographical</P>

<P>Any analysis of the future for Europe will need to be based on a
good knowledge of what is going on in Russia, and this region will
remain a key area of interest to us. We will need to keep our strong
research base, and use it to monitor and inform policymakers on how
successful Europe is being in the engagement and development of
Russia. The Middle East and North Africa will continue to provide a
range of security, population, economic, and cultural issues for us
to grapple with. Again there will be both near term issues, but also
longer term analysis required in ensuring a growth of stability in
the region. Nor must we forget the rest of Africa where we need to be
developing expertise in a region which continues to provide a
succession of difficult political, ethical and economic problems.
China will loom ever larger in our work - it is already a central
feature, and the Asia Pacific region will continue to require
research in respect of its economic and political development and
there remain a number of possible security issues. Our close
connections with Japan are a great strength in this respect. The
Indian sub-continent has perhaps attracted less attention than should
be the case, and we will need to build up our analysis capability for
this region. The same is I believe true for the Americas. There is
much to learn from the changes in South America, and it is a region
with which we have great links. Nor must we forget the importance of
working on every aspect of international affairs as seen from the
United States. The future involvement of the US is a key factor in
virtually every issue that we examine, and we must have analysis to
draw upon.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Organisational</P>

<P>It is not just regional expertise that we need to draw upon, we
must also look at organisation and institutions. The United Nations,
ASEAN, EU, NATO, OSCE, OAU, the Commonwealth, Mercosur, NAFTA, WTO,
IMF, the list goes on and on, and all have important roles to play
that we must understand, perhaps influence and certainly inform. NGOs
are increasingly important in the contribution that they make to
international affairs.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Issues and themes</P>

<P>Overlaying this geographical and organisational spread of tasks,
which effectively confirm that all the regions of the world will
continue to be of importance to our work, is the mix of issues that
we must cover. Economics, politics, law and security will continue to
be the key aspects of our research, but we must also look at the
other issues that affect the quality of life of future generations,
and are aspects of the international system. I think of such topics
as international crime, human rights abuses, pollution, environmental
degradation, arms control, terrorism, ethnic separation, migration, 
and the range of what are sometimes called the soft security issues.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Need for Research Priorities</P>

<P>In giving such a brief and rapid run around the areas that we must
be in, I am conscious that we currently have great strengths in some,
and a need to do more in others. It will, as in so many things, be a
question of priorities. We will need to review our Research strategy
regularly to ensure that we have our priorities right, and we have
set that work in hand. In this respect. I am looking where we can to
co-operate more with other institutions both in the UK and overseas,
to ensure that we can all benefit from pooled expertise. I also look,
as I know my predecessors have, to the wealth of expertise that is
represented by the membership. We use it greatly now, and I would
want to draw even more on you the members to contribute to our work
in every possible way. Perhaps, I can use this as an excuse to remind
you of the importance of keeping us informed about your latest areas
of interest.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Technology</P>

<P>So let me turn finally to one issue which I have not yet mentioned
in respect of the future work of Chatham House. The issue is that of
technology. It is an issue for us in two different respects: first we
must be able to analyse its impact on all our areas of research
interest. The globalisation of markets, the empowerment of the
individual, the division between the technology haves and have-nots
(both within nations and between nations), information warfare, and
the multitude of ways that international relations are already
changing as the technologies change the nature of commerce, politics,
security and perhaps even democracy; all of these are key issues for
us as we enter the next millennia. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Communication</P>

<P>But the technological developments also have implications for the
way that we do our business. Computing power is affecting us all:
desktop publishing allows to target our audiences so that our message
is delivered in a form that does not gather dust on a shelf. Multiple
ISDN lines allow to reach radio and television broadcasting standards
to ensure that we can provide instantaneous expert comment to the
world through the ever-expanding digital broadcasting channels. The
internet is moving from the specialist to the consumer - just as
computers themselves have done. Ten years ago internet users were
numbered in the few thousands in academia and defence. Today some 57
million people have full internet access, with another 14 million on
e-mail, covering 194 countries. The internet must be a key medium for
the conduct of our business given its global nature. Most are aware
of the World Wide Web given the way it has matured so quickly over
the past 3 years. The HTML standards allow us to publish in
attractive ways to a global audience at virtually no cost, and it can
be seen by anyone with any computer and modem. If you have not
experienced what is already on offer at www.riia.org then have a look
upstairs. We are already providing briefing papers to the world. I
realise that many of our members are not wired, but like the phone,
the day is coming when it will be a normal communication device. When
we have a membership that is wired, we can go much further in the
services we currently provide by post. E-mail is both cheaper and
quicker, and we can keep everyone up to date with their special
interest. Discussion groups along the lines of moderated news groups
also offer the potential for key issues to be debated around the
world. I know that I may have lost a number of my audience with this
last pitch on the excitement of what is already possible, but I
believe that we can exploit the new communication system much more to
ensure that we meets the needs of the membership and our mission to
enlighten.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Conclusion - Priorities</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In summary, we have an Institute without parallel in terms of its
activities and its potential. But like any other Institute, the world
does not owe it a living, and we have a sound strategy to ensure a
secure financial base into the future, so that we can develop our
activities and readjust our priorities in a timely fashion, and we
shall use the new, and the old,  technologies to ensure that our
message reaches the target audience and can influence events.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>A final list of priorities for my time as Director would read:
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	1.	Maintaining the reputation of the Institute for 			high
quality 	output in all its activities.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	2.	Maintaining the independence and impartiality 			of the
House.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	3.	Ensuring that we operate from a sound financial 		base
so that we can:</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	4.	Have a research strategy which gives us the 			coverage
to identify, analyse and inform the debate 			on the key issues
of tomorrow which will be relevant 		to our corporate members, our
individual members 			and the wider requirements of the charter.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	5.	Exploit the new opportunities which the 				explosion
in worldwide communication is offering us, 		to involve the
international community and give more		effective distribution of
our work.</P>
