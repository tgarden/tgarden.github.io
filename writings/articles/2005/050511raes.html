			<h3>Past Experience &amp; Future Need&nbsp;</h3>
			<p>I am delighted to be here to open this important conference. It is now 16 years since wrote a book called The Technology Trap in which I discussed where technological developments were likely to be of greatest service to the military. I argued then that simulation was the answer to many of our resource and training problems, and that it offered the prospect of developing new solutions to our problems. I have to say that progress has been slower than I had hoped, and as we discuss the various contributions to this important conference, we will need to sort the dreams from the realities.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>My own practical knowledge is drawn from the dark ages of simulation. Starting with the Link trainer, the army telephone battles at Camberley and I suppose low tech TEWTs, being tested in the Vulcan full crew combat trainer &#150; state of the art analogue computing - finally doing Chinook and Puma exciting emergencies that could only be practised in the simulator. For those that have seen Crisis Command, that was another form of simulation. I think the one lesson that I would take from all of these, is that the human brain is remarkably good at filling in the gaps. Simulation can be very real, even without the most modern high resolution graphics. Hovering with automatics off in a Chinook simulator can feel pretty real even if the visual clues are a few rough pixels on the screen.</p>
			<p>What do we expect from modern defence simulation? Training, evaluation, doctrine development, real-time operational options. As we move towards more network enabled capabilities, will simulation and operations merge in terms of systems? The only difference being whether weapons are fired.</p>
			<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
			<h3><b>Strategic Context</b></h3>
			<p>The UK context is one where we currently plan on the basis that we only fight future big wars alongside the US. We see non state actors as much more important than we did, and the military is also much more involved in stabilisation than once it was. Network enabled capabilities are perhaps much more easily built into a simulation facility. We are all aware of the extraordinary disparity between US Defense research and development budgets and those of any other nation. Yet the US needs allies to operate alongside it, if only for political rather than capability reasons. I think this is going to lead to an interesting technological problem which will affect simulation as well as actual weapon systems. European countries continue to suffer from an ever widening gap in terms of development of next generation systems. The costs of keeping up continue to multiply. Yet if we cannot plug in to the US systems, then it will be very difficult to be more than allies in rhetoric. This may mean that it will be in US national interests to ensure that we can be full players in their developments in simulation.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Even with a helpful US, which is by no means a given, the big problem for the UK looking forward will be resources. There has in the past been a&nbsp; tendency to economise on simulator procurement when weapon systems come under cost cutting pressure. Getting the balance of investment right is difficult. As we move to yet fewer platforms, the apparent overhead cost of simulators appears proportionately larger. Yet of course simulation may preserve the smaller number of weapon systems for longer.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>One other aspect of the new strategic context is the complexity of tasks which we expect the military to undertake. The use of quite simple simulation for pre-Northern Ireland training for soldiers gives us some indication of its relevance. Whether enough thinking is going into simulation training at every level for post conflict and stabilisation tasks, I leave to the experts to discuss.</p>

			<h3><b>Advantages</b></h3>
			<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
			<p><i>Environmental</i></p>
			<p>Let me turn to the a quick look at some of the factors which may affect priority for investment in all forms of simulation in the coming years. When it comes to simulation which replaces operational training, the environmental impact will be a telling argument. In the past, many have argued for greater flying simulation to reduce low flying noise. Now, the argument will be much more about reducing the carbon bill from military flying, and other hydrocarbon burning military activities. It is not impossible that we will see procurement projects weighing the cost and environmental impact in a new balance which will weigh more towards investment in simulation.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><i>Operating Costs</i></p>
			<p>The new awareness of through life costs for systems should help make the case for more training taking place through simulation. As fuel costs rise, this will become even more the case. I am not sure what assumptions are made these days about future aviation fuel costs as we procure Eurofighter and JSF for service lives towards perhaps 2040. Indeed, if those who argue that we are in the latter days of the oil economy are right, then it may be that simulation becomes the only peacetime option, with fuel held in reserve for operations.</p>
			<p><i>Safety</i></p>
			<p>The use of simulation to train for emergency situations without putting crew or aircraft at real risk remains an important role. As we move towards greater use of unmanned systems, there will also be a growing need for free airspace without cvil flight safety inhibitions. The crowded skies are likely to make this yet more difficult, and again the push will be towards greater use of simulation.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><i>Testing</i></p>
			<p>While doctrine changed little during the years of the Cold War, we now see much more innovation both because the military tasks are changing, but also because the technology offers so many choices. Simulation offers the prospect of testing these options in a realistic way, but also carries a trap which I shall turn to now as I look at some of the factors which will inhibit the moves towards greater use of advanced simulation.</p>
			<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
			<h3><b>Problems</b></h3>
			<p><i>GIGO</i></p>
			<p>In the early days of computing, it was fashionable to talk about GIGO &#150; Garbage In Garbage Out. As I was preparing these remarks, I looked the acronym up to find out why it had fallen out of use, and learned that it has taken on a new meaning: Garbage in Gospel out. The sense that if a computer tells you something, then it must be true. This it seems to me remains one of the concerns about ever greater use of simulation in training and evaluating in military operations. How do we make sure that we are not building in our own prejudices and assumptions. The real world is disjointed and unpredictable because human beings do crazy things &#150; some good and some bad. I will not dwell on this any longer, as it takes us down routes of the limits of consciousness in artificial intelligence. I merely remind you that we need to be careful ot to build in our own vulnerabilities.</p>
			<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
			<p><i>Capital Costs</i></p>
			<p>Having argued that simulation can be argued from savings in operating costs, I must also argue that the imperfect world of cash flow and annual budgets means that capital costs (even in a RAB world) can cause delays, scaling down and lack of enthusiasm for simulation elements of defence programmes. How often do we hear the cry that we can use the real thing if the simulator is late. It did not of course quite work out that way with the Apache programme.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><i>Technology trap</i>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Simulators, just like weapon systems, suffer from what I have called in the past the technology trap. Advocates talk up the technology and promise that it will do more, cost less and arrive earlier than proves to be the case.</p>
			<p><i>&nbsp;Customer confidence</i></p>
			<p><i>&nbsp;</i>Finally there is the question of customer confidence in simulation. I am sure many of you will remember back in the dark ages the sinking feeling of the simulator slot. Pitting your wits against crusty old instructors who could fail critical systems at just the wrong moment. There was none of the joy of flying. Maybe a generation brought up on computer games feel differently now, but I doubt it. The high level decision makers are still attached to&nbsp; real world training. Perhaps we need to invest more in simulation and training in making those high level procurement decisions. How often do real ministers take part in crisis management exercises?</p>
			<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
			<h3><b>Way Forward</b></h3>
			<p>Like all conference opening addresses, I have posed more questions than I have answered. That is probably just as well. If I could provide all the answers in 15 minutes, then you would not need 2 days to delve into the detail. Simulation covers a vast range of capabilities and requirements. We may be moving from it being the training aid to be within the decision loop. How that will affect operations is key. There is no doubt that the greater integration of network enabled capabilities will make simulation both more important and more a part of the normal operating method. How we stay up with our US allies will be a real problem. For me the answer must be through greater European/NATO cost sharing. But I realise the political difficulty in going down this path. We must exploit simulation to test the boundaries of the envelope, train and assess, and get leadership involved.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>I congratulate the Royal Aeronautical Society in holding this important conference, and I know that we are in for a stimulating range of presentations.</p>
