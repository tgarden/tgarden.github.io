<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Exploration  methods </H1>

<P> All the information available about a region is studied.
Exploration "targets" are selected by comparison with regions where
deposits have been found or where the geology is believed favourable.
The  possible location of orebodies is constantly modified by
research  and practical experience. Improved understanding of
prospective environments may prompt renewed interest in previously
discarded  areas. Satellite and other remote sensing data enable
regions to be studied and analysed for patterns and structures which
give clues to  mineralisation. For example, infra-red imagery assists
classification of surface rock and indicates vegetation changes which
may be related to underlying mineralisation. It also identifies
geological structures, such as faults and folds, with which ore
deposits may be associated. Mineral rights are secured at this stage.
In most  countries a formal system of granting prospecting licences
exists.  A licence entitles a company to undertake exploration work
over a specified time period in a designated, often very large area.

<H3>Preliminary studies and reconnaissance surveys </H3>

<P>Geophysical and geochemical surveys are conducted over an entire
region, with widely spaced samples or readings, to test the ground
selection. Areas with anomalous results relative to the surroundings
may indicate the presence of mineralisation and merit further
investigation. A geological anomaly produces measurable variations in
properties such as electrical conductivity, magnetism, natural
radioactivity or gravitational effects. Geophysical surveys are often
carried out from light aircraft or helicopters with minimal
environmental impact. In certain wilderness areas flight restrictions
may be imposed during breeding and nesting seasons. Aerial
photographs are taken and together with geological mapping give
important clues to the potential for mineralisation. </P>

<P>Geochemical surveys involve the collection and analysis of water,
stream sediment. soil, vegetation and rock outcrop samples for metal
content. Elevated metal levels may indicate that rocks containing
mineralisation occur in the area. Soil and sediment anomalies have
often been transported from the mineralised area by erosion,
weathering, glaciation or leaching. Computer modelling produces
composite maps of geochemical and geophysical anomalies to define
areas for further exploration. </P>

<H3>The follow up</H3>

<P>Each anomalous area is analysed. Chemical and physical tests are
carried out to confirm an anomaly and identify its cause. This may
last many months, during which strict measures are taken to avoid
disturbing the environment, wildlife and agriculture. The work has
minimal impact, with most surveys carried out on foot or by light
vehicles. Consultations are held with landowners and the local
community to agree access, explain the process and discuss any
concerns Special care is taken gaining access ro ecologically
sensitive areas. </P>

<P>Some anomalies may be caused by man-made structures and unrelated
to mineralisation. Samples and geophysical measurements are taken on
a grid system over the area of interest and the results mapped. These
give information about the size, depth and attitude of a subsurface
deposit and are assessed relative to the geology and topography to
select drill sites. </P>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Target testing/exploratory drilling </H3>

<P>Drilling tests confirm whether the identified anomalies are caused
by underlying mineralisation. A typical programme involves drilling
from two to a dozen small holes over an area of several square miles.
Drilling is usually carried out by contractors and may last a few
weeks to over a year, depending on the nature of the test target. If
results are not encouraging, further work on an entire area may be
abandoned and the surface restored. </P>

<P>Sufficient funds must be available to complete a programme and
undertake drill core analysis. Most companies spend a high proportion
of their exploration budgets on drilling but costs can run into tens
of thousands of dollars for each hole. Selection of the most
promising prospects from a number of porential targets demands
careful cost estimation and comparison. </P>

<H3>Evaluation drilling/pre development</H3>

<P>Evaluation drilling and trenching is carried out to determine the
nature of the mineralised zone. Deposits are often complex so many
samples are needed to establish the grade, size and continuity before
further financial resources are justified. </P>

<P>Trenching and drilling can disturb the environment so measures are
taken to minimise the impact. Water is needed to cool the drill bit
and there is potential for accidental spillages of lubricants or
diesel from machinery. These materials are carefully stored and sumps
are used as oil traps; as much water as possible is re-cycled If the
evaluation is not successful the drill and trench sites are carefully
restored. </P>

<P>Once a deposit is identified exploration comes to an end, although
additional work may continue at any developed mine to establish
further reserves. </P>

<P>A conceptual mining project is prepared so that a preliminary
feasibility study to decide if the deposit can be mined economically
can be undertaken. This includes the size and nature of the mine and
processing plant, with approximate construction costs. Alternative
extraction and processing methods, the potential environmental and
social impacts with proposed protective and mitigatory measures and
closure plans, are all examined. </P>

<P>An Environmental Impact Assesment is carried out as part of the
full feasibility study prior to the decision being taken to proceed
to development. If consent for a mine is grantedby the planning
authorities the prospecting licence is changed to a mining licence.
