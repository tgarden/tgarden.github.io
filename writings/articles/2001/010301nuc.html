		<h4>The Strategic Context</h4>
		<p>In the history of warfare, nuclear weapons are a relatively recent arrival in the armories of nations. It is only 55 years since the first, and last, atomic bombs were used in conflict. The investment in financial and scientific terms that was needed to design and build the first weapons was of a different order of magnitude than earlier weapons development. Even today, when the processes are well understood, producing a nuclear weapon is not a trivial task. The Manhattan Project, which developed the bombs that were subsequently dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, was the product of World War 2. Although the physics of fission had been developed before the war, it was initially the threat of Germany developing an atomic bomb which spurred such investment by the Allies. When it became clear in 1944 that the German programme had failed, there appears to be evidence that the main drive for continuing the project was a fear of the Soviet Union developing nuclear weapons after the War. Whether it was Germany or the Soviet Union that was seen as potential nuclear threat, the reason for the US nuclear program was to deter future attack by a nuclear armed enemy.</p>
		<p>The Cold War period saw a slow growth in the number of nuclear weapon states. The Soviet Union may have started development of its weapon as early as 1942, and it conducted its first successful test on 23 September 1949. Britain had been conducting its own research programme from 1940, but combined with the US programme in 1943. When collaboration ceased in August 1946 because of the McMahon Act, Britain went back to its own development programme and tested its bomb in 1952. France followed in 1960 and China in 1964. Ten years later India conducted what it termed a peaceful nuclear explosion, and did not at that time claim to be a nuclear weapon state.</p>
		<p>Other states were also working on covert nuclear programmes but only a few continued the programme to successful completion. It is now clear that Israel has had a nuclear weapon capability for many years. South Africa had a well advanced programme which was discontinued when the apartheid regime ended. Pakistan is the only other confirmed state with a nuclear weapon capability. Although it was not until May 1998 that India and Pakistan conducted their weapon tests, both had long been known to have nuclear weapon capabilities, which were build up after their war of 1970/71.</p>
		<p>Today we have some 60 years of nuclear weapon development history and just 8 states capable of immediate nuclear weapon attack. Concerns continue about proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. There are many advanced states which have the technical resources to become nuclear armed if they so wished. However, they have decided not to pursue the nuclear path.There are also a number of states which seem to be working towards a nuclear capability, but have not yet achieved it. This paper reviews the reasons behind the different national policies adopted towards development of national nuclear capabilities.</p>

			<h3>The Big Five</h3>
		</div>
		<h4>US Nuclear Thinking</h4>
		<p>When World War II ended, the United States found it prudent to build up a stockpile of atomic bombs. Any potential nuclear weapon state is limited by the time that it takes to produce weapons' grade fissile material. The American stockpile grew, even though there was no strategy in the immediate post-war period for the specific use of nuclear weapons. There was, however, sufficient concern about the future implications of such weapons for the Administration to push hard for the international control of all nuclear activities through the Baruch Plan. By 1948, the arsenal contained 50 atomic bombs, which could be delivered by a total of 32 suitably modified B-29s. While the strategic thinkers, such as Bernard Brodie were announcing the advent of deterrence, the military were absorbing the new weapons into their contingency planning. Atomic bombs were seen as more effective aerial bombardment weapons, which could be employed in future conflicts to reenact the strategic bombing of World War 2 with greater success.<br>
			<br>
			The successful Soviet test in 1949, following the experience of the Berlin blockade, brought more focus to US nuclear strategy. A capacity for massive nuclear retaliation was built up in order to deter an attack by the Soviet nuclear capability. Defence policy had played a significant part in the presidential election campaign of John F. Kennedy. It was inevitable that his coming into office, in January 1961, would be an occasion for a wide scale review of American nuclear strategy. He had dwelt much on the forecast 'missile gap', which echoed the country's new realisation that it was from hence forwards directly vulnerable in war. He quickly made it clear that the policy of deterrence through massive retaliation was to be maintained. His Secretary of Defense, Robert S. McNamara, saw the problem initially as ensuring that the deterrent remained credible, even if the enemy could launch a preemptive attack. In early 1962 , McNamara elaborated how these survivable forces could be used. The single massive attack was one option. They could be used to 'limit damage to ourselves, and our allies, by knocking out the enemy's bases before he has time to launch his second salvos'. A third possible use was as a bargaining weapon to terminate a war. The new policy offered the flexibility to choose from several operational plans, without requiring any specific advance commitment. He emphasised the need to balance nuclear strength with adequate non-nuclear capability. The Cuban missile crisis of October 1962 made the practical application of nuclear strategy an imminent possibility, and reinforced the mutual deterrence between the US and the Soviet Union. Having come so close to a nuclear exchange, it was clear that nuclear weapons were less useful than had been thought.<br>
			<br>
			
			The 1960s and early 1970s were characterised by the political realisation that a nuclear war could not be fought and won. They were also a period of considerable advances in the use of arms control mechanisms to limit the dangers of nuclear war. The two superpowers had signed a series of important bilateral agreements: Hot-line (1963), Nuclear Accidents (1971), Anti-Ballistic Missile (1972), SALT I (1972), SALT II (1979). There were also important multilateral agreements to limit the spread of nuclear weapons, and of these the most important was the Non Proliferation Treaty (NPT)  which came into force in 1970. All of these reflected the emerging understanding that nuclear weapons were not weapons to be used in fighting wars.<br>
			<br>
			
			The deterrent effect of mutual assured destruction must prevent war.  The credibility of a deterrent posture, which could involve the total devastation of the United States of America in the defence of Western Europe, was  questionable. The solution was  to develop some practical options which would save the President from the stark choices of surrender or suicide.  In 1974, Secretary Schlesinger emphasised the need to preserve the ultimate sanction of massive retaliation, invulnerable at all times. However, for lower levels of action, it was essential to have a wide range of target options. These options must include a capability for accurate attacks, with minimum collateral damage. He also stated that the US would avoid any combination of forces which might appear to the USSR to be providing a first strike disarming capability.<br>
			<br>
			
			From the military planning aspect, the new policy gave authority to continue targeting military installations, nuclear forces and urban/industrial centres as before. Technology was providing greater accuracy of weapons, more warheads per missile, less vulnerability, shorter response time and greater quantities of battlefield information available to the commander (in theory). The new weapons, with their rapid retargeting facility, greater accuracy and range of warhead sizes, are well suited to a plan which requires many options.The gradual transition to a formulation of a posture suited to the best outcome should deterrence fail was added to in 1977. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld changed the emphasis of the massive retaliation mission to that of retarding the ability of the USSR to recover from a nuclear exchange and regain the status of a 20th century power more rapidly than the United States. The military capability has steadily increased, from the 50 atomic bombs of 1948 to the 10,000 weapons available in the 1980s for the 40,000 targets of SIOP-56 . The consistent thread throughout the period has been the securing of an invulnerable massive retaliation capability.<br>
			<br>
			In 1983, President Reagan7 announced a new direction in strategic thinking:</p>
		<p><i>What if free people could live secure in the knowledge that their security did not rest upon the threat of instant US retaliation to deter a Soviet attack; we could intercept and destroy strategic ballistic missiles before they reached our own soil or that of our allies?</i></p>
		<p>This desire for a policy based on strategic defence echoed back to McNamara's search for a damage limitation strategy in the early 1960s. However the concept was technically,unrealistic and the defensive system was not deployed.<br>
			<br>
			With the end of the Soviet Union, many thought that the importance of nuclear weapons would decline markedly. Indeed weapon numbers have reduced, missiles have been detargeted, and proposals for deeper reductions are voiced. However, the United States continues to field several thousand warheads, and retains land, sea and air launched nuclear systems. In a reprise of the Reagan strategic defence initiative, the new President, George W.Bush included a national missile defence system as one of his priorities in his inauguration speech of 20 January 2001. Nuclear weapons are no longer seen as sufficient for deterrence of attack by weapons of mass destruction at some time in the future. Active defences against incoming missiles are believed to be necessary to reinforce deterrence.</p>
		<h4>Russian Nuclear Thinking</h4>
		<p>The Soviet reaction to the Baruch Plan for the international control of atomic weapons in 1946 ensured that it would fail. Stalin saw the turmoil at the end of World War II as an opportunity for expanding the Communist empire. The forces of the United States and Western Europe had been massively demobilised, while the Soviet forces had not. Stalin's major test of the resolve of the West was the Berlin Blockade in 1948. That he chose not to use his superior conventional strength and tactical position suggests a concern for nuclear vulnerability. He was not prepared to risk a full scale conflict with a United States which could use nuclear weapons with impunity. The large conventional forces must be kept in being while the nuclear capability was developed.<br>
			<br>
			By 1955, Nikita Khrushchev had emerged as the major figure of the Soviet leadership. At the same time, they were at last gaining a strategic nuclear capability, which, however inferior,they were prepared to brandish. Bulganin told Eden of Britain's vulnerability to attack using 'rocket technique' should Britain continue the Suez operation. While the British may not have taken this threat seriously in 1956, the launch of Sputnik the following year made the world realise the new strategic capabilities of the Soviet Union. Khrushchev made it clear that he considered the nuclear strategic missile to be the cornerstone of his military policy. In 1960, he proposed reducing the armed forces by 1,200,000 men and disposing of military aviation and surface ships. The strategic rocket forces would make the current structure unnecessary.</p>
		<p>Following the fall of Khrushchev in 1964, the military view of the need for strong conventional forces coupled with strong nuclear forces prevailed. It is evident that achieving parity with the United States was the first priority. By the start of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) in Helsinki in late 1969, the Soviet Union had agreed with the United States on the existence of and the need to preserve parity, mutual deterrence and strategic stability. In fact, because of delays to the SALT process as a result of the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, when the agreement was made the numbers of launchers permitted gave the Soviets a numerical superiority in this area. The agreements to arms limitations did not mean that the Soviets accepted the American concept of mutual assured destruction. The Soviet military writings, the political statements and the force structure all appear to be internally consistent with the view that nuclear weapons are seen as an essential part of the preparations for war.<br>
			<br>
			
			The Soviet view of deterrence was significantly different from the American one. It is usually described as 'deterrence by denial', rather than the West's doctrine of deterrence by punishment. The demonstrated capability and willingness to fight a nuclear war, and hence deny a victory to the enemy, acts as the deterrent to aggression. The force posture and doctrine for nuclear warfighting did not mean that the Soviets believed that they could use nuclear war as an instrument of policy, or could win, in any meaningful sense, an all out nuclear war. The Soviet strategy differed from the American in how nuclear war was likely to be conducted, should deterrence fail.The early use of decisive fire-power is basic to the doctrine; and the relatively high dependence on vulnerable land-based ICBMs suggests that they would be used in a first strike, or in a launch on warning role. <br>
			<br>
			The American proposals of 1983 of a change of strategy to strategic defence was unwelcome to the Soviet leadership:</p>
		<p><i>Should this conception be converted into reality, this would actually open the floodgates of a runaway race of all types of strategic arms, both offensive and defensive.Such is the real purport, the seamy side, so to say, of Washington's 'Defensive conception'.(Y. Andropov)</i></p>
		<p>It is argued by some analysts that the end of the Soviet Union was brought about by the economic effects of trying to match the Reagan defence strategy. The new Russian government under President Yeltsin matched US moves on reducing numbers and detargeting missiles. Russia has an economic imperative to reduce defence spending. It is dependent on international help for disposing of excess fissile material, and providing secure storage.<br>
			<br>
			The other nuclear weapon holding republics of the USSR, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan reverted to non-nuclear status in the mid 1990s. The decline in the economy and in the military continued through the decade, and Russia&#146;s nuclear weapons were often seen as its only remaining claim to world class status. With the election of Putin in March 2000 as President, the importance of national pride has been reinforced. To this extent nuclear power status remains important. There are also indications that nuclear weapons are seen as compensating for weakness in conventional forces.</p>
		<h4>British Nuclear Thinking</h4>
		<p>The British military were convinced of the need to have an atomic capability to match any other power which might develop such weapons. In August 1946, the Chief of the Air Staff put in a demand through normal procurement channels for an atomic bomb. The political decision to proceed was taken in January 1947. The bomb was developed independently of the United States, and successfully tested on 3 October 1952. It was assumed that the build up of nuclear stockpiles in America and Russia would be comparatively slow, and that the British force would therefore be of major significance in deterring the use of Soviet bombs against the British isles. The 1952 Chiefs of Staff Global Strategy Paper argued that more reliance should be placed on nuclear threats to contain Soviet expansion. The nuclear arsenal was seen as the counter to the Soviet conventional force superiority. It was not until 1956 that Britain had a significant operational nuclear capability with the coming into service of the V-bomber force. The dependence on the effectiveness of this force was such that the following year, the Defence White Paper stated that large conventional forces would no longer be necessary. The 800,000 men in the armed forces in 1956 were to be reduced to 375000 by 1962.<br>
			<br>
			There was a complete reliance on a massive retaliation strategy as a response to Soviet aggression; and Britain was the first country to base its national defence upon a declared policy of nuclear deterrence. As part of the 1962 arrangement by which the US supplied Polaris missiles for use with British nuclear weapons, the assignment of the British nuclear forces to NATO was formalised, and brought them into the American nuclear targeting plan. Prime Minister Macmillan insisted on preserving the option for independent use in the supreme national interest. This independence clause may have been predominantly to preserve Britain's great power role; but France was already expressing concern over the credibility of the American nuclear support for Europe, and this may also have been a factor. In 1964, the Defence White Paper did consider the possibility of a 'mistaken' Soviet belief in the unwillingness of America to defend Europe, and hence the need for a European nuclear power. </p>
		<p>The unwillingness of Britain and the other European NATO countries greatly to enhance their conventional capabilities meant that the American strategic nuclear guarantee remained the basis of the security of Western Europe. Yet as North America became more and more vulnerable to the Soviet strategic arsenal, this guarantee was perceived to be less credible. In this dilemma, the British deterrent had a new role to play. Defence Minister, Denis Healey has been credited with first postulating the 'second centre for decision making strategy in 1964.Through the 1970s, this concept was used in official statements about nuclear forces, and in the 1980 Open Government Document discussing the choice of the Polaris replacement, it was the major consideration:<br>
			<br>
			If Britain is to meet effectively the deterrent purpose of providing a second centre of decision-making within the alliance, our force has to be visibly capable of posing a massive threat on its own. </p>
		<p>The new Trident strategic missile system became operational from 1994 onwards building up to four submarines. By 1998 these represented the only nuclear systems fielded by the UK, and were limited to 48 warheads each. The rationale for this minimal force appears to be as an insurance policy against an uncertain future. A degree of ambiguity is retained as to its utility for deterring WMD attacks on a non-nuclear nature.</p>
		<h4>French Nuclear Thinking</h4>
		<p>Although French scientists had been involved in early work on the development of the atomic bomb, France - like Britain - had no prospect of sharing in the fruits of American research after the war. The trauma of occupation made the reestablishment of France as a major power within a secure Europe the great concern of post-war governments. While the formation of NATO was welcomed as an aid to security, there was considerable debate in 1949 as to the credibility of the Anglo-Saxon guarantees to the European mainland. The French military were well aware of the importance of atomic weapons, and much emphasis was placed on the tactics of the nuclear battlefield. This concern over the effect of atomic weapons on war tactics led to the emergence of a body of military opinion which considered them an essential part of the nation's arsenal. From the mid-1950s, this military view, coupled with the establishment hope that atomic weapons could give more strength per franc, formed a climate of opinion for the production of such weapons which could survive the changing governments.<br>
			<br>
			Through the changing coalition governments, the question of nuclear weapon development was raised at various times in the French parliament. A general understanding emerged that France was researching towards an eventual nuclear weapon capability. The Suez crisis of 1956 reinforced the mistrust of American protection, and a new CEA National Defense protocol was signed, which formally established a five year military programme. The decision to prepare for the first French atomic test was not taken until April 1958 by Premier Gaillard. What coherent policy discussion that there had been during the Fourth Republic suggested that the role seen for atomic weapons was as a part of the NATO Alliance, albeit as an independent great power. The advent of Charles de Gaulle and the Fifth Republic changed this. After an early attempt to wrest the control of NATO from the United States by a change to tripartite control, de Gaulle declared his position at a speech at the Ecole Militaire on 3 November 1959. Having dismissed the NATO concept of integrated forces, he went on to say:</p>
		<p><i>... what we must achieve during the coming years is a force capable of acting exclusively on our behalf, a force which has been conveniently called a force de frappe' susceptible to deployment anywhere at any time. It goes without saying that the basis for such a force will be atomic armament- whether we manufacture it or buy it- - but one which belongs to us.</i></p>
		<p>There was little discussion of the strategy or force structure necessary. The aims of de Gaulle in producing the force de frappe were: the restoration of French grandeur, the reunification of Europe, the subordination of West Germany and hence French leadership in Europe, and ultimately an independent role for Europe in the world.</p>
		<p>On 13 February 1960, France successfully tested its first atomic bomb. De Gaulle saw the nuclear force primarily as a diplomatic tool. His strategy is usually described as that of 'proportional deterrence'. The French posture was one of immediate and massive retaliation once French territory was threatened. The concept of flexible response was rejected on the grounds that Europe would be destroyed as the host to the battle. The leading strategic thinkers in France in the 1960s were Generals Gallois and Beaufre. The former strongly resisted the concept of tactical nuclear weapons and their use for graduated deterrence, and the latter highlighted the importance of the second decision centre, which improved the overall credibility of the NATO deterrent.</p>
		<p>Under de Gaulle, the nuclear strategy was completely interwoven with foreign policy. Up to 1962, he looked for power within the Western Alliance, and nuclear independence was the method of achieving this. From 1962 to 1965, he sought an independent position to deprive the Americans of control over the destiny of France. A nuclear strategy of tous azimuths was propounded, in which France must be prepared for attacks from any direction. The invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Soviets brought an improvement to French-NATO relationships and a change in the declared nuclear strategy. The new Chief of Staff, General Fourquet, dropped all reference to tous azimuths, and made it clear that the threat was once more perceived as being from the Soviets. Some reappraisal of the instant massive retaliation strategy also took place. This was necessary to assign a role to the newly developed tactical nuclear weapons, and may have been a case of technology determining doctrine. This was acceptance of flexible response, albeit with fewer - rungs on the escalation ladder and a lower nuclear threshold.It raised a number of problems in relations with NATO, given that such tactical weapons would need to be used against an enemy in West Germany.<br>
			<br>
			In France, the credibility of the nuclear deterrent was little questioned. The force was never large, was vulnerable on the ground, and the survivability of the Mirage IV was suspect after 1969. It was not until 1971 that the first submarine, Le Redoutable, became operational, with 18 land-based missiles coming the following year. France has not been enthusiastic about arms control measures which might limit either its weapon systems or their testing. It was prepared to continue weapon testing in 1995 against great international hostility. Although the rationale for its small nuclear forces is even more opaque today than ever, there is little sign of any internal pressure to disarm. It continues to see its ownership of a nuclear capability as important in terms of its world status, and as a leading power within Europe.</p>
		<h4>Chinese Nuclear Thinking</h4>
		<p>Mao Tse-tung refused to acknowledge the importance of atomic weapons. There was, however, no doubt that China expected to get the technology, if not the bombs, from the Soviets. In 1953, the Committee of Atomic Energy was set up in the Chinese Academy of Science. In 1955, the Soviet Union announced that it would help China to study the peaceful uses of atomic energy, and would provide a research reactor. Two years later, the 'New Technology for National Defence' agreement was signed, and in 1958, the first experimental reactor came on line. The following year, the Soviets withdrew their assistance and the Chinese were later to claim that this broke a promise, given by the Soviets, that they would provide China with a sample atomic bomb. During this period, the Chinese leaders both advocated general nuclear disarmament and also declared nuclear proliferation to be desirable. The rationale for these apparently conflicting policies was that either would break the nuclear monopoly of the United States and the Soviet Union.<br>
			<br>
			
			 It is a measure of the importance which Mao attached to the programme that as early as 16 October 1964, they tested their first static 20 kt atomic device. They rapidly increased yields, and reduced size, and by the test of 17 June 1967, they had exploded a thermonuclear device of 3 to 7 MT. The three years from first atomic test to first thermonuclear test compares with eight years for the United States, five years for Great Britain and four years for the Soviet Union. Those working on both the weapons and the delivery systems development must have been exempted from the excesses of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution which began in September 1965. As China did not test its first intercontinental ballistic missile until 1980, and only has around 20 such missiles available in 2001, this nuclear strategy of protecting China from the United States is difficult to follow. <br>
			<br>
			In addition to the deterrence of American attacks, nuclear weapons were also seen as a means of encouraging those peoples who were engaged in revolutionary wars. After the tenth test, a three megaton bomb on 20 September 1969, the announcement specified 'encouragement and support' given by Chinese nuclear weapons to the Vietnamese, the Laotians and the Palestinians, and to the people of all countries who are fighting for the people's liberation.  It is difficult to postulate a consistent nuclear strategy through Mao's time, given the internal turmoil of 1966 and 1967, the widening rift with the Soviets, and the eventual rapprochement with the United States in 1972. One commentator saw the Chinese as having five objectives: national security; regaining the lost great power status; extending influence in Asia; regaining lost territories; and leadership of the Communist world.<br>
			<br>
			
			The Chinese nuclear strategy after the death of Mao in 1976 was not made any clearer by the internal power struggles which took place. Test explosions continued, with a record four in one year in 1976. Rocket development also continued. There was no urgency in deploying operational forces. The missile force were all liquid fuel, and hence vulnerable to first strike attack. The  bombs could only be delivered by aging Soviet-designed bombers, which would have had little chance of penetrating Soviet air defences. One submarine had been produced in 1970, with missile launch tubes, but the missiles were not tested until ten years later, and  further force development remains slow to this day. That it is prepared to bear the economic burden, without gaining a significant operational capability, suggests that China's strategy is predominantly that of an insurance policy against future world developments. <br>
			<br>
			The Chinese have reacted strongly against the current US proposals for national missile defences. They see themselves as the main losers if such a system were successfully deployed. It appears that they will take a renewed interest in nuclear systems if NMD deployment is started as they perceive the US as a real military threat. They look to their nuclear status to ensure that the rest of the world does not interfere with their internal affairs.</p>

			<h3>The Next Three Nuclear States</h3>
		</div>
		<div align="left">
			<h4>Israeli Nuclear Strategy</h4>
		</div>
		<p>It has been said that Israel has always been a nuclear country. Within a year of the establishment of the state in 1948, the first plans for the nuclear research programme had been made. The Israel Atomic Energy Commission was established in 1952 and was, significantly, placed within the Defence Ministry. No written terms of reference were produced for the Commission. Israeli scientists were sent abroad for training, an agreement was signed with France in 1953 for atomic cooperation, and another with the United States in 1954. In 1957, Israel and France concluded a secret agreement which was to result in a large research reactor being built for the Defence Ministry at Dimona in the northern Negev. In late 1964, the Dimona reactor became critical, and started producing about 8 kg of plutonium per year. CIA reports have also revealed that Israel obtained 'large quantities of enriched uranium by clandestine means'.</p>
		<p>Prime Minister Eshkol in 1966 and President Katzir in 1974 stated that Israel would not be the first to introduce nuclear weapons into the Middle East. This somewhat cryptic posture is useful in increasing the uncertainty of Israel's potential enemies. A report  in 1976 of a CIA briefing claimed that the Israeli arsenal of 13 weapons was prepared for possible use at the start of the 1973 war. Defence Minister Moshe Dyan was quoted in the report as justifying the Israeli nuclear option as 'Israel has no choice, with our manpower we cannot physically go on acquiring more and more tanks and more and more planes'.<br>
			<br>
			There is little doubt that Israel is a nuclear weapon state. Initially it raced, by all possible methods, to provide itself with a last resort capability. This could be used if there was an imminent danger of being 'pushed into the sea' by its Arab enemies. It then be developed a nuclear war-fighting capability to compensate for its numerical inferiority. Its ambiguous position does not appear to have deterred its opponents from aggression. The size of its nuclear arsenal remains open to question but is variously assessed at between 100 and 200 nuclear warheads. It appears that associated missile development is consolidating the Israeli nuclear capability with the possibility of submarine launched cruise missiles.<br>
			<br>
			Israel has been uniquely favoured in its ability to become a new nuclear weapon state. The United States has protected it from the international pariah status that other potential proliferators have suffered. It has a strong technological industry and a readily perceived threat to its existence. The WMD programmes in Libya, Iraq, Iran and Egypt have all reinforced its will to retain and strengthen its strategic nuclear capability. Given its willingness to use pre-emptive action, the possibility of a nuclear warfighting strategy remains possible for Israel.</p>
		<h4>Indian Nuclear Strategy</h4>
		<p>India has a tradition of atomic energy research, which can rival that of the other nuclear powers. Homi J. Bhabha, the father of the Indian bomb, set up an institute of nuclear physics research in 1945. Under Nehru, a joint Canada-India reactor, CIRUS, became operational in 1960. With a second research reactor in 1961 and a plutonium plant completed in 1964, the Indians had a sound base for nuclear weapon production. Indian public opinion was becoming more concerned about the dangers of a world divided into the nuclear 'haves' and 'have-nots'. The Sino-Indian conflict of 1962, the Chinese nuclear test in 1964, and the war with Pakistan in 1965 produced a strong body of opinion favouring nuclear weapons for India.</p>
		<p>India was a leading opponent of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which was viewed as a discriminatory arrangement, set up by the nuclear weapon states for their own benefit. Even after India finally rejected the NPT in 1967, there was no apparent urgency to complete the work on the atomic bomb. Indira Gandhi maintained that the option for Peaceful Nuclear Explosions (PNEs) was being retained. On 18 May 1974, an underground test explosion of a Hiroshima-sized device was successfully carried out. It was seen internally as a great boost to India's prestige. The stated purpose of the test was to continue research into PNEs, and the Indian literature of the time abounds with schemes for using PNEs in engineering projects, such as making harbours, hollowing out gas storage cavities, and extracting minerals and oil. All this despite the declining interest in America and Russia, and the emerging world scientific view that the disadvantages of nuclear explosives outweighed the advantages.</p>
		<p>There were other views as to the use of nuclear explosions. Writing just before the test, the Director of the Indian Institute of Defence Studies drew attention to the difference in treatment which Washington gave to India and China. Quoting one of President Nixon's aides as saying that 800 million Chinese armed with nuclear weapons could not be ignored, he speculated that 600 million Indians similarly armed might prompt a visit from a future American President to New Delhi. Another commentator writing at the time of the test was rather more specific about the role of the PNE:</p>
		<p><i>It cannot be denied that India's PNE has military implications as well. It demonstrates India's capabilities in the nuclear field and is a step in the direction of establishing India as a centre of independent decision- making in the world.</i></p>
		<p>Canada suspended all nuclear aid following the test explosion, and the United States took some mildly punitive action. Nevertheless, the Gandhi government kept the option of further tests open. No further PNE tests were undertaken, and Prime Minister Desai said, 'We do not want to have any atomic weapons under any conditions, and do not want even to have explosions of any kind'. Even if these statements were true, the return of Mrs Gandhi to power on 14 January 1980 made them of little relevance. After taking office, she accelerated India's military modernisation programme.<br>
			<br>
			If India had been stockpiling nuclear weapons, it could have produced perhaps as many as 200 warheads or bombs. It has an aircraft delivery capability and has been developing its satellite and missile technology to pose a deterrent threat to China. While it could use its nuclear force against Pakistan, it has no need except to deter a Pakistan nuclear threat. The world was aware of India&#146;s nuclear capability in 1998 before it conducted the series of test explosions. However what was surprising was the complexity of the two tests on 11 and 13 May 1998. A total of five devices were tested and included thermonuclear, fission and low yield warheads.</p>
		<p>This was a dramatic change of policy which followed the election of the pro-nuclear Vajpayee government in March 1998. The rationale for becoming overtly nuclear includes concern over both China and Pakistani nuclear capabilities, domestic political needs to show strength, and a wish to be taken as a regional leader and perhaps global power. It is interesting that the test marked a change in international perception of the nuclear qualifications for permanent membership of the UN Security Council. While each of the P5 members was also one of the 5 nuclear weapon states, India&#146;s ambitions to gain this status have undoubtedly been set back by its nuclear weapon tests.</p>
		<h4>Pakistan Nuclear Strategy </h4>
		<p>There is some debate as to whether India or Pakistan was the first to start a nuclear weapon research programme. There are indications that President Ayub Khan started initial moves as early as 1965 in response to a perceived possible future Indian threat. India has a much longer involvement in atomic energy, but it appears that both began the pursuit of a nuclear capability in earnest after the 1971 war. Given the lack of civil atomic expertise, Pakistan has found it more difficult to develop a broad weapons programme. It sought to follow the plutonium route, but once this became clear to the international community then assistance was reduced and had ceased by 1976. It switched to the uranium enrichment route about this time under the leadership of A.Q.Khan. The United States took a number of embargo measures to prevent the transfer of nuclear technology to Pakistan by third parties between 1976 and 1985. However economic and military assistance was restored following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.<br>
			<br>
			
			President Zia used the more relaxed international regime as an opportunity to move the nuclear weapons programme forward. It was believed that a rudimentary weapon was available by 1987. In parallel with this work Zia made a number of arms control proposals to India, including the proposal for a South Asian nuclear free zone. This would suggest that the Pakistan nuclear weapon requirement is entirely and exclusively to deter the use of Indian nuclear weapons. The export controls on nuclear related technology from the West increased Pakistan&#146;s dependence for help from China, which has a common interest in neutralising the Indian nuclear threat. Chinese assistance was obtained for the uranium enrichment operation.<br>
			<br>
			The decision to demonstrate its nuclear capability by testing was in direct response to the Indian tests. Pakistan needed to show its own population that it was able to deter an Indian nuclear threat. Given the disparity of the military capabilities between the two states, it is likely that Pakistan also sees nuclear weapons as compensation for conventional force weakness. The Pakistan nuclear test took place on 28 May 1998 just two weeks after the first Indian test. They claimed to have detonated five devices although seismic data suggests it may have been three explosions.</p>
		<h4>Near and Aspiring Nuclear Powers</h4>
		<p>For future defence planning, it is important to know which states are interested in acquiring nuclear weapons and how much progress they have made. Inevitably information is limited as the states concerned try to hide their research and development programmes. International interest currently centres on Iran, North Korea and Iraq. However at other times, Libya, Egypt and Syria and Taiwan have been in the spotlight. The US Central Intelligence Agency provides reports to Congress on the current assessment on a six monthly basis.</p>
		<h4>Iran</h4>
		<p>The CIA report for August 2000 shows Iran as particularly active in the pursuit of nuclear capability. It warns that Iran continues to seek fissile material and technology for weapons development and uses civilian entities as part of an elaborate system devoted to furthering these efforts. Iran has many reasons for wanting a nuclear capability. They have been listed as building Iran as the major power of the region, defending against threats from US, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, and compensating for conventional force weakness. It faces a real possibility of attack by WMD in any future war with Iraq, and needs to deter their use. It also worries about threats from Afghanistan, and beyond that the now nuclear armed Pakistan. The co-operation between Turkey and Israel is also a source of insecurity. The US support for Israel, despite its illegal nuclear weapon status, is another factor in the equation.<br>
			<br>
			From the Iranian perspective, the acquisition of nuclear weapons is entirely rational. They provide, at lower cost than a large modernisation of conventional forces, a significant enhancement in national security from a large number of potential enemies. The international reaction is unlikely to isolate the country more than it is at present. The only difficult decision will be whether to become an overt power through nuclear testing.</p>
		<h4>North Korea</h4>
		<p>North Korea&#146;s nuclear weapon programme dates from the 1970s. It faced a potential nuclear threat from the US during the Korean War, and was also concerned that South Korea subsequently might gain a nuclear capability. In 1984, it was clear that North Korea had established an indigenous nuclear programme using local uranium and graphite in a reactor. The reprocessing plant for separating plutonium was spotted in 1986, and a larger reactor was begun in 1988. The August 2000 CIA report to Congress says that North Korea has made enough plutonium for one to two nuclear weapons and continues to purchase items that potentially could be used in nuclear weapons production.<br>
			<br>
			Like Iran, North Korea has been isolated from the international community. It also believes that it is threatened by a South Korea with nuclear potential, and that the US would be prepared to use nuclear weapons in the region. It has therefore defence and deterrence motivations for developing nuclear weapons. It has also learned that it is taken much more seriously by the rest of the world if it appears to be on the route to a nuclear weapon capability. The assistance it has received for its civilian nuclear programme is as payment for refraining from pursuing fissile material production.</p>
		<h4>Iraq</h4>
		<p>Iraq has been trying to acquire nuclear weapons since the mid 1970s40 . Its reactor at Oziraq required a supply of enriched uranium fuel, which could be diverted. The annual supply would have produced one atomic bomb at most. It was destroyed by a pre-emptive Israeli raid in 1981. It dispersed its programme over the country from then onwards and continued work on bomb design. The Gulf war of 1991 followed by the UN inspection regime found and destroyed the key parts of the Iraqi nuclear weapon programme. It became clear that a massive programme (called Petrochemical 3) had employed 20,000 workers over some thirty different sites. They were exploring different uranium enrichment technologies. It appears however that they had not been successful in producing a nuclear weapon. Once the UN inspections were stopped in 1998, the US and UK in Operation Desert Fox in December 1998 destroyed any remaining suspect sites. However it is likely that Saddam Hussein continues to seek ways to produce Weapons of Mass Destruction. The CIA report of August 2000 says:</p>
		<p><i>We do not have any direct evidence that Iraq has used the period since Desert Fox to reconstitute its WMD programs, although given its past behaviour, this type of activity must be regarded as likely.</i></p>
		<p>Iraq has also been pursuing Chemical and Biological weapons of mass destruction, and has used Chemical Weapons in its war with Iran , and for internal security operations as well. It shares with North Korea and Iran a high degree of international isolation. It has had recent wars with Iran, Kuwait, the large US-led coalition of the Gulf War, and the smaller US/UK operation Desert Fox. Israel has carried out a pre-emptive attack on a nuclear reactor. It is subject to no-fly zone patrols and economic sanctions. It sees itself as having a natural leadership role for the Arab world yet surrounded by potential enemies. It needs nuclear weapons for prestige, for deterrence and perhaps for warfighting. It may be that given its long history of failure to procure a nuclear weapon, it is now more focused on the chemical and biological alternatives.</p>
		<div align="center">
			<h4>Other potential proliferators</h4>
		</div>
		<p>Just as Iraq has been trying for many years to build a nuclear weapon, so a number of other states have been interested over recent years, but are currently less engaged, and may have stopped because of various factors. Syria and Libya had aspirations to nuclear status in the past, but appear less committed in recent times. Given particular circumstances, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Taiwan and Egypt might become interested. In terms of missile delivery systems, the only nations either operating or developing capabilities for missiles of over 500km range are: the 5 nuclear weapon states, India, Iran, Iraq, Israel, N Korea, Libya, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Taiwan. All of these are in reaction to regional rather than global balances of power, although gaining a nuclear capability would change their status within the international community. Iran is active in its development of both cruise and long range ballistic missiles. Iraq can do little about longer range missiles while UN sanctions continue. Libya has tried unsuccessfully to obtain longer range missile technology. North Korea is actively obtaining such technology from China.<br>
			<br>
			It appears that the anti-proliferation regime has been successful in reducing the number of states that are likely to gain nuclear weapons in the near term.</p>
		<div align="center">
			<h4>Powers that have discarded the nuclear option</h4>
		</div>
		<p>In looking at the motivation for states to acquire nuclear weapons, it is also important to consider why some states have changed their views about acquiring nuclear status. South Africa, Argentina and Brazil were prospective proliferators who have subsequently given up their nuclear programmes. Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus gave up the nuclear capabilities that they fielded as part of the Soviet Union&#146;s Cold War forces. To these states can be added a list of technically advanced countries which could readily develop a nuclear weapon capability but have chosen not to do so. These would include most European Union nations (except Britain and France), Japan, Canada and Australia.<br>
			<br>
			
			South Africa had a well advanced nuclear weapon programme in the 1970s and 1980s, when it was a regime that was isolated internationally because of its apartheid policies. It felt that it was surrounded by potential enemies and had no allies to call upon in the event of a battle for survival. Despite the apparent military irrelevance of a nuclear weapon to the skirmishes between the Front Line States and South Africa, the rationale must have been similar to that of Israel. It would be  have been difficult for the rest of the world to ignore a crisis in which nuclear weapons were a factor. The decision to abandon the programme was taken as the international isolation of the apartheid years was removed.<br>
			<br>
			Argentina and Brazil were both sources of proliferation concern in the 1970s and there were predictions that they both might follow the Indian example of testing a so-called peaceful nuclear explosion. It was assumed that they were seeking the prestige of nuclear weapon status and confirmation as major regional powers. The military leadership seems to have been a factor in the decision to move along the nuclear route, and the return to civilian democratic government, coupled with economic pressures, has driven the process of moving away from nuclear weapons. A progressive series of confidence building measures from the mid 1980s meant that both states have proved to each other and the international community that they had given up nuclear weapon aspirations by 1995.<br>
			<br>
			Those developed states which have the nuclear material, the technology and the wealth to build nuclear weapons but choose not to are mostly covered by security arrangements with other nuclear powers. It reduces the incentive to spend money, and goodwill, on a nuclear programme if a security guarantee from a nuclear power is available.</p>
		<div align="center">
			<h4>Why States Go Nuclear</h4>
		</div>
		<p>There are a number of common factors between the motives of nuclear weapon states and those of aspirant nuclear states. However in making comparisons, the changing world view of nuclear weapons over time has also to be considered. Before 1945, there was no knowledge of the nature of a war in which atomic bombs were used. While some of the scientists associated with the Manhattan Project were uneasy about the potential implications of the weapon that they were designing, there was no experience for the wider international community to draw upon. Since then a complex structure of treaties has emerged to regulate, restrict and inhibit the growth of nuclear weapon states. Today, even the five original nuclear weapon states feel it necessary to declare that they will eliminate their weapons eventually. Working in the opposite direction over time has been the technology of the weapons. While in the early 1940s only a major power could contemplate the enormous costs of embarking on such an uncertain project, now much smaller nations may be able to put together the necessary enabling capabilities.</p>
		<h4>Insecurity</h4>
		<p>The most common strategic reason for developing a nuclear weapon capability is insecurity. If a state feels extremely threatened, it may see a nuclear capability as its only defence. This will be particularly the case if the perceived threat is itself nuclear (or more lately perhaps Biological). The first nuclear weapon programme was developed as the answer to the potential development of atomic weapons by Germany in World War 2, and was continued for similar fears about the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union developed its nuclear capability as part of its armoury against a hostile West. China saw itself as vulnerable to a surprise attack from the United States, and it needed nuclear capability to deter such an attack. Israel saw itself as surrounded by enemies who wanted to sweep it into the sea. Iraq sees itself at risk from Israeli nuclear weapons, and from western nuclear powers and potentially from Iran. Similarly Iran fears Iraq, Israel and the United States. India saw itself vulnerable to Chinese nuclear weapons in any war, and Pakistan saw itself at risk from Indian weapons. International isolation can increase a state&#146;s sense of insecurity, and therefore its need for a nuclear capability. This was the case for South Africa in apartheid times, and has been true of North Korea, Iran, Iraq and Libya at various times. The international isolation today will normally deepen if there are signs of a nuclear weapon programme under development, and this may reinforce the belief that such weapons are needed. On the other hand an extended security arrangement with a friendly nuclear power reduces the need to undertake a national nuclear programme.</p>
		<h4>Aids to Victory</h4>
		<p>While the acquisition of nuclear weapons for reasons of insecurity will primarily be centred on deterring nuclear attack, the weapons have also been seen as warfighting capabilities. The United States used them against the Japanese in order to secure victory in 1945. The use of them against Russia and China may also have been contemplated. Certainly the use of nuclear weapons in the Korean War was considered by President Truman. The Soviet Union had a military strategy which incorporated its tactical nuclear weapons into its warfighting doctrine. It can also be argued that the NATO doctrine of flexible response recognised nuclear weapons as having some utility in war. However, the main purpose of this doctrine was to reinforce deterrence rather than conceive of victory over the Warsaw Pact through nuclear use. While military victory through the use of nuclear weapons may have been a conceptual possibility in the early days, it is unlikely to be a convincing rationale for acquisition today, given the likelihood of massive retaliation by another nuclear state.</p>
		<h4>Status and Influence</h4>
		<p>A powerful motivation for acquiring nuclear weapons has been the effect on national status and prestige. Britain seems to have thought least deeply about the implications of embarking on a post-war programme independent from the United States. There was a natural assumption that it would need to have atomic weapons in order to retain its place as a leading world power. Similarly France saw the need for a nuclear capability to underpin its return to the world stage as a leading player. Given that each of the five permanent members of the security council are also the first five nuclear weapon states, the association of national status and influence with nuclear weapons is visible to others. It is possible that India may have had such motivation in its bid to become the regional leader. It certainly feels that its population and economy merit much greater international influence than it is accorded. However, the changing international approach to proliferation means that India has not gained greater international status from its weapons. Indeed it is likely to have put back the possibility of it gaining permanent security council membership. Argentina and Brazil may also have been looking for status from their programmes.<br>
			<br>
			If prestige is a declining factor in nuclear weapon acquisition, influence still remains important. In the post Cold War world, potential intervention by the more powerful international actors is a threat that worries a number of smaller countries. There is an assumption that this threat can be much reduced by the ownership of strategic weapons of mass destruction. The question is asked 'Would NATO have intervened in Kosovo against a nuclear armed Serbia?'. Iraq, Iran, North Korea, Libya and Taiwan can all use this thinking to justify weapons acquisition.</p>
		<h4>Bigger Bang for your Buck</h4>
		<p>In the early days, both American and British governments argued that nuclear weapons could provide a cheaper military capability than large conventional forces. John Foster Dulles is credited with boasting that they could give a 'bigger bang for a buck'. While the absolute cost of building an atomic bomb has dropped over the years, this argument is a less significant factor. Nuclear weapons do not replace conventional forces given their lack of utility for warfighting in the modern world. While the direct research, development and production costs may be much reduced, the economic implications for aspirant nuclear states can be adverse. The international community may show its disapproval of a nuclear programme through the use of economic sanctions as has been seen in Iraq. Nevertheless Iran seems to have decided that a nuclear programme may save it from spending more on conventional forces.</p>
		<h4>Internal Civilian and Military Pressures</h4>
		<p>While nations will justify their nuclear weapon programmes for external security reasons, there are often internal domestic pressures driving the procurement. The main drive in Britain immediately after World War 2 came from the military establishment. It was bureaucratic momentum that kept the French programme in being before de Gaulle came to power. Pakistan officials made it clear that they would have to respond quickly to India&#146;s test as much for domestic political reasons as anything else.<br>
			<br>
			Today it is more difficult to envisage the decision to embark on a nuclear weapon programme as being taken as routinely as it was by Britain. The international community ensures that any state has to weigh up all the factors before taking on the restrictions which will inevitably follow. Internal pressures may accelerate (or inhibit) a programme which is already in being. They will also have an effect on the decision to remain a nuclear weapon state. Thus South Africa was able to stop its programme as part of its new internal structure. Britain has reduced its capability to just four submarines with missiles, and has no tactical weapons left. Yet internal political issues make it very difficult for it to go to the final step of nuclear disarmament.</p>
		<h4>Just in Case</h4>
		<p>An important consideration in nuclear doctrine is an inability to predict the future. China has never had a particularly consistent or logical nuclear doctrine. I appears that it wished to ensure that it had nuclear capability in case it became crucially important at some time in the future. Britain and France both used the arguments that they reinforced deterrence by being second centres of decision. If the Soviet Union were to think that the United States would not risk nuclear retaliation in order to defend Europe, then the French and British nuclear weapons entered the deterrence equation. They increase Soviet uncertainty and strengthened deterrence. Today the British nuclear force is entirely justified as an insurance policy against an uncertain future. While such arguments are used to retain nuclear weapons, they are insufficiently strong to be the primary drivers in the acquisition of such capabilities today, given the international difficulties that a potential proliferator faces.</p>
		<div align="center">
			<h4>Conclusion</h4>
		</div>
		<p>Nuclear weapons are in decline. Both the number of nuclear states and the total number of weapons peaked in the 1980s. The decline in numbers of warheads is likely to continue unless missile defence deployments cause countermoves in China and Russia. The advantages of nuclear status are much more limited in the 21st Century than they were in the early years of the nuclear world. In those states where international isolation and insecurity feed on one other, nuclear weapons may still appear to provide some kind of solution. Unfortunately the suspicion of a nuclear programme will increase the international isolation. Regional status can still be a factor, and increasingly it is likely that deterring intervention by the international community will be a motive for acquiring nuclear weapons. The problem is limited in scale, and can be addressed by reducing isolation, promoting democracy, and where necessary extending security guarantees. Confidence building measures have a place, but need time to work. In all of this the nuclear weapon states need to continue their agreed path to nuclear disarmament.</p>
