<P>It is an unusual publishing event to have as controversial a
figure as Bomber Harris answering his critics from the grave. At
first sight, this volume looks like one of a thousand air
enthusiast's coffee table books: large, heavy with a Bomber Command
badge and a photograph of a Halifax aircraft on its glossy cover.
Open it, and you find something different. This is no modern
illustrated delight of the graphic artist, but it is full of dense
text at around 1000 words per page. For this is a reproduction of the
official classified personal report of his time as Commander-in-Chief
of Bomber Command, which Harris wrote in October 1945.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Even within the confines of the Whitehall, his report stirred
great emotions. Perhaps this is not surprising when the report
includes such gems as "The Air Ministry, however, insisted on the
formation of a separate Pathfinding Force as a separate Group -yet
another occasion when a Commander in the field was over-ruled at the
dictation of junior staff officers in the Air Ministry." The Air
Staff prepared a memorandum which "amplifies some and corrects
certain others of the statements made in the text" and attached the
two documents together. Reading both pieces, they show a yawning gulf
between operational commander and air staff. Harris has written a
self-satisfied glowing testimonial to the achievements of his
Command. He arranges his statistics to show how effectiveness
improved during his time. When there are problems, he attributes
blame and shows how well he coped. The Air Staff memorandum is
unsigned, in the passive voice, and is dated March 1948. With the
benefit of considerable hindsight, the air staff can show how
prescient they were, and how their advice was invariably well
justified. Both sections are in that sense self-serving.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>For those unable to decide where the truth lies, it is fortunate
that an excellent modern commentary by Sebastian Cox, the editor of
this air power series, is included. He identifies each of the areas
of dispute and explains the issues. The first, and perhaps most
crucial, question was whether Harris was right in his premise that
his primary task was the destruction of Germany's morale and
industrial cities. The air staff memorandum makes it clear that their
intention was to move to precision bombing as soon as the capability
permitted. Harris does not seem to have had much faith in the new
precision bombing techniques. It is not clear whether Harris had been
personally involved in giving the code name "Crackers" to the
experiments with the new Gee navigation system, but there were those
in Whitehall who felt it was symptomatic of the Bomber Command
attitude.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Apart from the carping at the Air Ministry, Harris shows little
emotion part from elation at success. He records that the loss of 500
of his aircraft in 16 raids on Berlin as an attrition rate of 6.2%:
"... it could not be regarded as excessive in relation to the
magnitude of the task." He uses city acreage destroyed as his
performance criterion. One of his charts shows bombing accuracy
improving by a factor of two between April and June of 1943, yet the
weight of bombing effort on cities also climbs. For those looking for
his thoughts on the bombing of Dresden, he provides one paragraph
with the technical details of the attack, and the claim that the
effect on the whole German nation was great. In his summary of the
results of the bombing, he does not place Dresden in his most
successful category. With 59% of the built-up area destroyed, it just
fails to make his top category of 23 German cities with more than 60%
destruction.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>There is one further commentary in the book. It is a German view
from the military historian Horst Boog. He rightly raises the
question as to why Harris was left in command if his views were so
divergent from those of his masters in Whitehall. In a fairly
sympathetic piece, he points out that Bomber Command was also
expending considerable effort attacking selective targets.
Nevertheless, Harris's own report makes it abundantly clear that he
remained an advocate of the area bombing of cities as the path to
victory, even when precision bombing techniques became available.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>This is a remarkable book, which will appeal not just to the World
War 2 historian, but also to those who enjoy an insight into the way
Whitehall operated 50 years ago. There may even be lessons for today.
