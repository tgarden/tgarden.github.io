<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The International Development Select
Committee has done a very useful service in producing its report on
the February Mozambique disaster relief operation so quickly. At the
time it was clear that the effectiveness of the UK response was in
danger of being undermined by inter-Departmental wrangling. The
Committee is in no doubt that Clare Short's Department for
International Development (DFID) did an exceptional job. They are
less complimentary about various aspects of the MoD's handling of the
crisis. The most damning conclusion is that: "We consider that events
in Mozambique demonstrate that MoD is not yet as flexible, speedy and
cost-effective enough to be automatically and seriously considered
for deployment by DIFD."  This is a serious criticism given that
there is an expectation that the armed forces will be used in
humanitarian relief operations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	While the report addresses weaknesses in
the UN system, and also seeks better mechanisms for bringing in NATO
assets to help in such operations, it is the lack of "joined-up
government" in the UK which comes across most strongly. The armed
forces are rightly proud of the countless humanitarian operations in
which their skills have been used. Whether it is flood, earthquakes,
volcanoes or famine, there has been a great record of rapid UK
military assistance over the years. This public acknowledgement, that
the MoD's approach to DIFD's request for help hampered the military
contribution, will do little for morale on the front-line. </FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	What will the effect of the report be? It
will be surprising if the MoD accepts the criticisms as justified.
However, MOD Ministers are likely to make it clear internally that
they would not wish to be embarrassed again when the next disaster
strikes. MOD Finance staff are likely to demand (probably
unsuccessfully) clearer guidance on inter-departmental charging
policy. Defence Operations staff will add a few new volumes to their
contingency plans in the light of lessons learned. Perhaps the most
significant change might be a greater sympathy towards directing more
funds towards DIFD at the expense of Defence. After all, if Clare
Short could do so well without using defence resources in the first
instance, why not let DIFD take a greater part in managing the
resources for these activities? </FONT></P>
