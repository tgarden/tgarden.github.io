			<h3>Successive Defence Reviews</h3>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The circumstances of the Cold War meant that UK armed forces had to be structured and equipped to conduct high intensity conflict. Confronting a super power required weaponry of ever increasing complexity and cost.</p>
			<p>Even so, the invasion of the Falkland Islands in 1982 reminded us that problems could arise in unexpected places. Over the next ten years, UK defence planners continued to try to maintain a broad spread of capabilities. For some of this time, they were helped by a 3% per annum real growth in the defence budget.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The tension between NATO needs and wider capabilities had not been resolved when the Soviet Union crumbled. The end of the Cold War signalled an almost immediate downsizing of all three Services. Even this was not enough to balance the books, and by the mid 90s a further review was needed. Malcolm Rifkind, Defence Secretary, sought relief by contracting out many support area tasks to the private sector.&nbsp; This resulted in yet further reductions in numbers of servicemen and women.&nbsp; As more and more specialist tasks were moved to the civilian sector, so the availability of uniformed, trained specialists fell.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>With the arrival of the Labour government in 1997, the new Defence Secretary, George Robertson carried out yet another major Strategic Defence Review.&nbsp; Although it was said to be from first principles, and not about saving money, the total budget was little changed as a result. Given the absence of a direct threat to the UK, it assumed that the UK armed forces would be used primarily as a force for good in the world.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><b>Tasks for the 21<sup>st</sup> Century</b></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>While much of the&nbsp; 1990s was taken up with peacekeeping operations, the Gulf War and the Kosovo air campaign reminded planners that the need to fight at the high intensity end of the spectrum had not disappeared. Nevertheless, there was an assumption that these conflicts would be the exception.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The Armed Forces have been increasingly stretched since the end of the Cold War. Newer tasks since 1991 have included the commitments to various countries in former Yugoslavia - first Croatia, then Bosnia and Croatia and now Kosovo and Bosnia.&nbsp; Iraq has been in the picture throughout. On top of these have come peace support operations in Sierra Leone, East Timor, Afghanistan and the Congo.&nbsp; When the foot-and-mouth epidemic descended into chaos, the Army was brought in.&nbsp; When floods &#150; an increasing hazard in the UK &#150; threatened life, the country looked to the military for help.&nbsp; The fireman&rsquo;s strike required 19,000 servicemen to be stood by and then deployed for tasks in aid of the civil power.</p>
			<p>The events of 11 September 2001 have changed perceptions again. International terrorism has become the prime security concern at home and abroad. Given the wish of al-Qaeda style terrorists to cause the maximum number of deaths, fears about the implications of proliferation resurfaced. The new concern is that fanatical terrorists might acquire the weapons of mass killing that had previously been held by state actors.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The effect on the 9/11 attacks on the USA has had a profound affect on how the traditional alliances of the West can operate. While the Kosovo campaign of 1999 was a NATO operation, the war in Afghanistan was not. The US made bilateral arrangements with selected allies, and ignored NATO's unconstrained offers of help. For the intervention in Iraq in 2003, allies were divided and there was no prospect of an alliance operation. In the end, the US undertook the war with UK, Australia and Poland as the only supporters in the field.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>We now find ourselves in a novel position. Both Europe and the US have agreed what the threats are for the coming years. They are from terrorism, proliferation, failing states and regional conflicts. Despite this consensus on the threat, there seems little agreement on the strategic priorities. The major divide across the Atlantic is between US reliance on the big stick of military offensive power, and a European focus on the international system, diplomacy and engagement. The UK continues to try to be a bridge between both points of view. Yet this can lead to difficulty when it comes to the hard decisions that need to be made in defence planning. There also remain questions over whether the UK has invested enough in defending at home against possible terror attacks.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>The Incoherent UK Defence Programme</h3>
			<p><u>&nbsp;</u></p>
			<p>Last year, the Foreign Office, unusually, issued its own White Paper.&nbsp; This was published immediately before the 2003 Defence White Paper.&nbsp; In the classrooms of defence colleges around the world, students could be forgiven for expecting the defence policy to be derived from the foreign policy paper. Military power is the servant of foreign policy.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>In an ideal world, we might establish our foreign policy objectives first, and then decide how best to achieve them.&nbsp; Implementation of aspects of foreign policy may, after all, demand particular military capabilities.&nbsp; Military forces will also be needed to support counter terrorism and provide aid to the civil power in national emergencies.&nbsp; A defence policy should weave these multi-stranded requirements into a cost-effective structure, which ensured that all the tasks could and be undertaken in a cost-effective way.&nbsp; The Treasury would then pay the bill.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>In the real world, however, there are many competing pressures on the public purse.&nbsp; Elected politicians must decide&nbsp; how much of the national cake they are prepared to spend on defence.&nbsp; For much of the Cold War this amounted to around 5% of GDP.&nbsp; Today the proportion is 2.3% and declining.&nbsp; This defence budget bears little relationship to either foreign or defence policy needs.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The process of developing the mix of military capabilities remains one of assessing priorities and making hard choices.&nbsp; As a nation, we appear to have decided that we do not wish to fund our armed forces to enable them to carry out all their possible tasks, from high-intensity conflict through nation-building, conflict prevention and counter-terrorism, down to replacing striking fire-fighters.&nbsp; Yet, paradoxically, the government demands that they are prepared to carry all these roles out at any time and in any place.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Security is the first responsibility of any government. If the funding for defence is set at a level which makes it impossible to cover all risks, then a difficult political judgement is required over how best to allocate limited funds. Merely slicing capabilities ever thinner is no longer an option. The UK is now at a stage where some major procurement projects need to be re-examined if today&rsquo;s essential capabilities are to be sustained.The defence budget is in crisis partly because a string of flagship projects&nbsp; - including the Nimrod maritime reconnaissance aircraft, the Eurofighter, the Astute submarine and the Brimstone anti-armour missile &#150; are overshooting their costs by large amounts. The other major capital development is the plan to procure two large aircraft carriers, for delivery in 2012 and 2015.&nbsp; The costs of this project are expected to rise very significantly.&nbsp; Capacity and capability are already being traded in an attempt to keep the project affordable.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The 2003 Defence White Paper indicates that future defence priorities will be shaped&nbsp; primarily by the need to work with the US at the high-intensity end of the operational spectrum.&nbsp; This will mean a considerable investment in the necessary technology&nbsp; to produce what is known as &lsquo;network enabled capability&rsquo;. The extraordinary investment of the US military in research and development means that this path will be difficult and expensive for the United Kingdom to follow.&nbsp; Going down this route means that other capabilities in the conflict prevention, nation-building, counter-terrorism and humanitarian fields are likely to take second place.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>The way forward</h3>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>British forces undertake conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction tasks with greater success than most other militaries. The UK wants rightly to be a force for good in the world. Britain works with the grain of the EU and the UN when it takes on these burdens. Whatever changes are to made to defence priorities, it must be sensible to safeguard this area of unique national expertise.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Prevention of conflict often means early and quick deployment of capable forces.&nbsp; This makes air and sea transport a procurement priority.&nbsp; In this respect, the recent procurement disaster over Chinook helicopters is particularly unfortunate. Reconnaissance and intelligence are as important in peace operations as in warfighting.&nbsp; Post-conflict reconstruction requires forces capable of undertaking a variety of tasks, including the protection of private sector and other agencies, involved in clearing up battlefields, over a period of time.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Today the US is the only superpower.&nbsp; While it must make sense to retain the ability to contribute to high-intensity operations, as part of a &lsquo;coalition of the willing&rsquo;, that should not be at the expense of our ability to contribute to other lower intensity operations which, on present trends, will occur more often and last longer.&nbsp; To contribute effectively, British forces must be structured, trained and equipped appropriately.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>British Armed Forces remain able to make a unique contribution to international security.&nbsp; With the right resources, they are able to contribute in every aspect of the military art.&nbsp; In these dangerous times, we should look again at the need for more resources for defence. However, if the full spread of capabilities continue to be unaffordable, a key choice must be made.&nbsp; If it is UK policy that serious warfighting can only be conducted under US leadership and with US capabilities, we should accept a reduction in our investment in this area.&nbsp; This would allow us to build up a well-equipped, readily deployable force, designed to stabilise troubled areas around the world.&nbsp; In this we have unique, world-class expertise.&nbsp; The tragedy is that it is in danger of being lost through underinvestment.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>Security at Home</h3>
			<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
			<p>While promoting international stability can help reduce the longer term terrorist threat, we must also cope with the immediate threat at home. The Madrid bombing of 2004 has shown how vulnerable we are. The military are not at the forefront in the defence against terror attacks at home, although they may have a role in coping with the aftermath of a successful attack. Yet protection of citizens at home is the first priority. This means that any strategy must look at the balance of investment between action abroad and defence at home. Again if no more money is available, this may mean that the urgent needs of local emergency services, police and intelligence may need to draw on wider defence funds.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>When the West was threatened by the Soviet Union, countries came together in a co-operative arrangement &#150; NATO - to provide security at lower cost. With a new common threat, more needs to be done to share the burden and reap the benefits of co-operation. Given the differing views across the Atlantic, and also the non-military aspects of counter-terrorism, it seems more likely that the EU could be used. Deeper EU security co-operation can make us all safer.</p>
