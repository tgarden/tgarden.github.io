<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Strategic Context</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The UK Government moved relatively rapidly
to adjust its defence policy to its perception of the new security
needs after the end of the Cold War. The rush to change its defensive
posture was accelerated by an urgent need to bring an overheated
defence programme back into budgetary balance. Throughout the Cold
War, the UK had taken pride in being a significant player in NATO,
and in spending a higher than  the European average percentage of GDP
on defence. It is a nuclear power, a permanent member of the UN
Security Council, and has a number of security obligations outside of
NATO. It has also had to provide military capability to support the
police in Northern Ireland. During the 1980's, the Prime Minister,
Margaret Thatcher, had supported the NATO pledge for 3% per annum
real growth in defence expenditure, and the UK had met these targets
despite a period of poor economic performance.  This growth rate was
unsustainable and the fall of the Berlin Wall signalled an
opportunity for a strategic review. The UK Government published a
fundamental review of its defence policy in 1990. Combat capability
was set to decline by around 30% over the next 5 years.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The 1990 Review, known as "Options for
Change", was in retrospect  undertaken too early to be based on a
firm understanding of the new security context. It was assumed that a
resurgent Russia had the potential to threaten the West, and that the
traditional UK support for a strong NATO would be the primary
requirement of British Defence Policy. The then Defence Secretary,
Tom King, wrote in April 1990:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">"History shows
that periods of great political upheaval are also likely to be
periods of insecurity. Whilst we look forward to a new security order
in Europe, we have no right to assume it. New arrangements must be
worked at and constructed through patient negotiation and agreement.
NATO provides the focus through which its members in Western Europe
and North America can coordinate and pursue arms control and other
ways of managing international security. But NATO can only succeed if
it can continue to demonstrate a willingness and ability to defend
itself for so long as there remains a potential for military
exploitation in Europe." (1)</FONT></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The British planners adopted with alacrity
the new NATO strategic concept and divided up their remaining forces
into the three required degrees of readiness: rapid reaction, main
defence and augmentation forces. The formation of the multinational
Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC) was
enthusiastically welcomed, and the UK sought and won the lead nation
role. In describing future roles for the British Army (2) NATO
commitments headed the list.  The ARRC  was to be the UK's major
contribution and would be available for "deployment anywhere within
the Allied Command Europe area". (3). Defence of the United Kingdom
and commitments beyond the NATO area completed the three major roles
for British forces. This was a continuation of a policy which saw the
major concern as a threat from the East; albeit one which was now
weaker and less immediate. The UK government, while welcoming the
reunification of Germany, seemed not to be thinking in terms of any
changes to NATO membership. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The assumptions of the 1990 Defence Review
were brought into sharp question by the Gulf War of 1990/91. The UK
had shown that it was prepared to put together a significant joint
force for high intensity warfare well outside the NATO area. The
lessons of the ad hoc coalition building were also a factor in
modifying strategic assumptions. The UK government view was that
engagement of the US was now even more important in the new world
order. The experience of French forces in the Gulf had showed the
importance of membership of the integrated military structure of NATO
in order to be able to play a major role in such deployments. The
lukewarm support for  Gulf  operations from some Allies did not go
unnoticed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	By 1993, the re-emergence of a major
Russian threat was being discounted for the foreseeable future, and
the UK Government was admitting that the assumptions of 1991 were no
longer valid. (4). Better relations with the central European nations
were seen as being achieved through the North Atlantic Co-operation
Council for NATO, and the Forum of Consultation for the Western
European Union. Experience in the former republic of Yugoslavia was
beginning to shape policy thinking on the potential future security
concerns. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The 1994 government's annual defence
policy statement (5) warmly endorsed the outcome of the NATO Brussels
Summit of January that year, and used it as the first opportunity to
trail the longer term possibility of NATO enlargement: </FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">"NATO is also a
focus for stability, valued not only by its members but also by the
newly democratic states of central and eastern Europe. The work of
the North Atlantic Co-operation Council has done much to cement
relations between them and NATO nations....... 'Partnership for
Peace' will deepen the ties between NATO and the central and eastern
European states through close co-operation on a range of military and
political issues and open up the prospect of enlargement of the
Alliance in the longer term."(6)</FONT></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The statement focused more on the threat of
Balkan type conflicts, while reminding the public that the evolution
of Russia was still a cause for concern. The possible enlargement of
NATO was not highlighted in the introduction by the Defence
Secretary, Malcolm Rifkind.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The 1995 statement (7) makes interesting
reading. The Conservative government was inclined more towards the
transatlantic relationship than towards closer integration with
Europe. It saw advantage in promoting enlargement of the European
Union, in the hope that this would delay integration (wider rather
than deeper). However, it could see that a diluting of the membership
of NATO might weaken the bonds that held the United States engaged.
In trying to appear enthusiastic, while preserving the current
arrangements, it said:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">"We place great
value on the concept of partnership, for we seek a balance between
partnership and membership in the development of the wider Europe we 
wish to see. But there is an unhelpful preoccupation with the latter,
and in particular with membership of NATO and the European Union.
Playing down the value of co-operation and playing up the
significance of decisions on membership will risk re-creating the
type of divide in Europe which we wish to avoid."(8)</FONT></I></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">By now the main thrust of defence policy was
attached to wider security policy, and Britain's interests in a
stable world.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The last  annual statement on defence
policy (9) to be produced by the Conservative Government was
published in May 1996, and much of it is coloured by the experience
in Bosnia. The post Cold War change in rationale for defence forces
was virtually complete. The opening statement declares:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">"The goal of our
security policy is to maintain the freedom and territorial integrity
of the United Kingdom and its Dependent Territories, and the ability
to pursue its legitimate interests at home and abroad"
(10)</FONT></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Michael Portillo was the Defence Secretary
and was well known for his lack of enthusiasm for greater integration
of the European Union. In his introduction to the annual statement,
he welcomed the enlargement of NATO and says: "We shall argue
vigorously at the European Union's Inter-Governmental Conference that
European defence arrangements must be based on sustaining NATO's
strength and effectiveness."(11). NATO enlargement is given
prominence for the first time, and the statement reports the outcome
of the NATO study in an objective way (12). There is no discussion of
the issues, or even an indication of the UK Government's view on the
desirability of enlargement. The paper reports that Ministers will
assess progress at the Brussels meeting in December 1996 and consider
the way forward.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">		The British public takes only a limited
interest in defence policy except when a war is in prospect. At a
time when NATO was agonising over its future, little discussion took
place within the UK apart from within the strategic studies elites.
It was perhaps unfortunate that no further defence policy statement
would be produced for two years. The election on 1 May 1997 meant
that the outgoing Conservative government were not able to produce
one. Nor was there much debate on the issues in either chamber of
Parliament. The House of Commons had a brief debate in February 1997
followed by an even shorter debate in the House of Lords the
following month.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">The 1997 Parliamentary Debates</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">		The House of Commons spared an hour and
a half to debate NATO enlargement on 26 February 1997 (13). The
debate was opened by Bill Walker (14), a Conservative member of
parliament, who expressed his reservations about enlargement. He
advocated keeping the current NATO membership strong and ensuring
that the transatlantic bond was not weakened. Members raised the
questions of potential costs, but had little in the way of hard
evidence to work on. The debate did not divide along political party
lines; some Labour and Conservative  members expressed concerns about
the potential weakening of the Alliance through the process of
expansion, while other were broadly supportive. Tony Lloyd, who would
become a foreign office minister in the Labour government, explained
(15) that the Labour party strongly supported NATO and would also
support, with some qualifications, enlargement. The debate was
concluded, without any vote being taken, by the Conservative
government Foreign Office minister, Sir Nicholas Bonsor (16) who
underlined the government's commitment to extending European security
through an enlargement of NATO. In addressing the cost issues, he
suggested that the lower estimates of $35 billion were nearer the
mark than suggestions of $125 billion. In any event, he stated that
the UK government would keep a close eye on costs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">		Two weeks later, the House of Lords,
provided a forum for a discussion of all aspects of NATO enlargement
(17).  On 14 March 1997, (a Friday afternoon when low priority
business is done) Lord Kennet opened the debate by asking the
Government for its policy on the proposal. In a strong opening speech
(18), he expressed great concern about the potential of enlargement
causing a redivision of Europe, an alienation of Russia, and a
remilitarisation of  Europe. He also complained about the lack of
parliamentary debate before the government decided on its policy
towards NATO expansion. In the brief debate, the process of
enlargement had more supporters that opponents. Lord Wallace,
speaking as a Liberal Democrat spokesman, wished to see Slovenia and
Romania include in the first wave of enlargement (19). Many speakers
regretted the lack of public debate about the important strategic
issue of NATO enlargement. They blamed the government for conducting
its policy  development behind closed doors. Lord Williams (20), the
Labour party spokesman, explained that his party supported
enlargement for Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary and possibly
Slovenia, but not for Romania in the first wave. He also highlighted
the importance of working with Russia, and supported the approach
proposed by the United States. Winding up the debate for the
Conservative Government, Lord Chesham (21) did little more than
restate the government's support for the principle of enlargement.
The debate had lasted less than 90 minutes and caused no ripple of
interest among the British public.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">New Labour Government		</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The incoming Labour government had
promised a thorough defence review on gaining power. Although they
had also promised to complete the review within 6 months, it was July
1998 before it was published. This meant that at the key time when
NATO enlargement policy was being shaped, Britain was either
preparing for an election (with its inevitable focus on domestic
issues) or reexamining its whole foreign and defence policy
assumptions for the new government. Even if this had not been the
case, it would have been surprising if the public had become engaged
in the NATO enlargement debate. Public knowledge and interest in NATO
is remarkably low. This is not to say that the British electorate are
antagonistic to NATO. They appear entirely content to leave things as
they are in as much as they know how they are. Defence was not a
significant issue between the parties at the 1997 election. All three
main parties supported a strong NATO with a significant contribution
from Britain.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">		The Labour Party was elected with a 
large majority of the seats in the House of Commons on 1 May 1997. 
There was very little time before the key NATO meeting in Madrid in
July for the development of policy on the key enlargement issues. The
new government had other priorities for reform.  Within two weeks of
taking office, Robin Cook, the new Foreign Secretary, gave a major
briefing on the priorities for British foreign policy. In this
mission statement, he listed four goals of foreign policy, in which
security through NATO was the first:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">"The first goal
of foreign policy is security for nations. Our security will remain
based  on the North Atlantic Alliance. We must manage the enlargement
of NATO to ensure that a wider alliance is also a stronger alliance
and that the process reduces rather than increases tensions between
East and West"(22)</FONT></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	This early statement of support for
enlargement was not followed by any great public discussion. In a
newspaper interview in early June (23), George Robertson, the new
Defence Secretary indicated that the UK favoured full membership for
Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary; had sympathy for the
Slovenian case but was less enthusiastic about Romania as part of the
first wave of new members. The indication was that UK policy on
enlargement was continuing unchanged. The government view was that
enlargement was a good thing, but that it needed to be managed
carefully so as not to cause divisions within NATO and increase
tensions in the rest of Europe. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The outcome of the Madrid summit in July
1997 was as expected by the UK government. Tony Blair reported to
Parliament on 9 July 1997(24). He singled out for particular mention
the position of Slovenia and Romania:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">"I should say a
particular word about Romania and Slovenia, whose applications were
especially closely considered even though there was no consensus to
invite them on this occasion. Both countries have indeed made
remarkable progress. Romania's new Government deserve particular
congratulation on the steps taken since they took office last
November. A number of allies would have liked to see Romania and
Slovenia included among those invited at Madrid. All, including
ourselves, saw them as strong candidates for any future enlargement,
but we felt that Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary were the
limit for current  enlargement." (25)</FONT></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">He dismissed the question of additional
costs as not being significant, and promised that Parliament would
have a full opportunity to debate the enlargement before ratification
of the treaty.  His announcement of the outcome of the Madrid Summit
was welcomed by the leaders of the two main opposition parties.
However, Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, expressed
concern about the lack of a strategy:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">"Does the Prime
Minister accept that there is a necessary but growing divergence
between the long-term strategic aims of the Americans in NATO and the
Europeans in NATO? The Americans see NATO as a global institution,
perhaps with implications for their policy on the middle east, while
we see it as an institution concerned with security in Europe. As an
ad hoc set of decisions, the decisions that were made were sensible;
but they do not yet comprise a strategy, and we need a strategy
urgently." (26)</FONT></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Despite a rebuttal by the Prime Minister,
this has been a recurring theme in the subsequent discussions both
inside and outside parliament. The only critical voices over the
principle of enlargement came from two left wing Labour party
members.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Discussion in the main academic centres
were more critical of the concept of enlargement. Jane Sharp analysed
the UK non-governmental debate in the UK in a study by the Centre for
Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) (27):</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">"In general
British public opinion is unconcerned about NATO enlargement, but
opinions vary widely among the defense and foreign affairs
cognoscenti just as they do in the United States. Among the sceptics,
at one end of the spectrum are Cold Warriors who worry that
enlargement will weaken alliance cohesion and undermine NATO's
original task of collective defence. At the other are those on the
left who worry that taking in central European states formerly under
Soviet control will give Russia a dangerous sense of encirclement
that could strengthen xenophobic nationalists in the Duma and the
military."(28)</FONT></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Certainly for those of us involved in the
academic debate, the anti-expansionists seem to be a significant
majority. Former Ambassadors, senior military officers and
distinguished professors combined at every opportunity to say that
the West's policy was misguided. Letters to the newspapers and
articles on the dangers of expansion were published. The Times had
carried an editorial against expansion:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">"The most urgent
reason for Europeans to rise to the Albright challenge is that the
centrepiece of her European strategy, the enlargement of NATO by
1990, is dangerously misjudged. Far from enhancing the security of
the European continent, this imminent decision risks creating fresh
sources of insecurity, inviting confrontation with Russia and, by
weakening Nato's military credibility, impairing the Alliance's
capacity to respond to new dangers that wiser policies might avert".
(29)</FONT></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Yet the impact on UK policy of these
statements was nil. It may be that the New Labour government, with
its aversion to old national institutions, was peculiarly well placed
to ignore the concerns of this body of great and good.  Their
criticisms were answered in some detail by George Robertson, the
Defence Secretary, in two public speeches in the autumn of 1997
(30).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Defence Committee</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The United Kingdom parliament has a number
of select committees which can shadow particular departments of
state, and have the power to take evidence and produce reports to
parliament. These committees are much weaker than their American
counterparts, but they do provide a useful way of probing the
evolution of government policies. The members of each committee are
themselves elected members of parliament, and are drawn from all
parties in a broadly representative manner. In January 1998, the
Defence Committee began taking evidence about the UK policy on NATO
Enlargement and it published its report (31) in March 1998.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The committee took oral evidence from the
Defence Secretary, the Minister of State at the Foreign Office, from
the Prime Minister of Hungary and from the Defence Minister of
Poland. They also took written submissions from the Embassies of
Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Macedonia,
Poland, Romania, Slovak Republic, and Slovenia.  As with all select
committee investigations, it is open to interested parties to make
submissions. It is significant that there were no such submissions
from interested third parties or non-governmental organisations.  The
report is the most coherent UK document on the issues surrounding the
question of NATO enlargement. It received little publicity and no
public  debate.  The report conclusions (32) in full were:</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">(a) We certainly recognise
the success of the PfP programme, which has also enabled prospective
members to demonstrate their NATO-worthiness. However, we also
recognise that most of the CEE states were not prepared to accept
indefinitely this 'associate status'.</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">(b) We must concur with our predecessor
Committee which commented, "the vital question has since January 1994
been, not whether there will be an extension of NATO, but its pace
and manner".</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">(c) We conclude that the incentive to
improve the structure and control of the military, to enhance
democracy and to resolve border disputes and internal problems with
ethnic minorities, which we have seen clearly exists within aspirant
countries, would not have been as strong without the possibility of
full membership of NATO.</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">(d) We recognise that potential
improvements to the security environment could be put at risk if
enlargement caused Russia to adopt a posture which could bring about
a resurgence of Cold War antagonism.</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">(e) While we should be sensitive to
Russian anxieties, we cannot accept that Russia should have a veto
over Alliance decisions. Nevertheless, we recognise the importance of
continued consultation with Russia and gaining Russian confidence
during the necessarily delicate process of enlargement. In the final
analysis, the central question that must be addressed in deciding on
enlargement is whether it will provide greater security for the
Alliance, and for Europe as a whole.</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">(f) In deciding whether to endorse
ratification of the accession protocols of the proposed new members,
Parliament must weigh the potential political advantages of
enlargement against any potential short-term costs in terms of
military effectiveness. For our part,we are clear that the benefits
of increased stability in central and eastern Europe outweigh any
potential military costs.</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">(g) We conclude that the actual shared
costs of enlargement may well be greater than the $1.5 billion over
ten years projected by NATO, but at this stage it is not possible to
estimate how much with any great certainty.</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">(h) We conclude, that it would be as
well, in choosing to endorse the process of enlargement, to be
prepared for the costs shared among the 19 members of NATO to drift
up at least towards the mid-range between NATO's $1.5 billion over
ten years and the US DoD's $5-6 billion over thirteen
years.</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">(i) We conclude that the weight of
informal opinion and the evidence we have heard supports the RAND
Corporation and DoD in the assumption that the threat of a direct
conventional war in Europe is insignificant in the near
term&emdash;and that should such a threat re-arise, NATO would have
sufficient time to adjust its defensive posture. We accept,
therefore, that the permanent forward positioning of NATO forces in
the new members' territories is unnecessary. To do so when the risk
does not justify it will in any case be interpreted as an action
deliberately antagonistic to Russian concerns. The highest
estimates&emdash;the CBO's more expensive options, at costs of up to
$125 billion&emdash;can accordingly be disregarded.</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">(j) We concur with the view of one of our
Members that "countries can generally achieve a higher degree of
security at lower cost when operating within an Alliance than would
be the case were states to pursue purely national defence
strategies".</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">(k) We cannot share the Secretary of
State's confidence that $1.5 billion represents the probable limit on
the true costs of enlargement.</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">(I) The question that remains is: even if
the costs increase, are the benefits still likely to be worth it?
Even if the UK's estimated contribution of &#163;110 million over ten
years were to double to the equivalent of half of the purchase price
of a Eurofighter every year we would still consider that enlargement
offers excellent value for money </FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">(m) Despite equal or nearly equal claims
from a few other countries, we conclude that none of the three
countries invited to accede to NATO was an inappropriate
choice.</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">(n) We welcome the commitment made by the
Government for a debate in Parliament on NATO enlargement before
ratification.</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">(o) We express the hope that the
Committee on the Modernisation of the House of Commons will turn its
attention to the current unsatisfactory arrangements for
Parliamentary examination of international treaties and other aspects
of the exercise of the royal prerogative in relation to
ratification.</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	While there is no requirement under the
British system for the government to seek parliamentary approval
before ratification of a treaty, the Prime Minister had promised an
opportunity for Parliament to debate NATO enlargement before the UK
ratified. In May 1998, some 23 senior figures, including former
Defence Secretary Denis Healey and two former Chiefs of Defence
Staff, wrote to the Prime Minister to urge a rethink on enlargement
(33). Tony Blair replied robustly  on the decision to offer
membership to the three countries, and also said that the writers'
concerns would be debated in parliament. He was however much less
positive than previously on the question of further
enlargement:</FONT></P>

review was coming to a conclusion and was published in early July
(34). It took as a given assumption that NATO would have three new
members, but did not make any assumptions about further
enlargement.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Ratification Parliamentary
Debates</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	As was described earlier, there is no
requirement for the British Government to take a treaty to parliament
before ratification. Nevertheless, for major changes, it is normal
practice to allow both chambers an opportunity for discussion.
However, the government can be assured of being able to ratify the
treaty. For key issues, a government may decide to conduct a
referendum before entering into a treaty obligation. There was no
suggestion that this was necessary on the issue of NATO enlargement. 
The House of Commons started its debate at 9.37 am on Friday 17
July1998 and had completed its discussion by 11 am that
morning.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The debate was opened by Robin Cook making
a strong statement about the right of the Poland, the Czech Republic
and Hungary as democratic European states to join NATO. He made it
clear that this would increase the UK's commitments but also put
obligations on the new members:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">"The principle of
collective defence still lies at the heart of NATO. Article 5 of the
Washington treaty makes an attack on one NATO member an attack on
all. It is the strongest possible guarantee of our security, and
sends the clearest possible message to anyone with designs on the
territory or freedom of action of a NATO member. The three new
members of NATO will enjoy that guarantee; they will accept, too, the
responsibility that it imposes on them. We will help to defend
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic; they will help to defend us.
The principle of collective defence will not be weakened by the
expansion of NATO's numbers. On the contrary, the capability to
deliver on that principle will be strengthened by the increase in
numbers and the greater security of our present borders."
(37)</FONT></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	In his speech, he also described the
process by which the applicant countries were narrowed down to three.
He admitted that the UK would have supported Slovenia, but that
consensus among the 16 NATO nations was necessary.</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">"It was no easy
decision to choose which among so many applicant countries should be
successful. The consensus that emerged from long discussion in Madrid
was that they should be the three countries that we are debating.
Critical to that judgment was the broad view that NATO enlargement
should proceed at a pace that is consistent with NATO absorbing its
expanded membership. We would do no service to the other countries
that aspire to join NATO if we expanded so rapidly that NATO lost its
effectiveness as the military guarantor of peace on our continent. As
I have said, this will not be the last NATO enlargement. No one
should be under any illusion about the magnitude of the current
enlargement."(38)</FONT></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	On the subject of additional costs, he
assessed the UK contribution to be as low as &#163;110 million spread
over 10 years. In his response, John Maples, the Conservative party
defence spokesman expressed concern about the rigour of the cost
assessment. He also spent some time discussing the effect on Russia
and the difficulties of extending NATO's security guarantee
effectively to the enlarged area. When asked whether he supported the
proposed enlargement or not he said:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">"We fully support
the accession of the three new members, but it will be a significant
task to integrate them into NATO's military structure, and that must
be substantially completed before there is any further expansion. We
should be cautious about having more new members until it is clear
how the situation in central and eastern Europe is developing. Almost
all the countries that want to join fail at least one of the tests
that I set out earlier.</FONT></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">NATO has an enormous current agenda without
further enlargement: the integration of the three new members;
developing a new strategic concept; and building relationships with
Russia and its former allies. Those are all significant tasks which
will take much effort and time. Let us ensure that they are concluded
satisfactorily before proceeding any further."(39)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The next main speaker was Bruce George,
the Chairman of the Defence Select Committee. He brought the
conclusions of his committee's analysis to the attention of the House
and strongly endorsed the proposed enlargement of NATO. He made it
clear that the costs to the UK were well worth paying. The debate
(such as it was) closed with only one further speaker. As a number of
members noted in their interventions, it was a very cursory way for
the UK parliament to consider such a significant change to the
strategic landscape in Europe. There was less than two hour's of
discussion on a Friday morning, when the House of Commons is
traditionally poorly attended. Despite the lack of need for a
parliamentary vote, the UK was among the last of the NATO member
states to formally ratify.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	On the final afternoon of the
parliamentary session before the long summer break of 1998, the House
of Lords discussed NATO enlargement. (40).  The debate was opened by
Lord Gilbert, the minister for defence procurement. He reminded the
House (41) that he had opposed enlargement in 1996 as he had worried
about undermining NATO through unrestrained enlargement. he had also
been concerned about the costs. He had changed his mind because the
process after the Madrid Summit had been well considered and each
applicant had been examined on its merits. He also believed that the
costs were now affordable. Lord Wallace, the Liberal Democrat
spokesman said:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">"We should be
developing and setting out publicly our own approach both to a
domestic audience and to our allies in Europe and across the
Atlantic.The Minister referred to consensus. It is never necessary to
take a vote in NATO. It is an open secret that the majority of NATO
members were in favour of enlargement to include five members on this
occasion, of whom two were Romania and Slovenia, which would have
solved the problem of Hungary as a land-locked state not having
access. But the Americans said firmly and conclusively that they did
not think they could get more than three through the Senate.
Therefore on this occasion "consensus" meant a minority ruling the
roost. NATO will not develop into a toothless security organisation
as the Minister suggested so long as it has an effective European
pillar.How much further should the alliance expand? The US Senate
passed effectively a resolution suggesting that there should be a
pause before further expansion. That seems to me to be a mistake. We
must maintain the momentum at least to include Romania and Slovenia
next time round. There are much larger questions over the Baltic
states. To discuss the question of when and if the Baltic states come
into NATO is necessarily to discuss Baltic and European security as a
whole and how Sweden and Finland see their relations with
NATO."(42)</FONT></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The debate took as given that enlargement
would happen and centred more on the longer term future of NATO. Not
only was the question of the relationship with Russia seen as
important, but a number of speakers were concerned about the
potential differences between European and American perspectives.
Lord Kennet, who had been a critic of enlargement, said:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">"What in fact do
we, the current European members of NATO, want for NATO? And what
does the United States want for NATO? Unfortunately, that is not the
same thing. What each wants is fast becoming incompatible with the
other."(43)</FONT></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Lord Carver, a former army Chief of the
Defence Staff, argued strongly against the whole enlargement process
on the grounds that it redivided Europe into two potentially hostile
camps. The discussion was characterised by thoughtful and well
informed analysis of the issues.As is often the case with debates in
the Lords, it received no publicity in the media. The final speech
was made by Baroness Symons, the Foreign Office minister (44). She
made no commitment for either time or candidates for further
enlargement, but said that the door remained open. Her concluding
words announced the Government's intention to ratify:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">"Following this
debate the Government will deposit notifications of acceptance of the
enlargement protocols with the United States Government in Washington
in accordance with our obligations under the Washington Treaty. We
expect a formal joining ceremony to take place when heads of state
and government meet in Washington on 24th and 25th April 1999 which
is also the celebration of 50 years of NATO's history. In
anticipation of that event I hope that the whole House will join me
in welcoming the Czech Republic,Hungary and Poland to the NATO
alliance."(45)</FONT></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Current British Position</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	As we have seen, official opinion in the
UK has moved from almost giving a promise to Slovenia and Romania
that they were next in line for NATO membership to much vaguer
assurances of the door remaining open. In a major speech (46) on NATO
in early 1999, Robin Cook made no reference to further enlargement.
On the official Ministry of Defence web site, the section on NATO
enlargement made it clear that the UK was not pushing for further
enlargement to be decided at the Washington Summit in April
1999:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">"Enlargement is a
long-term process, closely related to wider developments in NATO and
in Europe as a whole. It requires a consensus of all NATO members.
The Washington Summit will not therefore necessarily issue any
invitations to begin accession negotiations.</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">The UK Government is committed to the
continuation of the enlargement process, guided by the following
factors:</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">	</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">	* the readiness of individual
candidates</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">	* the readiness of NATO to absorb new
members</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">	* the effects on overall European 
security"  (47)</FONT></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Again there has been virtually no public
or parliamentary debate about further enlargement. Officials make it
clear that it has been hard work to prepare the three new members,
particularly at a time when NATO has had a heavy operational load to
bear. Now that those who had pushed for the original enlargement seem
prepared to wait, the critics of the enlargement process are also
content to keep quiet. The roles and purpose of NATO, to be distilled
in the new Strategic Concept, are where staff work is most active.
The challenges of European Union enlargement are becoming clearer,
and the elite debates have focused more on the implications in this
area.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	To many non-British commentators, the lack
of interest in the whole adventure of NATO enlargement will seem
surprising. Traditionally, all mainstream political opinion has been
supportive of NATO. There are few votes to be won by making NATO an
issue in the country. The elites, both within government and outside,
seek ways to manage the transition of NATO  to the new post Cold War
world. The debates, such as they are, have been about how this can
best be done. Given the lack of political dogma, the UK has seen
itself in the role of being able to broker consensus between the US
view and that of the other main European players. That it could not
bring the French back into the integrated military structure at
Madrid was seen as unfortunate. For the future, the UK can be
expected to  wish to play a continuing role as a pragmatic member of
NATO. There are however signs that this may become more difficult as
thinking about security on either side of the Atlantic diverges.
