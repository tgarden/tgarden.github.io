<P>Killing, maiming, torturing, starving and raping children remains
wrong even when there is a war on. This is not just liberal opinion:
the world community has endorsed this view through an enormous and
complex set of international law, which is neither well known nor
properly enforced. Dr Kuper was for many years a solicitor with the
Children's Legal Centre in London, and worries that her book may read
too much like the PhD thesis from which it is drawn. There is no need
for such concerns. The enormity of the misery suffered by child
victims of armed conflict is brought home to the reader, time and
time again, in the carefully documented pages. UNICEF estimates that
2 million children have been killed in armed conflict around the
world in the last decade; and a further 4 to 5 million have been
disabled. In Rwanda in 1994, the number of children killed that year
was probably more than 250,000. Nor are these statistics always about
far off places: in the former Yugoslavia by the end of 1993 over
15,000 children had been killed, and more than 35,000 wounded in the
fighting.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Dr Kuper has brought together all the treaties, conventions, laws,
protocols, declarations and instruments that have a bearing on the
position of child civilians in armed conflict. For the international
law professional, this would be reason enough to have a copy. For
those involved in planning and carrying out military operations, the
special position of the child in war needs to be better known. As
soldiers find themselves operating more and more in UN sponsored
operations, they will need to make sure they understand all of the
rules.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Many of these rules have been developed by the UN. As the 1959
Declaration of the Rights of the Child affirms "Mankind owes to the
child the best it has to give". The negotiating processes for the
relevant Articles of International Humanitarian Law seem at times to
lose sight of mankind's duty. Working Groups argued heatedly over
whether States would be obliged to take all necessary measures to
prevent children under 18 taking part in hostilities. They settle in
the end for taking all feasible measures for those under 15. But does
the wording matter if monitoring and enforcement are ineffective?
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>To assess the effectiveness of this body of law in practice, three
recent conflicts are described. They all involve Iraq, but the
lessons would apply equally well in Somalia, Rwanda, Angola, Algeria,
the former Yugoslavia or Chechnya.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The use of chemical weapons against Iraqi Kurds in 1987 and 1988
has some stark well documented violations of the Rights of the Child.
In just one attack in one village on 16 April 1987, 76 children aged
between one day and eight years died from mustard gas. By 1988, the
far more effective toxic nerve gases were employed. The photographs
of the results of the attack on Halajaba with some 6000 deaths
brought this terror to the attention of the world. I recall deep
diplomatic displeasure being shown in London by the limiting of
official attendance at Iraqi social functions. The second conflict,
in which children suffered greatly, was during the occupation of
Kuwait and the 1991 Gulf War. There was terrible carnage inflicted
both by Iraq on Kuwaiti children and by the US-led alliance attacks
on Iraq. Finally, the suppression of uprisings in Iraq after the Gulf
War led to a mass exodus of Kurdish refugees in the North and brutal
crushing of Shia in the South. Millions of Kurds fled North and the
world was shown bleak mountains packed with starving families. The
numbers become difficult to comprehend, but one US agency records
6700 refugees (most children under 5) perishing in mountain camps
along the Turkish border over a period of two months.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>While the international community condemned the outrages of war in
all these conflicts, there is little indication that the special
place of the child in international law was even acknowledged. Dr
Kuper offers ways to enhance the effectiveness of the law, but admits
that it is likely to remain inadequately observed. Nevertheless, the
first step is making sure that those in government and in the
military know what is required of them. At the end of her litany of
death and destruction, she rightly concludes that the work is
worthwhile if it results in even one child being spared death or
injury.</P>
