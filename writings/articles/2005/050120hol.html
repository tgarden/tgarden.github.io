			<p>My Lords, I congratulate the European Union sub committee C for their work in putting together the excellent report on the EU security strategy. The strategy has received almost no publicity in the UK, and that is a great pity. I doubt that there are many of our citizens who are aware that all member states of the EU signed up in December 2003 to a statement of their common view of the future security challenges. For once, it is an EU document which is short, well written and understandable.</p>
			<p>I watched the development of the EU strategy paper through 2003 with close attention, and was delighted that the final agreed version was not watered down too much from the original Solana draft. In the academic world, we have tended to compare and contrast &nbsp;this EU strategy with the US National security strategy, which was &nbsp;published in September 2002. While the EU strategy paper is shorter and more schematic, it identifies most of the same key challenges. Indeed in one respect, that of drawing attention to the threat from organised crime, it goes further than the US document.</p>
			<p>The committee report, both in its content and in the evidence session, shows an entirely reasonable concern about the implications for the transatlantic relationship. Given the commonality of&nbsp; threat assessment between the EU and the US, we ought to be able to do better. The difference arises in the analysis over the strategy to meet these threats. The events leading to the unfortunate intervention in Iraq provided a topical and vivid example of the difference in approach. Para 16 of the report asks for clarification of whether the EU strategy includes pre-emptive action. Having watched the development of the strategy, I think it is clear that it does not. While the US strategy advocates pre-emptive action to forestall possible future hostile acts, the EU strategy looks to preventive engagement.</p>
			<p>These differences are more than semantics. They lead to some of the inhibitions between NATO and EU co-operation, which is also an area of concern in the sub committee&rsquo;s report. I must report to your lordships that my recent visits to fora for NATO and for European Security and Defence Policy suggest that there is a real problem of communication between NATO and the EU. Indeed, I think that all the exciting policy development has now moved across town in Brussels away from NATO, and that the EU is enthusiastically looking at ways to develop its security capabilities.</p>
			<p>Since the evidence was taken in March of last year, there have been developments in both organisations. In NATO we have seen the difficulties in obtaining practical support from member nations for the agreed force levels in Afghanistan. The relatively undemanding agreement over providing training for Iraqi security forces has also moved very slowly. The much trumpeted NATO Response Force is taking on a role as the stop gap reserve rather than the leading edge deployment.</p>
			<p>But in the EU, we have seen the take over of the Bosnia task, the development of the battle groups, and the establishment and building up of the European Defence Agency, under the leadership of the UK&rsquo;s Nick Whitney. There is an air of things happening again in European defence after the tetchy days of Iraq disputes. I trust that the UK government has also rediscovered its enthusiasm, which had seemed to wane. The security strategy is a good starting point as the committee says.</p>
			<p>The Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington brought together 13 former senior retired military officers from NATO nations last year in an initiative for a&nbsp; renewed transatlantic partnership. They included General Ralston, a former vice Chairman of the US joint chiefs, and General Naumann, the former Chairman of the NATO Military Committee. Two members of your Lordships house also signed the final joint declaration: the noble and gallant Lord Boyce and myself. We all concluded that European countries must move quickly to acquire the military capabilities that will enable them to share responsibility for global security. In order to do that, we must move forward with a greater degree of defence integration in Europe. In the implementation of the EU security strategy, this difficult political issue will have to be addressed.</p>
			<p>I was particularly pleased to see that the subcommittee C highlighted in its recommendations at Chapter 5, the need to develop and commit funding for the policies. It is only with common funding that we will be able to share the task appropriately, and make progress in rationalising and developing common capabilities. I do not believe that the Government in its response to the report has shown sufficient imagination in this area. Equating the provision of bits of military capability with common funding misses the point. So long as we have voluntary force contributions, there will be no development of high end enabling capabilities, and the problem of the free rider will continue.</p>
			<p>The Government response to the report also addresses some of the non-military aspects of EU security policy. This is an important area, where the EU has a comparative advantage over NATO and even the US. I am encouraged by this, and trust the UK will play a full part in extending the EU&rsquo;s ability to provide civil support for conflict prevention and the building of civil society in fragile states.</p>
			<p>It has been a good year so far for the EU. . European A380 Airbus shows what Europe can do on its own. The extraordinary&nbsp; landing on Titan by the European Space Agency Huygens probe showed what we can do in a transatlantic partnership. The committee rightly concluded we do need to work with the US, but that does not mean we have to tackle the global security problem in the American way. As the EU strategy says: &ldquo;As a union of 25 states with over 450 million people producing a quarter of the world&rsquo;s GNP, the European Union is inevitably a global actor&#x2026; it should be ready to share in the responsibility for global security and in building a better world.&rdquo; From these benches we commend the government for signing up to that policy on behalf of the UK, and also congratulate the Committee for its work in monitoring the delivery behind the promises.</p>
