			<p><b>Doing less with less: making Britain more secure</b></p>
			<p><b>Paul Robinson</b></p>
			<p><b>Published by Imprint Academic 2005, 102pp, &pound;8.95</b></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>It is stimulating to review a book on UK defence policy that claims in its title that we can increase security by doing less in the defence field. This must be the dream of every Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the question is whether Dr Robinson of the University of Hull has found the magic formula. The slim volume reviews current defence policy, explains what is wrong with it&nbsp; both from a philosophical and a practical aspect, and then says what needs to be done. All this is covered in 63 brief pages, and&nbsp; the argument is therefore more a series of assertions; although the reader is supposed to draw supporting evidence from the appendices which follow.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Robinson lays out his thesis in his introduction: &quot;Military interventionism is neither necessary for Briatin's defence, nor even beneficial to it. On the contrary, it undermines our security, and imposes undesirable cost on our nation. We should do less.&quot; He argues that the intervention in Iraq was the logical conclusion of the post Cold War defence policy, and is the exemplar for all that is wrong with our approach. He identifies two events as setting us off on the wrong path. The first was the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and the second was the terror attack on the United States in 2001. Unfortunately, he does not examine what alternatives the UK should have taken in each case if intervention was inappropriate. When Iraq broke international law by invading Kuwait, the international community was unified in the need for action. Would it have been right for the UK to decline to join with other nations in ousting the invaders? And following the attacks of 9/11, the world again joined together to condemn the outrage. and to authorise the intervention in Afghanistan. Under the Robinson approach to defence, we would have confined our international action to rhetoric.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>It is of course the intervention in Iraq in 2003, which drives much of the author's approach. While it is easy for some&nbsp; to agree that there was a major foreign policy blunder, it is less easy to support his view that we became involved merely because we had an interventionist capability. Given the views of the Blair Government, we would presumably have been involved with whatever we had available on the day. Merely drawing down expeditionary force capability would only have changed the scale of the capabilities that were deployed.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>I doubt that many readers of the RUSI Journal will be convinced by Robinson's view of&nbsp; a non-interventionist military capability. However, before coming to a judgement, it is worth looking at the force structure that he advocates, and his calculation of resource implications. He explains that one could use the arguments in the book as a basis for eliminating the armed forces almost entirely. Indeed that seemed to be where he was pointing the reader.&nbsp; However in a chapter entitled &quot;The Precautionary Principle&quot;, he says: &quot;But experience teaches us that the world does often take unexpected turns for the worse. There is some benefit in practising a bit of caution&quot;. How true.&nbsp; From this point, the discussion becomes one with which RUSI Journal readers will be familiar. Can we afford two aircraft carriers? How much heavy armour do you need to keep by in case? What is a sensible buy for Typhoon? Shall we replace Trident?&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>His cost benefit analysis is necessarily brief and adds little to the sum of human knowledge. He offers the suggestion of perhaps smaller aircraft carriers, without explaining how they fit into his non-interventionist strategy. Because our submarines now have a land offensive capability, he suggests that they might be kept but returned to anti-submarine hunting duties.&nbsp; Such savings as there were, would go on the surface fleet because &quot;there is always a need to protect civilian shipping on the high seas&quot;.&nbsp; For the RAF he advocates a fleet of 90 Typhoons, without showing why that is the appropriate number for his strategy. He concludes that deciding what is cut and what increased is less important than establishing the principle of a non-interventionist policy. He believes that the force structure will flow from that change of policy.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>If I have been critical of the rigour of the arguments, that does not mean that this is a book to be ignored. Its brevity makes it an easy read. Robinson's criticisms of the lack of logic within our current published defence policy need to be answered. The reader does not have to buy in to his philosophy to know that we have considerable incoherence between stated policy and actual practice. As the recent NAO report on operational effectiveness has shown, we are reducing the readiness of our power projection capability in order to sustain our forces, which are currently engaged on post-conflict operations. Yet at the same time, the future equipment programme is all about new exciting warfighting hardware. Dr Robinson asks some questions which need answers.</p>
