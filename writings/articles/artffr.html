<P>One of the bonuses of turning government departments into agencies
has been the great improvement in the presentation of their printed
products. The Central Statistical Office has certainly produced an
attractive glossy commercial paperback in a format which could
attract the more general reader. The book is a revised edition of
their 1951 Statistical Digest of the War, and has been produced to
mark the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. To
bring some life to the series of tables of statistics, Dr Peter
Howlett provides a very short introductory commentary to each
chapter. His text is illustrated with evocative photographs of the
nation at home during the war.</P>

<P>Reviewing a collection of statistical tables has its difficulties.
The accuracy of the figures, within the constraints of the carefully
footnoted definitions, are almost certainly as good as is possible.
The commentary is worthy and draws attention to the trends revealed
by the tables. There is material to stimulate follow-up investigation
in countless directions. The problem is that for all the glossy
presentation, the use of two colour printing, the high quality paper,
the couple of graphs at the start of each chapter and a foreword by
Churchill's Private Secretary, Anthony Montague Browne, the tables of
figures lack life. The book would be much better if it provided the
data on computer disk with a suitable graphical program to allow
comparative statistics to be created. For any who have not seen the
power of such a format, I recommend strongly 3D Atlas on CD-Rom by
Electronic Arts. Here statistical data for all of the countries in
world can be compared, manipulated and displayed. In under a minute,
you can display the trend in relative production of Aluminium and
Copper in the UK over the last 15 years, and then compare that with
the trend in any other country. To do the same operation for 1939 to
1945 would require the extraction of each set of figures from the
tables in the book (which are presented in different formats), and
then the calculations and the plotting. Obviously the Central
Statistical Office realises the potential of computer accessible
tables as the inside cover informs us that they provide a wide range
of data on disk. The very helpful man at the end of the telephone
number given regretted that his data on disk did not extend to
Fighting with Figures.</P>

<P>Despite all these drawbacks, the casual reader cannot help but
stumble over fascinating insights into this unique period of British
history. The extraordinary growth in production of aircraft is well
known, but the steady decline in performance of the coal industry
shows another side to the national effort. Indeed the table showing
industrial stoppages indicates a less than happy work force on the
home front. The chapter on social conditions is full of detail about
health, pensions, crime and house building. It appears that a decline
in the police force numbers was matched by a decline in offences. As
always in such a collection there are statistics which are surprising
by their absence. While we can examine month by month the consumption
of manganese ore, there are no statistics about schools or
universities. Indeed the only reference to Education is in the global
figure for Central Government expenditure, where it is lumped
together with Broadcasting. All in all, there are probably more
worthwhile commemorative publications to be had at the price.</P>
