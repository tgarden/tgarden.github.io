<P>For the past half century, all our lives have been affected by the
outcome of a single bombing mission that took place on 6 August 1945
in the closing days of World War 2. The Enola Gay dropped the first
operational atomic bomb over Hiroshima. As the early morning
commuters emerged from their air raid shelters, the aircraft was
passing out of sight. Its 12 kiloton bomb was descending slowly by
parachute to detonate only when it reached 1900 feet above the centre
of the city. At 8.15, about 83,000 people died, another 53,000 were
injured and 25 square miles of the city vanished. Three days later,
Nagasaki suffered a similar fate, and, on 15 August , Emperor
Hirohito broadcast his decision to negotiate for peace. Despite a
continuing debate about the morality of nuclear weapons, most people
believe that the nuclear destruction of two Japanese cities at least
brought the war to a more rapid end, and thus saved the lives of
perhaps a million American soldiers. Conventional bombing in Dresden
and Tokyo had been more destructive, but had not been as decisive.

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Hiroshima's Shadow is a book which convincingly questions these
widely held beliefs. It is an astonishing volume. The contributors
include six Nobel Prize winners, politicians, scientists, historians
and those who survived the attacks. The key documentation from the
period is reprinted. It is beautifully edited to produce a story
which grips the reader from start to finish. In his introduction,
Joseph Rotblat remembers the good intentions of his fellow Manhattan
Project scientists. They were racing to produce an atomic weapon
before Germany so that they might deter a Nazi atomic attack. He
recounts his horror at a dinner conversation with General Leslie
Groves, the project director, who believed that the real purpose of
their work was ultimately to subdue the Soviets. By the end of 1944,
it was clear that the Germans had failed and had abandoned their
atomic weapon project. Rotblat declined to continue work on the bomb,
and left the team. After a lifetime of trying to reduce the risks of
nuclear war, he received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1995.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The first section of the book examines whether it was necessary to
continue to develop the bomb and then use it against Japanese cities
in order to shorten the war. While we cannot know how alternative
histories would have played out, there is a surprising amount of
evidence as to what the decision-makers really thought at the time.
Without the determination and drive of General Groves, the bomb would
not have been ready to test on 16 July 1945, which was the first day
of the Potsdam Summit. President Truman could now afford to move
slowly on encouraging Stalin to enter the war against Japan. From the
recently declassified intercepts of the Japanese diplomatic
telegrams, we can see that Truman was aware that the Japanese were
close to surrender. By mid July, the only sticking point was the
status of the Emperor after surrender.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Truman had delayed the summit to allow time for the atomic test.
At Potsdam, the requirement for unconditional surrender by the
Japanese was maintained, and the entry of the Soviet Union into the
war was agreed. On 8 August, the Japanese Ambassador in Moscow asked
for a meeting with Foreign Affairs Commissar Molotov with a view to
seeking mediation for a ceasefire. Before he could start, Molotov
read out the Soviet declaration of war. The Russian tanks were
crossing the Manchurian border within a few hours. The next day, the
Japanese war council met in Tokyo to discuss the options for
surrender terms. As they were talking, a different (plutonium based)
atomic bomb was being dropped on Nagasaki. The war council could not
agree on their minimum conditions for a ceasefire. The divided views
were presented to Emperor Hirohito, who made it clear that they must
accept the terms of the Potsdam Declaration. His Minister of War
helped draft the script for Hirohito's broadcast, and then went home
to commit suicide.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>From the evidence, it seems clear that the use of the two atomic
bombs contributed to the rapidity of the surrender, but that the
entry of the Soviets into the war was probably the major factor. In
any event, the decision to negotiate a ceasefire had already been
taken by the Japanese before they knew of either the atomic threat or
the Soviet intentions. The book moves on from the story behind the
ending of the war to examine how history has been rewritten. There
were many reasons for pressing on with the Manhattan Project after
Germany fell. So much money and effort had been invested and it was
clear that post war relations with the Soviet Union were not going to
be easy. Yet the public rationale for the use of the atomic bomb on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki was explicitly based on the argument that it
had ended the war earlier and at less cost in human lives.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>After the war, President Truman promoted the idea that, but for
the atom bomb, an invasion of Japan would have been needed, and that
it would have cost the lives of half a million US soldiers. Winston
Churchill inflated this estimate to 1,200,000 allied lives. Yet the
official papers of the time show that the military planners were
working on expected casualties in the range 20,000 to 46,000.
Professor Bernstein, who contributes the evidence for this great
disparity in his chapter, concludes that Truman probably eventually
came to believe his own myth.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The second part of the book examines how a consensus view was
developed in the immediate post war period. Henry Stimson, the
wartime secretary of war, published a key article in Harper's
Magazine in 1947 on how the decision to use atomic bomb was made. The
orchestration of this and other authoratative essays was done by
Harvard's president, James Conant, who saw it as vital to rebut
criticisms about the use of these weapons. There were hopes at the
time that an international control regime for atomic weapons might be
agreed with the Soviets under the Baruch plan. Conant believed that
this was more likely to be achieved if the United States was not
having to deal with internal sentimental criticism over its use of
atomic weapons against civilians.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>There were those who questioned the decision to use the bomb, and
the book devotes a section to what the editors call "The First
Critics". Mahatma Gandhi and Albert Camus join a number of thoughtful
commentators who worry about the morality of such weapons, and the
implications for the future. These articles, produced so soon after
the first experience of nuclear weapons, are remarkably prescient.
The inevitability that America would come to fear nuclear attack from
its enemies in the future was already clear to many of the writers.
Yet their dissenting views both on the morality and on the longer
term implications of Hiroshima did not affect the American
perspective over the years.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Fifty years later, the Enola Gay was to be the centrepiece of a
commemorative display at the Smithsonian Museum in Washington.
Joining the Wright Brothers flying machine and rocks picked up by the
first astronauts on the moon, the first nuclear bomber was to be
shown at the National Air and Space Museum. Anyone who has been to
the Smithsonian will know that it is a temple to the proud
achievements of America. It is also a serious research institution,
and the exhibit was to be accompanied by the history of the process
which led to the aircraft's bombing mission, examples of the
destruction caused and the effect on the Cold War subsequently. This
would not appear contentious to most British readers. Yet passionate
attacks on the project came almost immediately from a number of
different American sources. The Washington Post characterised the
proposed display as "an anti-nuke morality play in which Americans
were portrayed as ruthless racists hell-bent on revenge for Pearl
Harbor". Other editorials picked up the theme, and Air Force veteran
associations and the American Legion made sure that Congressmen were
left in no doubt that the Museum was promoting anti-American
propaganda. General Paul Tibbets, the original pilot of the Enola
Gay, suggested that the display should simply be the aircraft with a
label which read "This airplane was the first one to drop an atomic
bomb". When the much truncated display was opened on 28 June 1995, it
was claimed that "the aircraft speaks for itself".</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>This battle between American patriotism and historical accuracy
claimed one casualty. The Director of the Museum, Dr Martin Harwitt
resigned under congressional pressure. Yet those who wished to
eliminate all the horrors of Hiroshima from the display awoke an
interest in the historical truth. Hiroshima's Shadow is written to
provide that truth. The reader is drawn back from the academic
disputes in modern times to read the memories of those who were in
Hiroshima in August 1945. Wilfred Burchett, an Australian war
correspondent, tells the story of how he managed to smuggle himself
into the city after the attack, and what he saw. His uncensored
report, sent by morse code to the Daily Express, told of the
continuing deaths from an atomic plague (radiation sickness). He was
not a popular reporter with the American authorities.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>It is always exciting to find a book which challenges the reader's
assumptions. This is a book which has changed my views about the
history of the decision to use atomic weapons against Japan. The
evidence appears clearly to support the view that President Truman
and a number of his key advisers were more concerned about the coming
power struggle with the Soviet Union than with the speedy defeat of
Japan. This is an important distinction, but does not necessarily
make Truman's decision wrong. We now know that nuclear weapons would
have been developed by the Soviets whatever had happened. It may be
that the experience of the horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were
necessary for nuclear deterrence to operate throughout the Cold War.
If the atomic bomb had not first been used in Japan, it would
probably have been used in the Korean War with less predictable
consequences. Certainly, the unique and awful power of the atom bomb
was never in any doubt afterwards.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Bird and Lifschultz have produced a great work which should be
read by everyone who cares about historical truth, the morality of
war and the workings of government. The book is remarkably low priced
for such quality of production. It is a book to own.</P>
