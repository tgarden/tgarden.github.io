			<h3>NATO, EU and Eastern Europe</h3>

		<h4>Where is Eastern Europe?</h4>
		<p>Speaking at the home of the Russian and East European Institute, Polish studies and Institute for Asian Studies, I had better define my geography for this presentation before I manage to upset all the experts in the audience. For my purpose, I shall take Eastern Europe as encompassing everywhere on the European continent that does not have full membership of the EU or NATO (with the exception perhaps of Switzerland). I realise that this is a geographically inaccurate definition, but the problems faced by those outside the magic circles of these two major players have common features, and the handling of them by the West has to be considered as a whole.</p>
		<h4>Why Care about the future of NATO?</h4>
		<p>I seem to have spent the last five years going to a succession of conferences, workshops and seminars addressing the problems of European Security in general and the future of NATO and the EU in particular. This could at one level seem rather curious. With the end of the Cold War and the rapid move towards democratic government and market economies throughout central and eastern Europe, one ought to be able say that the prospects for a stable European continent have never been better. Certainly there is for once no immediate threat of war across the continent - and that is an unusual state. In the past, Europe has been a source of both instability and conflict. The two most destructive prolonged and geographically extended wars of this Century began in the centre of Europe, as you in America know only too well. The post-War peace in Europe was bought only at the price of the continuous threat of a possible third even more destructive war. &nbsp; <br>
			&nbsp;<br>
			By the end of the Cold War, part of Western Europe had made considerable progress, along a route of economic interdependence, towards making armed conflict unthinkable between fellow members of the European Union. The Common Market was an excellent example of an institution which has been a successful conflict prevention mechanism. The development of common economic interests, with a system of rules and laws common to member nations, has led to an entity, within which war has been relegated to the near impossible. This process continues as the EU develops, and as it looks at its scope for a common European security identity. In parallel, the success of NATO since its foundation has been not just in its role as a collective security alliance, but also as a mechanism for building confidence between members and preventing conflicts between members. &nbsp; </p>
		<h4>Concerns in the Transition Period</h4>
		<p>So why is there so much angst recently about future European security? Despite the end of the years of nuclear confrontation, and the absence of any significant feeling of military threat in Western Europe, it is clear that we are in the midst of a transition period, when decisions are being made that will profoundly affect the future of not just European security, but have long-term world-wide repercussions. The two parallel, but distinct, activities which are coming to a head are the changes in NATO and for the European Union. NATO has made a start on enlarging its membership to the East with the accession of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic in April 1999. The EU agreed in Nice in December 2000 to move forward with a process of enlargement that may take it from 15 member states to double that number.<br>
			&nbsp;<br>
			There have been, and there are, other organisations which have an impact on European security, but the contribution that the EU and NATO have made to the elimination of conflict between member states is of a different order. For this reason, when looking to European security issues of the future, it is these two organisation which are the starting point. Future security predictions can only be made in the context of assumptions about the way in which both NATO and the EU are likely to develop. </p>
		<h4>What are the Security Problems?</h4>
		<p>There are a number of current and future security concerns for Europe. All States have a concept that they define as their vital national interest. This will certainly include the survival of the State itself, but will also include the preservation of its territorial integrity and the defence of its airspace and surrounding waters. European states will continue to examine whether there is any potential external threat to their individual vital interests. The mechanism for defining a European collective vital interest is not yet properly developed, but this might be expected to emerge in the coming years. Many in Western Europe will take the view that there is no such threat at present, but that there may be future potential problems. The future of Russia will be a major factor in this analysis. While Russia now has neither the capability (with the exception of nuclear forces) or inclination to pose a direct threat to Western European nations, it is still of concern to its nearer neighbours, and could remilitarise to pose a wider threat in the future under certain circumstances. The future of China is also a factor in the longer term. Some other countries, which are potentially hostile to western liberal democracies, may be developing a strategic delivery capability, which could provide the threat of attack using weapons of mass destruction.<br>
			<br>
			Russia is not the only possible source of concern for territorial integrity. Pressures of population and economic need, particularly from the North African states, may lead to mass migration northwards to European States. This is a different form of invasion from the use of armed forces, but is a potential source of conflict. The Middle East remains a source of potential conflict.<br>
			<br>
			Territorial disputes remain, and are likely to become more intense as environmental pressures increase. Water, fishing and minerals can all lead to conflict. The geography of Europe offers many opportunities for experts in international law to earn their money in boundary disputes. In particular Turkey and Greece have shown continuing hostility over territorial limits around the many islands in their neighbouring coasts. There is also the continuing problem over the partition of Cyprus.<br>
			<br>
			Ethnic disputes are not new to Europe, but the growing acceptance by the international community of a philosophy of ethnic self-determination is a potential cause for much new disputation. The experience gained in the break up of Yugoslavia has shown that the strength of feeling among ethnic groups can still lead to conflict which cannot be ignored by neighbouring states. If this presages a development towards more of Europe's ethnic groups seeking realignment of national boundaries, and fragmentation of states, there will be no lack of potential causes for conflict. Such bids for ethnic self-determination can be a threat to the survival of the state. However as the division of Czechoslovakia has shown, it is possible for states to divide without conflict. We still have the problem of piecing together the fragments of Yugoslavia.<br>
			&nbsp;<br>
			A key security issue that is directly relevant to Europe's interests is the future relationship with the United States. For the post-War period, Western Europe has depended greatly on the direct involvement of the United States in its security. That involvement has been guaranteed through NATO. With the demise of the Soviet Union, the United States has taken on the role of world policeman, even if it has at times been reluctant to do so.</p>
		<h4>Internal National Security Concerns</h4>
		<p>In addition to the vital interests of European states, there will continue to be a range of national security concerns to be taken into account. They will be different for each nation, and even when they overlap, they may be accorded different priorities. For example, in the UK terrorism stemming from the Northern Ireland problem remains a major national security concern. Spain has a terrorist problem as well, and all states can be at risk from both internal and external terrorist activity.<br>
			<br>
			The counter-terrorist requirements can absorb a considerable proportion of a nation's defence resources. In Northern Ireland, a fifth of the British Army are in place at any given time, and the need for roulement of troops involves all of the army. In this respect a national terrorism problem can have an indirect effect on a nation's ability to contribute to wider European security. For the future, there are concerns within the international community that extremist terrorist organisations may gain access to chemical, biological or nuclear weapons which would have profound implications on security.&nbsp;<br>
			<br>
			The world-wide drug trade is a security issue, which is not a directly military threat. It carries with both corruption and criminality cultures, which can be difficult to eradicate. They can lead to a breakdown in the rule of law, and put at risk democratic government. In all these policing fields there are significant long term national security problems for an increasing number of nations.&nbsp;<br>
			<br>
			Intelligence operations did not cease with the end of the Cold War. With the dependence on technological developments for economic success, some states and companies will use espionage techniques which have security implications. In particular, the massive increase in the use of networked computer systems for data storage has opened up new vulnerabilities. As economies become even more dependent on computer systems, states will need to pay attention to potential information system threats.<br>
			<br>
			Illegal immigration is an increasing problem, and the open internal borders of the European Union make it a shared problem to EU members.</p>
		<h4>What is NATO's Role?</h4>
		<p>Sometimes in Europe and the United States, the question is asked as to what relevance NATO has now, and what is its role with no Warsaw Pact as a threat. While Kosovo gave an example of how NATO can be used for modern world problems, it also showed the difficulties of working within the rules of the organisation. All the current member states, and certainly all the aspirant members continue to see the major benefit of membership as an insurance policy to provide defence of vital national interests at a lower cost through a collective security arrangement. In this sense, the lack of an obvious threat is unimportant.  The NATO members share the risks and benefits of committing themselves to the defence of each other. <br>
			<br>
			NATO also continues to act as a conflict prevention organisation within its membership. There is a transparency of information, and a will to settle potential causes of tension. It continues to keep the Greeks and Turks just about from each others throats. <br>
			On top of these direct security benefits, it is proving more and more valuable as a mechanism for the training, standardisation and development of procedures for armed forces who find themselves operating together under UN auspices, as ad-hoc coalitions or as a NATO intervention force. This very great benefit should not be underestimated. If NATO did not exist we would need to set up some sort of alternative mechanism for allowing multinational forces to operate together effectively.</p>
		<h4>Should NATO enlarge further?</h4>
		<p>Even if one accepts a continuing need for an alliance when the threat has disappeared, many experts are uncomfortable with the thought of it continuing to enlarge. They see this as having a number of problems. Decision making on a consensus basis had not always been easy between the 16 Cold War  members, even with a single view of the security threat. A larger membership, at a time of more diffuse purpose,  compounds this difficulty. The way operations were conducted in the Kosovo air campaign was constrained by the need for consensus among 19. In addition most European nations are in the process of significantly reducing the resources devoted to defence. Any new members of NATO would therefore be welcomed only if they could participate on an equal footing. There seemed little enthusiasm among the current NATO members for increasing their defence obligations in order to provide protection for new members. A diluted NATO, coupled with a lack of obvious threat, might lead to the demise of the organisation. For many however, the major problem is how to manage any expansion of NATO without risking a return to a confrontational and divided Europe. Expanding NATO would be a cause for concern to the nations which were not brought into the collective security arrangement. In particular Russia could feel threatened by its former adversary expanding and coming closer. <br>
			&nbsp;<br>
			The alternative is to leave NATO as it is at 19 nations with arrangements to cooperate with the Central and Eastern European states including Russia and the Ukraine. This co-operation through the PfP process has already advanced the moves to democracy greatly in a number of the countries. However, their enthusiastic involvement has been with the assurance that membership would ultimately be on offer. In any event, can it be a sensible policy for the newly free states of Europe to be denied membership of the co-operative security organisation which their western neighbours enjoy as a way of providing security at lower cost. Finally, membership of NATO prevents disputes between neighbouring members, and this is important as the newly free states develop.<br>
			&nbsp;<br>
			Handling Further NATO Enlargement<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
			The biggest problem of course is the question of how to handle the countries after the first three, and especially Russia. There is considerable concern that if this part of the process is mishandled, we could see Europe divided again. There does not seem to be a consistent view from those in Russia on what arrangement they might be satisfied with. Nor is the hope in some European capitals that, since NATO is self evidently not an aggressive organisation, the Russians will understand that an enlarged NATO is a good thing. The negotiation of a special relationship between Russia and NATO, with the Founding Act, was a triumph of diplomacy. In practice, the arrangement has been less successful than other aspects of the extended outreach by NATO. <br>
			&nbsp;<br>
			The Ukraine is in a different position, and seems to have difficulty in deciding where its best interests lie. Its special position has also been recognised in a separate NATO-Ukraine arrangement.  However, the current signs seem to be a rather backward move in democracy in the Ukraine.&nbsp; More problematic are the central European nations that were not included in the first invitation, the Baltic States, Romania and Bulgaria, Slovakia, Albania and the successor states in the former Yugoslavia. All these need to be brought closely into the European fold. It may be that the commitment for future enlargement coupled with a deepening of PfP to keep them interested will be enough. It will be a difficult diplomatic trick to turn. &nbsp; <br>
			&nbsp;<br>
			So the choice of approach, the achieving consensus of current states (and that becomes a greater problem in an enlarged NATO), and the handling of those left out, especially Russia and the Ukraine, are some of the problems. There are others: resources for the enlargement, resources to keep NATO as a real military force, the role of NATO, internal disputes between members (particularly Greece and Turkey and the question of Cyprus), the push by some for greater European command authority and the management of relations with the EU as the common foreign and security policy becomes more developed. <br>
			&nbsp;<br>
			How will EU develop to meet security needs?<br>
			&nbsp;<br>
			Let me turn then to the other side of the coin. As I said the European Union in its various stages of development has acted as a stabilising force. It has  enlarged over its history to move from the original six to 15 members now, and also to take in the 17 million people of East Germany with German Unification. The economic burden of this relatively small expansion has brought home, particularly to Germany, the costs of the process and the need for clear criteria for new members. To many it has looked as though the EU is moving deliberately slowly. The cynic might say that NATO enlargement can be made as a political decision and the problems solved afterwards, whereas EU enlargement is an economic decision which will have a direct effect on the wealth of the current members. The EU has moved with great care towards wider association agreements with prospective new members. Negotiations about the fine detail of each market sector have taken a long time both to hammer out. The first of the non-members to apply back in 1987, Turkey, still is without any date for prospective membership - hence its use of its NATO veto as a lever on the EU defence proposals from time to time. It took from 1990 to 1995 for the EU to move to a position where it has started to give a tentative timetable. The criteria for entry (the so-called Copenhagen criteria) require a functioning market economy which can cope with the competitive pressure inside the Union. <br>
			&nbsp;<br>
			In 1997, Jacques Santer presented Agenda 2000, which took this process forward significantly. It recommended that accession negotiations start with Hungary, Poland, Estonia, the Czech Republic and Slovenia. Negotiations opened at the same time as with Cyprus in 1998. Bulgaria, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia were invited into partnerships to speed up their preparations for membership. At Helsinki in December 1999, Malta, Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia and Turkey were added to the list of eligible applicants. There are suggestions that Georgia, Ukraine and even Kyrgystan have expressed a longer term interest. Timing remains uncertain but the first new members should be in within 5 years.<br>
			<br>
			&nbsp;<br>
			The interaction between EU and NATO enlargement <br>
			&nbsp;<br>
			What does all this mean for future European security. We had a headlong rush towards a limited but important expansion of NATO by 1999, and uncertainties how to handle the remainder of Europe in a NATO context beyond that. At the same time the EU is progressing more slowly, and in a more detailed negotiating fashion towards an orderly enlargement of its economic community. Membership of the EU may not overtly confer a security guarantee on member nations, but it certainly provides an implicit guarantee. It is inconceivable that EU nations would stand aside if one of their number came under external attack. Into this unclear future, we must also add the latest developments down the road to common foreign and security policy for Europe, and how it will relate to  NATO. . Behind both NATO and EU enlargement there is also the question of costs. As nations run down their national defence assets, they are showing little sign of being prepared to pay for the NATO or EU defence transition costs.  </p>
		<h4>The United States &amp; European Security</h4>
		<p>Finally what does this uncertain picture mean for the United States and its relations with Europe? There is no doubt that uppermost in the consideration of the current European members of NATO is the importance of keeping the organisation relevant to provide the key linkage with the US. This is not to suggest that there are not variations between States.  A mature European Union expanded to 25 or more countries perhaps towards the end of the decade, would have twice the population of the United States. On current figures its combined GDP would already be a fifth greater than that of the US, and of course for many of the states they would expect to have a rapid growth ahead until they caught up with their western European neighbours. This would make Europe relatively even richer. It seems unlikely that under such circumstances, a stable and secure Europe, rich and populous, that US would wish to keep its 100,000 troops based in Europe. However a draw down of these could lead to a weakening of the NATO transatlantic bond, particularly if NATO felt it had no real role. From a European perspective therefore the long term security of the continent must centre on the development of a European foreign and security policy with an ability to carry it out on a European basis. We are a long way from that as yet. &nbsp;</p>
		<h4>Conclusion</h4>
		<p>Europe faces uncertainties, but no clear major risks to its security in the next decade, provided that it can manage the transition of the former Soviet Union into a collection of partner states. This it can best do through the evolution of the European Union and NATO. Both will need to help Central and Eastern European nations including Russia with both economic and security improvements. At the same time, it will remain important to keep the United States closely involved. There is an unusual opportunity for enhancing European security at the same time as enhancing economic prospects. It does however require the Western European nations to be generous in their help to the rest of Europe.</p>
