<P>The use of organisms in warfare has a long,  if inglorious,
history. In 1346 the Mongols used plague corpses to infect the
defenders in the siege of Caffa. The disease spread rapidly in the
confined town, and the inhabitants were overcome. The British used
smallpox patients' blankets as a gift to American Indians in 1763,
and produced the desired effect of the spread of the disease among
the tribes. The use of the anthrax organism was considered by the
Allies in World War 2. Tests were carried out in 1941 and 1942 on
Gruinard Island off Scotland. The organism was so potent and hardy
that it was only in 1988 that the Island was declared safe for
unprotected humans.(1) </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Biological warfare (BW) has been waged with limited success on a
few isolated occasions. While it potentially offers great killing
power for small investment,  the results have been unpredictable and
unreliable.  We are now moving into an age where developments in
biotechnology offer the prospect of designing organisms for specific
tasks,  and this has significant military implications. An organism
feeds on specific substances as nutrients, converts them to other
substances, and multiplies under the right conditions. For thousands
of years the ability of the yeast organism to feed on fruit sugar and
convert it to ethanol has been used to the benefit of the winemaker -
and wine drinker. Alcohol can also be used as a fuel, and yeast
offers the prospect of strategic independence from oil suppliers. In
the First World War starch was fermented with a bacterium to produce
acetone and butanol which were needed for the munitions industry.
Organisms can help nations at war both as offensive weapons and also
as new sources of supply of strategic materials.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>To see why biological warfare is becoming a more threatening
possibility, it is first necessary to look at the current state of
biotechnology, and then the future possibilities. Mankind had used
genetic engineering of a sort for thousands of years in producing
crops of a singular strain, and selectively breeding animals for
particular qualities. It was not until 1953 that the method by which
such genetic qualities are passed on to successive generations was
discovered. Francis Crick and James Watson explained how genetic
information was stored and replicated through the double helix
structure  of  the  DNA molecule.  Nucleic acids, of which DNA
(Deoxyribonucleic Acid) is one,are found in all living organisms, and
play the key role  in the  transmission  of  hereditary
characteristics. It took another two decades for this research to
develop into successful genetic engineering:  manipulating genetic
codes to provide specialised organisms. The process involves the
insertion of genetic information into an organism, which is usually a
bacterium, to give it new capabilities. Subsequent research has
developed methods for designing and arranging the building blocks of
DNA into a required structure. Whereas the early synthesis of human
insulin required genetic material from human cells,  it can now be
entirely artificially constructed.(2) The mapping of the human genome
is a project which is absorbing worldwide research effort, and will
have many consequences for preventative medicine.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P> Biotechnology is a young science,  but already the potential is
vast. On first consideration it might appear that, for the military,
the biological warfare possibilities are the most serious aspects to
examine. If the scientist can design the organism to have specified
characteristics, surely this offers an efficient method of killing
the enemy? Before accepting this hypothesis,  it is worthwhile
considering why biological warfare has been so limited in the past,
and what new qualities agents would need to make it more successful
in the future. An unclassified US military manual (3),although 40
years old, gives an excellent insight into the requirements of BW
agents. BW differs from other combat methods by being entirely
anti-personnel. Indeed it sets out to achieve what the popular press
claimed for the Neutron Bomb:  killing people not property. That
killing can be achieved by disease, either through micro-organisms
directly or indirectly from vectors such as insects;  by toxins
produced by organisms; or by yet more indirect method of killing
livestock or crops. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The essential requirements of BW agents are: consistency in
effect, ease of production, stability in store, ease of dissemination
and stability after dissemination. Depending on its particular role
it will need a number of other qualities: short incubation period,
appropriate persistence, difficult to detect, difficult to take
counter-measures, yet easy to take self protection measures. Anthrax
as we have seen has long persistence and stability, but this becomes
a disadvantage to friendly troops if the area remains dangerously
contaminated for forty years. It has a relatively short incubation
period (between 1 and 7 days), but this is a long time in any modern
war. It would be unfortunate if a ceasefire were agreed after 3 days'
fighting, and the next day one side began to have 25% deaths from
anthrax. Indeed the question of time from delivery to causing
incapacity is crucial. It is possible to imagine a BW agent which is
slow to act, but is also rapidly spread by cross-infection, being
used in an undeclared war. The problem would be that the forces
delivering the weapon would in due course be at risk from it.  The
annual spread of influenza around the world is an example of how all
mankind is vulnerable to highly infectious diseases. The state
wishing to use such a weapon could take protective measures for its
own population, but these would difficult to hide, and could be taken
as evidence of hostile action. Such a weapon is more likely to appeal
to terrorist organisations. Looking to the future it is possible that
viruses could be tailored to attack particular ethnic groups by using
the differences in gene frequencies among the target population.(4).
Also possible would be the weapons which would attack the genetic
material of the target, rather than producing disease or poisoning by
producing toxins. These genetic weapons would again have only long
term effects, and have no place on the tactical battlefield. Indeed
given total freedom to design a battlefield bacteriological weapon,
it is difficult to see what tactical advantages it offers over
chemical weapons. Incubation and incapacitating periods would be
reduced to a minimum,  but are unlikely to come down to the few
seconds for CW agents,  or  the near instantaneous effect of
conventional weaponry. The Ebola virus is an example of a rapidly
acting killer, which as a result can be isloated and then burns
itself out.  Even so the timescale remains measured in days. The
spreading of disease can become a problem to friendly forces, and the
long term effects may be unpredictable. The protective measures taken
against chemical weapons will also be effective against BW agents.
The only significant advantage would be in the psychological effects.
It might be that soldiers and civil populations under attack from
disease would suffer greater stress than those vulnerable to more
traditional killing systems. The international horror of biological
warfare can also reduce the incentive to develop capabilities in this
field.  As there are few gains to be made from the use of such
weapons in combat, military leaders should endorse moves towards arms
control in this area.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>If BW is of limited use, even with genetically engineered agents,
can it be discounted? Unfortunately the strategic, covert, long-term
use of micro-organisms is a real threat. If an agent can be tailored
to kill a particular population group, undeclared war could be waged
most effectively. The spread of the HTLV-III AIDS virus gives an
example of how a long term agent can spread exponentially. In the
case of AIDS the discrimination is caused by methods of infection.
The ethnic weapons suggest that targeting might be much more
selective. Alternatively, economic war might be waged by targeting
the main food crop of a particular nation with a particular virus.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>These  possibilities  offer a possible form of warfare  for
terrorist groups as well as unethical states. The use of the nerve
agent Sarin, by a Japanese cult movement as a weapon of terror in
1995, serves as a reminder of the potential dangers from irrational
terrorist action.  There is also an increasing concern that new
resistant strains of viruses will spread even without intervention
from malevolent agents. The combination of rapid world-wide travel
and misuse of anti-biotics has left countries more vulnerable to
epidemics, which may be widespread and fatal. This is a security
problem which may require military measures to control.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The prospects are not entirely negative however. As the technology
to design destructive agents increases, so also does the ability to
manufacture vaccines and other protective measures. The difficulty
should not be under-rated, and the case of AIDS again illustrates the
time it takes. Nevertheless,  genetic engineering will provide
protective vaccines and toxoids. It will provide protection in other
ways as well. The characteristic of an organism to feed on a given
nutrient, and convert it to another substance, can be used to make
very senstive and selective sensors.  These biosensors will be
engineered to act as rapid and cheap chemical agent detectors.  The
protective measures against chemical and biological agents are of no
use unless they are deployed in time. The biosensors will be able to
detect such small concentrations in such rapid time that effective
protective measures can be taken. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>It is conceivable that these micro-organism sensors could be
developed to detect other militarily significant emissions. If we
think of the biosensor as feeding on a few specified molecules, and
amplifying its output through a cascade of suitable organisms then it
becomes an extremely sensitive "nose". Could this sniffer detect
gases from a submerged submarine, or smell out hidden troops, or tell
a missile whether it was about to strike a friendly or enemy</P>

<P>aircraft? None of this is any more unlikely than the ability of a
dog to find drugs or explosives on the basis of a few molecules of
escaping vapour. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The developments in biotechnology will for the most part be driven
by the needs of the civilian sector. In the medical sphere this will
be in the prevention and cure of disease, and hence have a direct
benefit to the military requirement both for protection, and also for
rapid healing of casualties. In the industrial field, the early work
on production of fuel from sugar by fermentation points to the
prospect of new fuel sources. Genetic engineering offers the prospect
of designing a yeast that feeds on cellulose to produce alcohol.  It
would then be able to make fuel directly from all plant material.
This would make a nation independent of oil supplies.  When the
military first started worrying about the finite nature of oil
following the 1973 crisis, schemes for using hydrogen instead of oil
abounded. The difficulty was the high energy requirements to extract
hydrogen by electrolysis from water. It may prove to be possible to
extract hydrogen molecules from water by growing a genetically
engineered algae or bacteria.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Microbes are already being used in industrial processes to
concentrate minerals, clean up pollutants and to synthesise plastics.
The techniques for extraction of metals from low grade ores using
microbes may offer cheap methods for obtaining weapon grade uranium.
The Stanrock Uranium Mine in Canada use bacteria to leach uranium
oxide from rock without mining the ore.  The required mineral
accumulates in pools where it can be readily collected.(5). It is
possible to conceive of the military use of a microbe which would be
designed to eat strategic material. If a rapidly breeding bacteria
which decomposed stainless steel, or plastic, or protective clothing
were used on an enemy and its equipment, the results could be
catastrophic. However,  if the organism were long lived and rapid
breeding, it would soon become a threat to both sides in a conflict.
If it were not,  then it is likely that conventional forms of attack
would be more effective. It seems that whenever biological offensive
methods are considered, the same problems in usage arise. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Biotechnology is also moving towards electronics and photonics in
</P>

<P>the realm of computing.  The  limit  on component density in
conventional silicon chip type technology is within sight as we
explore in the next chapter. Photonics offer one method of increasing
chip density and computing speeds and power. The brain shows that
organisms can achieve very much higher packing densities. While the
possibility of producing artificial brains is beyond the timescale
considered here, biochips are possible in the relatively near term. 
</P>

<P>The ability to design protein molecules which are organised in
predetermined three dimensional structures gives the prospect of
growing circuits.  Semiconductor molecules would be included in the
protein framework.  The biochip could then be self reproducing,
regenerative, and of high capacity. Militarily the added advantage
could be resistance to electromagnetic pulse effects, as well as very
compact size for given capacity.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P> It is clear from the wide range of possible developments in
biotechnology that it is an area  of  research  which merits
considerable effort. Many of the developments will be achieved by
commercial pressures. However, while civil techniques will be usable
by the military,  there will be a need for considerable defence
investment. In particular the use of biosensors is likely to be of
greatly increased importance. In the longer term the biochip may be
an important advance in computer technology.  As to biological
offensive warfare there is little to suggest that genetic engineering
offers a war-winning weapon. The threat of covert use of biological
agents must be countered.  This will be partly a question 
verification of treaty obligations, partly of intelligence, and
partly defensive measure research:  a field for civil and military
co-operation.</P>
