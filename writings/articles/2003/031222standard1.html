			<h3>Libya's Gift </h3>

			<p>Colonel Gadaffy has made the key move which could see the end of US sanctions against Libya. For over a quarter of a century, he has been a difficult, unpredictable and occasionally dangerous head of state. Seeing himself as the natural leader of the both the Arab and African world, he has sought the weaponry to go with such status.  He tried unsuccessfully to gain a nuclear capability through deals with China, Pakistan and the Soviet Union. He has continued research, and is said to have made progress with uranium enrichment.<br>
				<br>
				Libya has been more successful in producing chemical weapons. By 1990, it was believed to have stocks of up to 100 tons of blister and nerve agent at its Rabta facility. On biological weapons, all the intelligence seems to suggest that Gadaffy retained a research and development capability, but that there was no production of weapons. For delivery systems, Libya had a mixture of aging Soviet bombers and surface to surface missiles of limited range. It had been trying, apparently unsuccessfully, to improve its delivery systems for many years.<br>
				<br>
				If the Libyan nuclear, biological and chemical programmes have been seen by the West as less threatening than some, the support of Colonel Gadaffy for various terrorist groups has been a much greater concern. He provided help to groups ranging from the IRA  to Arab terror organisations. The Libyan link with the Pan Am Flight 103, which exploded over Lockerbie in 1988, put them firmly in the rogue state category. UN sanctions led to a hand over of  the Lockerbie suspects in 1998 with the trial following 3 years later. <br>
				<br>
				In the USA, the Iran Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA) was not lifted at the same time as the UN sanctions. This was a great disappointment to the Libyans who expected to be rewarded for their co-operation, and for the offer of  large payouts to relatives of the Lockerbie victims. It appears that they have also been helpful in intelligence co-operation after the 9/11 attacks. But the US Congress was in no mood to remove sanctions from a state which had supported terrorism, was an enemy of Israel, and seemed still to be trying to go down the WMD route. <br>
				<br>
				Gadaffy has managed to time his offer to give up all WMD for maximum political leverage. Both Bush and Blair will be very relieved to have had two lots of good news before Christmas. The capture of Saddam and the finding of WMD (even in Libya rather than Iraq) will quell some of the criticism for now. Libya may now have done enough to get off the sanctions hook, and can look forward to a much more prosperous new year.<br>
