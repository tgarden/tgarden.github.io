<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The latest headlines about poor RAF bombing
accuracy during the Kosovo campaign have resulted in great
opportunities for the cartoonists. A desk bound pilot is shown
tossing the crumpled report towards his waste paper basket - and
missing. What are the real issues?  The RAF released some 1011
weapons during the air campaign. Over half of these were cluster
bombs which cover an area target and so are not assessed  for
pinpoint accuracy. Only a quarter were laser guided smart bombs and
the remaining 230 were freefall 1000lb bombs of World War 2 design.
These bombs are targeted by identifying ground features using radar,
and computing a release point based on information about aircraft
speed, altitude and position modified for the wind they are expected
to experienceduring the descent. Since there is no form of terminal
guidance, the accuracy of the bomb decreases as its flight time
increases. In other words the higher the release point, the more
effect inaccuracies in the release parameters will have on the
eventual impact point. Unexpected changes in wind speed and direction
alone will cause dispersion around the aiming point. All this is well
understood by pilots, who can refer to tables to calculate the
probability of particular impact distances from desired aiming point.
Some targets, such as fuel storage sites, cover a wide area and a
relatively wide dispersion may be acceptable. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The widely quoted 2% accuracy figure for
these 1000lb bombs is spurious. The figure reflects the number of
dumb bombs that were observed to strike their targets. Since
virtually all this type of bombing was done through cloud, nothing
can be deduced from the low number of positive observations. Indeed,
the wide media misquoting of this figure lends support to the MOD
view that such data should not have been released.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">For the future what lessons should be
learned from this little episode? From the military side, there is
nothing new. Some will remember the bombing of Stanley airfield by
Vulcans in the Falklands Conflict. Again the media leapt on the fact
that only 2 out 21 bombs (the same 1000lb dumb bombs) had hit the
runway. Yet the target planners, in allowing for the dispersion
effect, had optimised their chance of cutting the runway by attacking
at an angle off rather than along the line of the runway. The RAF
will use the political embarrassment to push for more and better
smart weapons. Even so, there will be times when dumb bombs are
useful. The current enthusiasm for the US JDAMS (a bomb guided by
satellite navigation) will accelerate work by potential enemies on
spoofing or jamming the satellite signals. There is no single answer
in warfare; and it is always dangerous to think that there is.</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">It might also be a salutary reminder not to
carried away with rhetoric. The RAF contribution to the Kosovo crisis
was politically significant but modest in military effect. A little
humility never goes amiss.</FONT></P>
