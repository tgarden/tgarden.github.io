<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The number of high profile stories about
Ministry of Defence incompetence, poor management and future
prospective cuts has continued unabated by the Summer Recess. The
latest "exclusive", shared between the BBC and Jane's, was a leaked
internal paper looking at the future aircraft equipment programme. In
essence, the paper highlighted a budgetary shortfall of some
&#163;1.5bn in the air systems programme over the 10 year planning
period, and offered some ways to subsidise the future equipment
programme by reducing the day to day running costs of currently
deployed air systems. Although the recently restructured financial
management system in the MOD was supposed to reduce the amount of
interchange between current operating costs and the capital equipment
programme, nobody really believed that the two would remain separated
for long. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The options offered were hardly novel. There
was the possibility of salami slicing across a number of
capabilities. Reduce the number of aircraft on every front line
squadron, and make the ones that remain work a bit harder. This is
always a politically attractive option. It is less obvious to the
public, and the senior military can claim to have preserved the
historic squadrons of the past. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The other option was to remove one aircraft
type from the frontline. This is a much more difficult approach to
sell. Squadrons disappear and retired air marshals, celebrating the
60th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, make apocalyptic
pronouncements on the media. Yet to make real running cost savings,
the reduction of aircraft types will always be a more cost effective
approach. Since the end of the Second World War, the number of
different types of combat aircraft being operated by all major air
forces has been decreasing. The RAF seems set on a path where it will
ultimately operate two main types: an air defence fighter and a
precision bomber. It may be that advances in stand-off weaponry will
allow Eurofighter to fit the bill for both roles, but for now it
looks as though the Tornado and its successor will be needed for the
bomber task. The UK currently operates the Harrier, the Jaguar and
the Tornado in the offensive roles, and a quite different type of
Harrier and Tornado for its air defence needs. Operating 5 aircraft
types when the aim is to reduce to two suggests an obvious place for
economy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">There are arguments to be made for and
against selecting any of these for the chop. The Jaguar is arguably
the least capable of the three bombers. However, the single pilot
operators will need to be kept ready for the Eurofighter as it comes
into service. On the air defence side, the Tornado F3 is a relic of
the Cold War needs for long range interception of Soviet bombers, and
is unsuited to many of the air defence requirements of today. The Sea
Harrier is very limited in its operating range, but is all the Royal
Navy has to keep a foot in the door for its future carriers. These,
and many other, fierce arguments within Services and between Services
have been the normal course of putting together the Defence
programme. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The tiny uplift in the July Comprehensive
Spending Review will have left many such resource problems. The
lessons of Kosovo have added new unplanned costs to the future
equipment programme. Smart Procurement and the Defence Logistics
Organisation will find it difficult to deliver the savings assumed.
Whitehall warriors will explore the previously unthinkable in order
to deliver advice on the best balance of capability, commitment and
resources to Ministers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The big change now is that the process of
exploring options is no longer an internal activity. Whitehall is
having to come to terms with the fact that its musings are the common
currency of the specialist internet forums. In the past, staff
officers from MOD or Command HQ might let slip some unguarded remark
in the bar at a flying station they were visiting. Rumours circulated
slowly and without focus among the operators. Today, those rumours
are posted on the Web, and read avidly by people whose futures depend
on policy decisions in Whitehall. In a matter of hours, the overall
picture is built up, and the journalists who take an interest will
have a story. This makes it very difficult for policy planners in
Whitehall. They would prefer to work through their ideas before
presenting them to Ministers. However, once the story is leading the
morning news, it is Ministers who have to stand in the firing line. 
Insiders will have been amused to hear Dr Moonie, the junior Defence
Minister, describe a paper that had gone to the Air Force Board as "a
speculative think piece". Nevertheless, he was right. Ministers would
have needed to look at any proposal for high profile squadron cuts,
and, even without the media roasting, would probably have gone for a
less efficient, more politically acceptable, savings measure such as
salami slicing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The wider availability of policy development
information on the Web means that Whitehall will have to change its
methods. Ministers will want to be involved much earlier in the
process. This may mean worse rather than better decisions.</FONT>
