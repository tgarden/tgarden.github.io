<H2><CENTER>Israeli Nuclear Strategy</CENTER></H2>

<P><CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER></P>

<P>The six countries examined previously have all demonstrated by the
means of a test explosion their capability to produce atomic weapons.
Israel has neither openly tested a nuclear device, nor claims to have
a nuclear arsenal. Nevertheless, there is sufficient belief in the
existence of an Israeli nuclear stockpile for it to have a credible
nuclear deterrent strategy.</P>

<P>It has been said that Israel has always been a nuclear country.l
Within a year of the establishment of the state in 1948, the first
plans for the nuclear research programme had been made. The Israel
Atomic Energy Commission was established in 1952 and was,
significantly, placed within the Defence Ministry. No written terms
of reference were produced for the Commission. Israeli scientists
were sent abroad for training, an agreement was signed with France in
1953 for atomic cooperation, and another with the United States in
1954. A research reactor was purchased from the United States and
became critical in 1960 at Nahal Soreq. This reactor was not a
plutonium producer, and was unlikely to be used for weapon production
purposes.</P>

<P><CENTER>WEAPON PRODUCTION CAPABILITY</CENTER></P>

<P>In 1957, Israel and France concluded a secret agreement which was
to result in a large research reactor being built for the Defence
Ministry at Dimona in the northern Negev. All the members of the
Atomic Energy Commission resigned in 1957 and it has been suggested 2
that this was to indicate their opposition to the military uses of
the proposed reactor. In late 1964, the Dimona reactor became
critical, and started producing about 8 kg of plutonium per year:
enough for between one and two fission weapons after reprocessing.3
It was suggested that the French-Israeli cooperation extended to the
testing of a jointly designed atomic bomb at France's Sahara testing
ground.4 There have also been improbable reports of a secret
underground test in the Negev in 1963.5 Whether either of these
reports is true does not effect the capability of Israel to produce
nuclear weapons. Professor Van Cleave, looking at the need for tests,
concluded:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>For 'first generation' fssion bombs,
testing by the Nth country would not be required for development ...
By now, certainly, it can be confidently assumed that the basic
design will work without testing, and work within a reasonable degree
of predictability ... a test of a first-generation nuclear weapon by
an Nth country has more political than technical significance.~.6
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Having established a steady production system for plutonium
fissile material, a reprocessing plant was necessary for rapid
conversion to weapons' grade ore. The design of such a plant is
distinctive, and there is thus agreement that Israel did not build
one. The reason for this omission appears to be that Israel was
successful in illegally acquiring a significant stock of enriched
uranium. CIA reports have revealed that Israel obtained 'large
quantities of enriched uranium by clandestine means'.7 The New York
Times report of this reminded readers of the loss of highly enriched
uranium from the Nuclear Materials and Equipment Corporation in
Apollo, Pennsylvania in 1965.</P>

<P>Keeping track of nuclear fuel is always difficult; however, of the
382 pounds missing, the investigating commission decided that at
least 206 pounds could not be accounted for as 'lost in the pipes'.
This is sufficient for about 14 bombs.8</P>

<P>If Israel did manage to obtain nuclear weapon material in 1965, it
would explain why no plutonium reprocessing plant was built. With an
assured uranium capability, it could use the slower, but politically
uncontroversial, method of 'hot laboratory' plutonium separation
gradually to increase its stockpile.9</P>

<P><CENTER>NUCLEAR POSTURE</CENTER></P>

<P>Premier Eshkol in 1966, President Katzir in 1974 and Premier Rabin
in 1975 have all stated that Israel will not be the first to
introduce nuclear weapons into the Middle East.l&#176; This somewhat
cryptic posture is useful in increasing the uncertainty of Israel's
potential enemies. A report 11 in 1976 of a CIA briefing claimed that
the Israeli arsenal of 13 weapons was prepared for possible use at
the start of the 1973 war. Defence Minister Moshe Dyan was quoted in
the report as justifying the Israeli nuclear option as, 'Israel has
no choice, with our manpower we cannot physically go on acquiring
more and more tanks and more and more planes'. The readiness to use
their nuclear weapons to fight, if they are in danger of being
defeated, indicates that the 'no first use' policy is rhetoric.</P>

<P>Israel's seriousness in obtaining a credible nuclear capability
can also be seen in the procurement of suitable delivery systems.
Nuclear warheads could be fitted to Jericho, Lance and Harpoon
missiles; nuclear bombs could be dropped by F-4E Phantoms, Kfir-C2s,
F-lSs or even A-4 Skyhawks. Israel tried to purchase Pershing
missiles from the United States in 1975, but withdrew the request
when it provoked considerable controversy in Washington.12 Certainly
Jericho, Lance and, had it been procured, Pershing, make more
military sense in a nuclear role than in a conventional one.</P>

<P>There is little doubt that Israel is a nuclear weapon state.
Initially it raced, by all possible methods, to provide itself with a
last resort capability. This could be used if there was an imminent
danger of being 'pushed into the sea' by its Arab enemies. It may now
be developing a nuclear war-fighting capability~ to compensate for
its numerical inferiority. Its ambiguous position does not appear to
have deterred its &#176;opponents from aggression. One Israeli
strategist has suggested, 'To maximise the odds of security and
peace, Israel must adopt a doctrine of explicit strategic nuclear
deterrence'.13 An open declaration of nuclear capability might result
in Soviet nuclear guarantees to the Arabs, or a reduction in support
from the United States. Its strategy is therefore unlikely to change,
and it will remain prepared to use nuclear weapons if the need</P>
