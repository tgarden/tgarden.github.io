<H3><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Introduction</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Any comparative study of security
needs and provision will start from an analysis of the risks that a
nation faces. For some States risks may be from internal disorder,
for others there may be real or potential external threats. The first
priority of any government must be to ensure the safety and security
of the nation, and in particular the preservation of the democratic
institutions. Security is increasingly seen as a much more complex
issue than can be addressed merely through the provision of armed
forces. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Military capability is certainly
an important aspect of defence of a state from external threat, and,
with the police, can have a key role in internal stability
operations. Nevertheless, international crime is becoming a more
dangerous threat to the survival of some states in various parts of
the world. There are other security issues which are of a quite
different nature: environmental degradation, migration, disease,
famine, pollution, water availability, economic instability and
globalisation of markets can all have profound effects on the
viability of nation states.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">In this paper, the way in which
the United Kingdom addresses its security needs is considered and
compared with the parallel concerns of Brazil. The paper will
identify where there may be common interests, either geostrategic, as
in the case of the South Atlantic, or similar requirements where
industrial, political or doctrinal activities offer opportunities for
co-operation. The paper will focus on the military aspects of
security, but will highlight the wider security aspects where
appropriate.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">The Comparative Statistics
</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Brazil and the United Kingdom are
geographically very different countries, and this means that they
have had a very different set of security concerns over the years.
The United Kingdom is a relatively small (245,000 sq km), densely
populated (58 million people) temperate island separated from an
equally populous western Europe by only a few km of sea. It has
adequate water resources; its own oil and gas reserves; nuclear,
coal, oil, gas and hydro-electric power; a stable, mature, low
inflation, steady growth economy (GDP/capita of US$ 18,000). Brazil,
a continental state is vastly greater in land area at some 35 times
the land area. It has a significant coastline about half the length
of that of the UK. The Brazilian population has grown from being much
the same as that of the United Kingdom half a century ago, until is
now almost 3 times as large. Brazil is also rich in energy resources,
and water. Its economy is in steady growth (4.2% in 1995) and a
GDP/capita of US$ 4,345. Very high inflation rates have been a
difficult problem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">We have therefore two very
different nations. Brazil a vast fast growing continental nation, and
the United Kingdom a small European island nation with a mature
economy. Yet a comparison of the statistics on the armed forces shows
a number of interesting similarities. Brazil fields 295,000 military
personnel compared with 236,900 for the United Kingdom. Brazil
divides these so that half are in the army and the other half are
equally divided between the navy and the air force. The proportions
for the United Kingdom forces are broadly similar. The UK spends some
US$ 35 billion per year on defence, and expenditure has declined from
5% of GDP to 3% of GDP since 1985. Brazil's defence expenditure has
doubled in real terms over the same period, but at US$ 6.5 billion in
1995 is only 1.6% of GDP. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">The next part of the analysis in
this paper will look at the defence requirements for the two nations.
It will seek to show whether there is a common basis for the
derivation of force requirements.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">The Defence Requirement for the
United Kingdom</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">The process by which the United
Kingdom derives its defence policy is very transparent. In broad
terms an annual analysis is carried out of the security and foreign
policy requirements. The forces in being are allocated to the tasks
(both potential and real), and areas of duplication or lack of
resource are identified. All this analysis is constrained by the
available resources from government for defence, and the government
in the end has to make choices about priorities. This process of
development of defence policy is from time disrupted either by major
change to the international scene (such as the end of the Cold War),
or by a major change in resources available for defence. When this
happens a more fundamental review takes place. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Following the end of the Cold War,
the British Government put in hand a complete review of the type and
scale of forces that it would need for the new security order. The
assumptions that were made in that review have been modified slightly
in subsequent years, but have remained broadly the same since. The
philosophy behind the structure and resourcing of the defence forces
is published each year in an official government paper, called The
Statement on the Defence Estimates, but more widely known as the
Defence White Paper. The description that follows is taken from the
most recent of these papers. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">British Defence policy identifies
as its aim:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><ADDRESS><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">The goal of our
security policy is to maintain the freedom and territorial integrity
of the United Kingdom and its Dependent Territories, and the ability
to pursue its legitimate interests at home and abroad. </FONT>
</ADDRESS></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">This goal is addressed through
three different requirements:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">a. Helping where
necessary to sustain the rule of law within the United Kingdom and
its Dependent Territories.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">b. Working to reduce the risk of,
or if necessary deterring and defending against, external aggression
against the United Kingdom, its Dependent Territories or its vital
national interests.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">c. More broadly, promoting an
international framework that favours freedom and democratic
institutions and open trading relationships, and that allows people
everywhere to pursue and enhance their well-being, in the belief that
this will not only be to the national benefit, including greater
security, but also to the benefit of the international community as a
whole.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">The United Kingdom's interests are
derived from a number of historical as well as geostrategic factors.
Although the legacy of the British Empire has reduced substantially
over the years, there still remain 13 Dependent Territories after
Hong Kong has been returned to China. In addition the world-wide
trading tradition has led to large numbers of British citizens living
and working in areas of potential instability around the world. The
United Kingdom has therefore a number of distant national
obligations, which remain regardless of its obligations under
treaties. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">In the post World War 2 world, the
United Kingdom saw its own security from external aggression as being
based on its membership of NATO. It has been a leading contributor to
NATO, and has taken it membership obligations very seriously. It is
also a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, and
this has had implications for the international military
contributions that it has felt necessary to provide.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">The defence planning process takes
the goals of British foreign and security policy and translates them
into a number of possible military mission types. Currently the
government identifies seven mission types: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">a. Military Aid to the
Civil Authorities in the United Kingdom, including Military Aid to
the Civil Power, Military Assistance to Civil Ministries and Military
Aid to the Civil Community.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">b. A challenge to the internal and
external security of a Dependent Territory or overseas
possession.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">c. A British contribution to
NATO's and the Western European Union's (WEU) new missions.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">d. Other military assistance and
limited operations, characteristically of lower intensity and longer
duration, to support both British interests and international order
and humanitarian principles, the latter most likely under United
Nations auspices.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">e. A serious conflict (but not an
attack on NATO or one of its members) which, if unchecked, could
adversely affect European security, or could pose a serious threat to
British interests elsewhere, or to international security.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">f. A limited regional conflict
involving a NATO ally who calls for assistance under Article 5 of the
Washington Treaty.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">g. General War - a large scale
attack against NATO.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">These seven possible mission types
in turn generate a range of military tasks, which are identified,
published, and the necessary forces can be allocated. It is not
necessary to provide separate forces for each task, as judgements are
made over the likelihood of concurrent operations being necessary.
Some fifty different tasks are quantified and the number of combat
units necessary for each is assessed. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">In looking at the size, type and
equipment for the military, assumptions must be made about whether
particular tasks will be carried out in concert with allies, or
whether the capability must be truly national and independent.
Successive governments have sought to provide forces for national
protection and security, and for the security of Dependent
Territories, which are independent of support from allies. These
capabilities are required even when there is no perceived threat, and
therefore must be considered first to ensure that adequate provision
is made.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">A major element of this national
capability is the provision of an independent nuclear capability.
This is provided by four ballistic missile submarines, which ensure
that there is a continuous deterrent patrol. National airspace and
territorial waters protection and defence are other key tasks in this
respect. A demanding part of the national task is that of military
aid to the civil power in Northern Ireland. The continuing terrorist
activity in the province means that British armed forces are used in
significant numbers in a support role to the police. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">The requirements stemming from the
task of protecting Dependent Territories is carried out in a number
of different ways. Forces are stationed on some of the territories
and their numbers can be substantial. The most demanding of these is
the security of the Falklands and South Georgia.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<ADDRESS><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Military Task 1.18: The
United Kingdom continues to maintain a defensive capability in the
South Atlantic. The garrison is tasked with maintaining the integrity
of Mount Pleasant airfield as an airhead for reinforcement; defending
other military installations in the Falkland Islands; providing for
the safety of shipping and aircraft within the area; countering
military action against South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands;
and providing 24-hour military Search and Rescue (SAR) cover and,
when military cover is not affected, SAR for the civil community.
</FONT></ADDRESS>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">If the national requirements must
be provided so that the United Kingdom can carry them out unaided,
the insurance against the emergence of some major external threat is
provided by membership of NATO. This carries with it obligations to
the defence of all other NATO members. Some of the forces required
for national purposes are also available to contribute to the tasks
in support of NATO. While in theory it might be possible for the
United Kingdom to specialise in some military capabilities, while
other Allies take on different roles, it has decided that it should
field a broad spread of high intensity conflict combat systems.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Land, sea and air forces are
allocated to NATO's forces. Some are held for the immediate reaction
element, some for main defence forces (at lower states of readiness),
and at the lowest readiness are a number of augmentation forces. A
large component of these forces are based in Germany, although the
numbers have declined in recent years. A particular responsibility
stems from the fact that the United Kingdom takes the lead in the
multinational Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC). The
ARRC brings together the forces of 12 nations, and some 55,000
British Army troops are assigned to the formation. It represents high
readiness forces available to NATO, and can deploy quickly up to 4
divisions from the 10 divisions that are allocated to it. This
combination of availability, capability and multinationality has
meant that it is seen as the natural military arm of NATO for peace
support operations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">After national and alliance tasks,
the third group of military tasks are those that contribute to
promoting the United Kingdom's wider security interests throughout
the world. These tasks will include humanitarian and disaster relief,
UN sponsored operations, and operations under bilateral arrangements
with other states. British forces also provide significant military
assistance and training around the world.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Future Developments in British
Security Policy</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">This paper is written at a time
when a number of factors have come together which may cause
significant change in British Defence policy. The most significant
internal factor is the change of government which has followed the
election of 1 May 1997. The Labour Party was elected with a large
absolute majority, replacing the Conservative Party which had been in
power for some 18 years. The Labour Party manifesto had promised that
a full scale review of defence would be undertaken and completed
within 6 months of assuming power. In the first weeks of the new
government, this defence review was confirmed by the Defence
Secretary George Robertson. At the same the new Foreign Secretary,
Robin Cook, launched his approach to a new ethical foreign policy.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">It is not yet possible to say what
difference this will make to the military capability that the United
Kingdom fields. Externally there are also a number of events which
will affect security thinking. The enlargement of NATO is unlikely to
have an immediate effect on the way the United Kingdom approaches its
contribution to the Alliance. The United Kingdom supported the three
prospective new members (Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic) for
accession in 1999. At the same time the European Union is pressing
for a greater commitment to a common security and defence identity
for Europe. While some nations see this as possible through a direct
relationship between the European Union and the Western European
Union, the United Kingdom government is pressing for European
security to continue to be based on NATO.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">The parameters of the defence
review are becoming clear. There is (as is usually the case) a
statement that it is not a cost saving exercise. It is seen rather as
a balancing exercise to ensure that commitments and resources are
matched. Nevertheless, a number of features of the defence programme
appear to have been excluded from the review process. Perhaps most
surprisingly has been the exclusion of the nuclear capability from
consideration. It may be that an examination of readiness
requirements will make some changes at the margins, but the new
Labour government is committed to continuing the four Trident
submarine nuclear deterrent force. The large project for a new air
defence fighter (the Eurofighter 2000) has also been excluded from
the Review process. This four nation project (UK, Germany, Italy and
Spain) is designed to deliver an agile multi-role fighter early in
the next century. The new government has made it clear in
negotiations with Germany that it is as committed to the purchase as
was the last government. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Some had thought the breadth of
British capability might be under question. The forces are
increasingly being used in police type operations, whether in
Northern Ireland or overseas on UN adventures. There are those who
argue that the maintenance of the full range of high intensity
warfighting capabilities is no longer necessary, and that a
rebalancing towards low intensity operations is overdue. In public
statements, the new Defence Secretary has made it clear that he does
not wish to lose the high intensity warfighting capability. The
author also attended the first seminar held to discuss the Review
with both the Defence and the Foreign Secretary. It was clear that
the new government continued to see the need for the United Kingdom
to play a world role. Putting all these factors together, it is
difficult to see how the United Kingdom's approach to Defence policy
is likely to change very greatly.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">For the South Atlantic, it is
likely that the arrangements in the Falkland Islands will continue as
before. While relationships with Argentina have warmed, the British
Government will maintain the defence arrangements as long as the
inhabitants of the islands wish to remain so protected. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Brazil's Defence
Requirements</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">At first site one might expect
there to be little in common between Brazil's approach to Defence
policy and that of the United Kingdom. In fact that are some
interesting parallels in the approach of the two nations. The United
Kingdom has had more than fifty years of peace without an attack on
it since World War 2. Brazil has experienced an even longer period of
peace, although it did provide forces on the side of the Allies
during World War 2. Yet both nations devoted much effort to
preparations for a possible war with a continental power. In the case
of the United Kingdom, the Cold War enemy was the Soviet Union, and
in the case of Brazil, it was Argentina that represented the
perceived threat. The coming of democracy to Russia, and the end of
the Warsaw Pact has taken away that threat in Europe; and the end of
military rule in both Brazil and Argentina has taken away the
perception of risk of war in South America. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">We have seen above how the United
Kingdom has approached the change in the security situation in its
defence planning. A parallel change has occurred in Brazil. The
National Defence Policy of November 1996 lists seven objectives:
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">a. to guarantee
sovereignty while preserving the Nation's territorial integrity,
heritage and interests;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">b. to guarantee the rule of law
and democratic institutions;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">c. to maintain the Nation's
cohesion and unity;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">d. to protect individuals. goods
and resources that are Brazilian, or under Brazilian
jurisdiction;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">e. to achieve and maintain
Brazilian interests abroad;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">f. to give Brazil a significant
role in international affairs and a greater role in the international
decision-making process; and</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">g. to contribute to the
maintenance of international peace and security.</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">These objectives are very similar
to those stated by the British Government for its defence policy. The
Brazilian National Defence Policy develops the objectives into
strategic guidance. It makes it clear that forces are required
primarily for national security, both during peacetime and in time of
conflict. The strategic posture is a deterrent one, which is
defensive in nature. It states the strategic principles : agreed
international borders; good relations with neighbouring states and
the international community; rejection of wars of conquest; peaceful
resolution of disputes; and force only in self defence.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">The strategic guidance in the
policy makes it clear that such a policy does not mean that the
forces will be equipped and trained only for defensive operations.
The need to have a capability to defeat an armed attack means that
Brazilian armed forces must be able to conduct operations which would
conclude any conflict in the shortest time and with the minimum
possible damage to national interests and integrity. Brazil is
therefore, like the United Kingdom, clear that it needs balanced
forces capable of conducting high intensity warfare if it were
necessary. Keeping up with technological developments is also seen as
an important factor:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">It is essential to strengthen the
national capabilities in the area of defence, in a balanced manner.
with the involvement of the industrial, university, scientific and
technical sectors. Scientific and technological development is
fundamental in order for the Armed forces to attain greater strategic
autonomy and better operational capabilities. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Just as the British Defence White
Paper translates its strategic policy into a set of military tasks,
so the Brazilian National Defence Policy document lists some 20
Directives . These could be broadly grouped in terms of international
roles, regional roles, national requirements, support of civil
agencies, and wider interests.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">International Roles</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">The role of defence policy in the
international arena includes contributing to international order and
sustainable development. This is coupled with a wish to improve
Brazil's negotiating capabilities on the international scene, as well
as participating in significant international decision-making
processes. Similar rationales are deployed in the United Kingdom,
which centre on the permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
Both countries see participation in international peacekeeping
operations as an important element. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Global disarmament features as a
separate international issue directive in the Brazilian policy
document. Here, while the aims are similar, the position of the two
countries is rather different. The United Kingdom is a declared
nuclear weapon state and a signatory of the Non Proliferation Treaty
(NPT). Brazil, which in the past had been seen by the international
community as a potential nuclear proliferator, has steadfastly
refused to become a signatory of the NPT. This has been somewhat
puzzling to international observers given that it is clear that
Brazil today has no intention of becoming a nuclear weapon state, and
it abides by all the constraints of the NPT regime. One commentator
has suggested that it is more a reflection of the cautious and
prudent approach that Brazil takes to the development of foreign
policy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">The policy document also
identifies Brazil's interest in the Antarctic region as a specific
item. The directive seeks to promote scientific knowledge of the
region, and also active participation in the decision making process
for the future of Antarctica.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Regional Roles</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">The directives associated with
regional affairs are concerned with the fostering of friendly and
co-operative relationships. Defence policy is seen as being able to
contribute to the strengthening, expansion and consolidation of
regional integration. The military are required to take actions to
maintain a climate of peace and co-operation along all of Brazil's
borders and to foster solidarity within Latin America and the South
Atlantic region. One method of doing this is through exchange
programmes with the Armed Forces of friendly nations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Brazil was the force behind the
founding of the Zone of Peace and Co-operation in the South Atlantic
(ZPCSA), with the first meeting of representatives in Rio de Janeiro
in mid 1988. The ZPCSA is a quite different organisation from NATO,
and has developed into more of a forum for environment and
development issues, than a collective security body. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Again, this approach to regional
security has similarities with the British approach in Europe. Of
course, the major difference is that European co-operation can be
enhanced in the security field through two existing organisations:
NATO and the WEU. Nevertheless, the United Kingdom not only supports
the efforts through Partnership for Peace (PfP), where NATO and
non-NATO nations strengthen relationships through such things as
joint training and exchanges, but it is also carrying out bi-lateral
training and exchanges. There seems no doubt that one of the most
effective ways of reducing tension and misunderstanding between
states is for their armed forces to work together. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">National Roles and Support of
Civil Agencies</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">The directives give a number of
requirements which are specific to improving national defence
capabilities. These include enhancement of the land, sea and air
surveillance, control and defence of Brazil's territorial limits.
Enhancement of command, control and intelligence capabilities is
another aspect of military capability which is highlighted for
attention. The third of these internal military aspects, which is
given a separate directive, is the requirement to improve the
organisation, materiel, training and co-ordination of the Armed
Forces. Such enhancements are common requirements amongst the
military of most nations. It is however of interest that they have
been singled out by Brazil as being of special importance. To an
outside observer, this seems to be a possible reflection of the
higher level organisation for the management of the three Services.
It is often the case that requirements for better co-ordination and
for the shared strategic assets, such as surveillance and
intelligence, reflect strong Army, Navy and Air Force headquarters or
Ministries, without a powerful overarching joint Ministry of Defence
and Joint Headquarters. In the United Kingdom, as in other NATO
countries, there has been a steady move towards the joint operational
organisation and away from the independent power of each of the
military arms. This eases the problem of deciding on priorities for
resources, and also makes for more efficient use of the available
military resources. Much work is going into the training of the
aspirant NATO members from Central Europe in this particular aspect
of restructuring their military.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">One part of Brazil is identified
as being of specific importance in the National Defence Policy. The
Brazilian Amazon is to be protected, with the support of all
Brazilian society, and a high value is given to the military
presence. The Amazon basin represents nearly 60% of Brazil by area,
yet is sparsely populated and the border is ill defined and difficult
to defend. The nature of the threat is also diffuse. The remoteness
of the Amazonian border makes it attractive for drug traffickers and
other smuggling operations. It is also a possible route for guerrilla
insurgents. From an economic protection aspect, illegal gold
prospectors may be attracted to an unprotected border. Finally, the
international community takes an increasing interest in the
management of the husbandry of the rainforests. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">The task of controlling such a
region is not an easy one, but it does provide a role for the
military, which could not be done in any other way. It is likely
therefore, that given a commonality of interest between State and
military, this will be an increasingly important aspect of
operations. The only parallel that can be drawn with the United
Kingdom in this respect is the amount of effort that British forces
deploy in Northern Ireland for the policing of one region. The
problems are very different, and the land areas involved vastly
different. Yet some 20,000 soldiers are absorbed by the Northern
Ireland counter-terrorist task. There may be a common problem in the
need in both the Northern Ireland and the Amazon task to provide
relief troops on a regular basis. This increases the drain on
military manpower.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">The directives also make specific
proposals for the support of some civilian activities. The policy
seeks to strengthen national transportation, energy and
telecommunications systems. More generally, the Armed Forces are to
maintain their participation in support activities with the aim of
national integration, and the social and economic integration of
Brazil. In addition, there is a directive to stimulate and inform
public opinion. This is aimed at encouraging a National Defence
consciousness by means of encouraging patriotism and dedication to
the motherland. These directives are somewhat different from the aims
that are found in British Defence Policy. Nevertheless, there are
some common features. In the United Kingdom, the military is tasked
with supporting the civilian authorities for the provision of
essential services and utilities, if they are interrupted by
unpredicted happenings. They do not however provide the services in
competition with the commercial sector. This difference may reflect
the difference in balance of government and private ownership of
essential services between the two countries. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Resources</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Brazil's Defence Policy statement
is somewhat restrained when it comes to the question of resources.
While all the improvements and enhancements that are required have
financial implications, there are only two of the directives which
address directly the resource allocation question. The policy
directive guarantees resources that are sufficient and continuous to
provide the means for effective preparedness of the Armed Forces and
all other entities involved in national defence. There is also a
requirement to seek a level of scientific research and development
and production capacity which will minimise dependence on foreign
sources for defence strategic resources. Both of these directives
appear to give wide scope for defence spending to rise, particularly
when taken with the other improvements that are itemised above.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">In reality, it seems that along
with Britain, Brazil is unlikely to be increasing spending on defence
significantly. The end of the Cold War, the moves towards
co-operative regional relations, and the pressures on the economy are
common factors for both nations. Brazil's recent history of military
government could make provision for the armed forces a more important
topic in electoral terms than in Britain. Yet, the signs are that
military spending will have to take its place in the queue with
competing demands, just as in Britain. President Carduso speaking at
the launch of the new national defence policy said:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">I am counting on the
professionalism of the military to reconcile defence requirements
with the availability of the wherewithal, as approved by congress.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Alliances and Security</FONT>
</H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">The major difference between the
United Kingdom's approach to defence requirements and that of Brazil
is its dependence on sharing major security requirements with other
nations. NATO was founded in 1949 with the United Kingdom as a
founding member. It has successfully prevented conflict in Europe
through the dangerous Cold War period, when forces of the Warsaw Pact
and NATO confronted each other at high states of readiness for many
years. As a vehicle for collective defence and security, it proved
invaluable. The membership of the United States, with its powerful
armed forces and strategic capabilities, was an important
factor.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Following the end of the Cold War,
many had expected NATO to fade in significance. It has however
assumed an increasingly important role in the future of European
security, and also in preparation for international operations under
the auspices of the United Nations. The question is often asked as to
what threat NATO is defending against. It no longer categorises
Russia or other countries as a threat. The organisation provides
insurance against the emergence of a major threat at some time in the
future. It does a number of other important things as well. It has
been developing links with Central and Eastern European states
including the Russian Federation and the Ukraine. Some states are on
the path to full membership of the organisation. All of this makes
for reduction in tensions between member states and improvement in
the efficiency of military forces. For UN sponsored operations, the
joint training and standards are an invaluable asset, and allow
rapidly deployable multinational forces to be put together. It also
acts a conflict prevention device between its members.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Looking to the future, there is
the question of how this type of alliance structure might develop
more into a European force as the European Union itself develops.
There have been concerns over the years as to how long the United
States would wish to stay so closely engaged in European security. As
Europe grows to be both more populous and richer than the United
States, these worries will become stronger. There is however no
agreed way ahead at present for matching the European Union economic
membership with a parallel effective military organisation operating
under a common foreign and security policy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">For Brazil, security has not been
provided by a military alliance membership. The formation of ZPCSA
was discussed earlier, but it has not developed into a collective
security organisation. Yet there are some interesting parallels in
Latin America with the European experience. Mercosur was created in
1991 as an economic community between Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and
Uruguay. The increasing co-operation on the economic side between the
members has led to better understanding of common foreign and
security policy aims. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">The particular development of good
relations between Argentina and Brazil has been the most important
factor in future security co-operation in the region. It is very
early days yet, and the difficulties that the European Union has had
in developing its security arrangements, despite a much longer
history of economic integration, should indicate that a formal
security alliance arrangement for the Mercosur countries is likely
only as a long term possibility. Nevertheless, the Brazilian National
Defence Policy has a number of initiatives, which should enhance the
possibilities for co-operation and the development of security
relationships. In particular, the exchanges and visits between
military personnel at all levels, when coupled with the day to day
activities of officials in the economic sphere, could offer the
prospect of the development over time of a more formal Alliance
structure. The first joint military manoeuvres were held in 1996 in
Entre R&iacute;os, and were compared by one commentator to the spirit
of the Franco-German co-operation in Europe.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">The announcement of a joint
declaration on security in 1997 following a state visit by the
Argentinean President to Brazil is another indication of progress.
This declaration states a common perception of regional and
international security, and establishes a permanent mechanism of
consultation for security and defence issues between Argentina and
Brazil. </FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Arms Control and Confidence
Building Measures</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">The arms control process in Europe
in the 1980s was an essential precursor to the end of the Cold war,
and the process itself was important in building confidence and
understanding. The process continues, but has to an extent been
overtaken by the other co-operative activities that are happening in
Europe as the Central and East European states come closer to the
European Union and to NATO and the WEU. There are however continuing
important roles for both the global and regional arms control
regimes, and Brazil and Britain have similar aims in this respect. We
discussed earlier, the difference of approach over the NPT, but this
is a special case. Brazil's signing of a full-scope safeguard
arrangement with the IAEA in 1991 and its accession as a contracting
party of the Treaty of Tlatelolco in 1994 put it under the same
restraints as being a signatory of the NPT. The Mendonca Agreement
has extended arms control to cover other weapons of mass destruction
in the form of chemical and biological agents. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">With arms control agreements on
the key nuclear, chemical and biological weapon systems, the most
concerning aspect of Brazil/Argentina relationships has been solved.
It is more difficult to see how conventional arms control agreements
could do much to improve relationships further. The military forces
in the region are scaled by the tasks that they are being given, and
it could be argued in Brazil's case that the forces in being (without
mobilising reserves) are small in numbers for the tasks to be
undertaken. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">The Defence Industrial
Base</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">A dilemma that faces many
industrialised nations in the post Cold War world is how to maintain
national defence industries, both for strategic and export reasons,
while the domestic weapon systems requirement is reducing. The
problem is exacerbated by the number of nations in the same position,
and the export competition becomes greater.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Britain has been very successful
in exporting defence equipment. Nevertheless, the industry has been
reduced over the years and has gone through a process of almost
continuous rationalisation. The United States defence industries have
moved quickly to rationalise their companies in order to remain
competitive on the world market. To achieve mergers on the scale of
Lockheed Martin, the United Kingdom needs to look to partners in the
fragmented European defence industries. This is not an easy prospect
as the different European nations have different arrangements of
government or private involvement in their companies. The route that
has been taken has been to form joint companies for particular
projects. The Tornado aircraft was a good example of a German,
Italian and British manufacturers co-operation. It produced an
aircraft that was required by each of the nations and has
subsequently enjoyed export sales. This formula is being repeated for
the development of the new Eurofighter 2000 aircraft with Spain as an
additional partner to the other 3 nations. Such methods of
international co-operation can be made to work, but they are
undoubtedly complex and do not allow the full economies of scale that
a single commercial company could take if it wished.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">In looking to the future of
British defence industries, they appear to be more strongly based
than many of their European competitors. The real competition to the
industry comes from the United States. There is a danger that the
very much bigger domestic military market, and the focus on high
technology solutions, will make the United States manufacturers able
to offer to undercut other manufacturers in both cost and capability.
If this were to lead to the end of national defence manufacturing
capability, it would have significant strategic and economic
implications.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Brazil also wishes to keep a
strong defence industrial base and have the strategic independence
that such a capability brings. In recent years it has shown itself to
be a leading nation in terms of the scale of its defence industries
and also the technological standards achieved. It has a successful
aerospace company in Embraer, which was privatised in 1994 and has
undergone significant restructuring to reduce costs. The Brazilian
defence industries suffer from the same pressures felt in Europe, but
given their much smaller home market find it even more difficult to
compete. The success of the EMB-312 Tucano trainer, which was adopted
as the basic flying training aircraft for the British Royal Air Force
after a fierce competition, is an indication that the Brazilian
aerospace industry can be a successful competitor in world markets.
It will not get easier however, and the need for partner companies
will become more important. In this respect the defence policy
directive which seeks to maintain a national production capability
across the spectrum of military capabilities may prove unachievable.
It could be an area for greater co-operation within the region under
Mercosur auspices.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Military Organisation</FONT>
</H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">In looking at comparisons between
British and Brazilian security arrangements, the way in which the
military is structured and controlled is an important aspect. There
have been a series of changes in both countries which affect the
costs, influence and future of the armed forces. In Britain the move
has been progressively towards structures which reinforce cooperation
between the three services and give visibility to all aspects of the
costs of defence. The aim is to produce a system where the military
tasks that stem from defence policy can be objectively quantified and
costed. It would then be possible to measure the relative costs of
different methods of achieving an objective, and optimise the force
mix to produce the most cost-effective combination. The development
of these techniques is at an early stage, and the process of
measuring defence output in an objective way remains difficult.
However, as essential part of such an approach is a strong central
control of the individual armed forces, the defence research
organisation, the equipment procurement system and the defence budget
allocation process. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Britain established a unified
Ministry of Defence thirty years ago, but it has been a long process
for it to become the powerful central organisation. The individual
Army, Navy and Air Force ministries continued to act in competition,
as long as Ministers were given specific responsibilities for each
military arm. Today, there are no independent ministries and no
Ministers with specific responsibility for each of the Services. The
Ministry of Defence is a unified headquarters and advises the Defence
Secretary on the budget allocation process for both the operations of
the Services and the new equipment programme over the next 10 years.
The individual Chiefs of the Army, Navy and Air Force play an
important role in this process, but the staffs that provide the
planning and budgetary advice are a shared resource. When considering
operational matters, they will be chaired by the Chief of the Defence
Staff. When considering resource and budgetary matters, they are
chaired by the senior non-political civilian in the Ministry of
Defence (the Permanent Under Secretary). The advice from either group
will then be considered by the Defence Secretary, who is a Minister
in the Cabinet of the Government. This system ensures that
alternatives are explored in an objective way, and that a case is not
simply made on the grounds that one particular Service should carry
out a particular task.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">In Brazil, the move from military
government to democratic government has been remarkably smooth. The
military still hold a special place in the culture of the country and
a number of factors ensure that this will be slow to change. The new
defence policy gives the armed forces a continuing interest in a
number of aspects of civil society. One commentator asserts that
allowing the military to retain control of technological and
industrial programmes constitutes a significant re-inforcing
component of military autonomy. In the writer's view, the move
towards a centralised Ministry of Defence with powerful civilian
control is the most important way of ensuring that limited funds for
defence are spent in a way that buys the greatest security for any
nation. Brazil has a Joint Chief of Staff, but retains individual
ministries for the Army, Navy and Air Force. It may be that the
Secretary for Strategic Affairs will be able to develop into a
Secretary of Defence with a unified Ministry of Defence in time.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Opportunities for Security
Cooperation</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">The analysis above has shown that
there are a surprisingly large number of approaches to security
policy which are shared between Brazil and the United Kingdom. There
are also many common interests in the security area. This suggests
that there may be opportunities for extending the formal and informal
links between the nations. The areas that are likely to be most
productive at the practical level are in military exchanges and joint
exercises and training (particularly navy and air force). There are
already a number of defence equipment co-operative ventures, and
there is scope for deepening this relationship given the
international pressures on defence industries. As the competition
between defence manufacturers intensify, there may be merit in
building on the success that the United Kingdom and Brazil have
enjoyed when co-operating in weapon system projects. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Both nations wish to assist the
United Nations to become better able to enhance international peace
and security. There are different perspectives, but nevertheless some
common ground which could be developed. The need to train and equip
for peace support operations gives a basis for co-operation. The good
relations at a personal level between military personnel from both
countries also offer the possibility of increasing joint training,
exchanges and meetings at all levels to discuss common problems. The
presence of United Kingdom defence forces in the South Atlantic may
make this easier than for many other parts of the world.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Conclusion</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">The approach to security by Brazil
and the United Kingdom in the post Cold War world has a number of
similarities. Despite the differences in size, population, economies
and geostrategic considerations, both nations have adopted
internationalist foreign and security policies. Both have a set of
policy drivers, which lead to the promotion of international peace
and security. Both consider their armed forces as an important
element in their standing in the international community. However, in
both cases, the military have significant internal tasks in support
of the civil authorities. Both have difficult decisions to make over
resource priorities. The approach taken in both cases has been to
review the aims of foreign and security policy and derive the
necessary defence force structure. In both cases there may be a lack
of willingness to fund all the necessary requirements of such an
approach.</FONT></P>
