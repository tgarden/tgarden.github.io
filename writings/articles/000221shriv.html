<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Nature of MOD</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The Ministry of Defence in Britain is a
very unusual department of State. Each of the Departments of State
are charged with advising their Government Ministers on policy
options, and once political decisions have been made, setting in hand
the necessary action to get those decisions carried out. Defence is a
prime concern of any Government, but it is one full of uncertainties.
Keeping the peace, restoring the peace, or winning a war are
activities in which judgement of methods and equipment necessary are
extraordinarily difficult.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">However the MOD is different from other
Departments of State, as they mostly hand over resources to separate
independently accountable organisations to provide the output to the
customer. Thus the doctors and nurses are employed by health
authorities not the Department of Health; dustmen by local
authorities and not the Department of the Environment; Chief
Constables and their police forces are separate from the Home Office;
central bankers work for the Bank of England and not the Treasury.
Civil departments keep the representatives of major areas of
expenditure at arms length: Department of Trade in its dealings with
the CBI, and the Ministry of Agriculture  with the farmers. The MOD
is different, because it is not just a Department of State, but is
also the Headquarters of the 3 armed services, and the Services
themselves are intimately involved in all decisions that affect them.
Whereas other departments are staffed by Civil Servants providing
advice to their Ministers, who are elected politicians, the MOD has
military personnel also providing advice.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	These military personnel bring to the MOD
a body of up to date practical experience on what particular
capabilities can and cannot do, and what risks are associated with
particular strategies. That is why current operational experience,
and frequent returns to the front-line, are important. </FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">How we got here</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	In talking about the relative roles of the
civil servant and the military within the MOD, I will spend a little
time on how the current structure has come about. This is important
partially because it illustrates the strengths and weaknesses of
different approaches, and also helps in understanding the complex
relationships between the various players. Of course it is an
oversimplification to talk only of civil servants and military. While
the statistics show just over 100,000 defence civil servants against
just over 200,000 military personnel, the numbers involved in policy
development from both categories is only a small fraction. Most of
the military are out in formations being supported by civilians in a
wide range of jobs. Indeed the number of civil servants has dropped
from over 300,000 to the 100,000 in the last 25 years as many of the
support jobs have been taken over by commercial companies. Some of
the civil servants will be scientists engaged on research, some will
be involved in procuring new equipment, testing and evaluating it.
Others will be involved in legal work or maintaining accounts and
writing contracts. I shall not be focusing on these foot soldiers of
the civil service. The relationships between them and the troops
carrying out the military operations is relatively straightforward.
The groups that I will be looking at are those within the MOD HQ and
to an extent tose in the major subordinate HQ. They are involved in
the strategic planning of Defence. So how did the current system
evolve?</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">A Century of Inefficiency</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The search for an efficient method of
strategic planning is not new. Florence Nightingale had drawn public
attention to the inefficiencies of the bureaucracy of the War Office
in the Crimea War: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">" a very slow
office, an enormously expensive office, a not very efficient office,
and one in which the minister's intentions can be entirely negatived
by all his sub-departments, and those of each of the subdepartments
by every other." </FONT></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"> If the War Office was unmanageable
internally, neither it nor the Admiralty  saw any need to work
together. While the Army kept to the land and the Royal Navy kept to
the sea, such independence could be made to work for most of the
time. However the development of the manned aircraft as a war-winning
weapon brought a new dimension to inter-service rivalry. The Royal
Flying Corps, established in 1912, followed by the Royal Naval Air
Service two years later, ensured that the development of air power in
Britain would be characterised by turf wars and a lack of planning
coherence. In 1916, Lord Curzon wrote a note for the Cabinet
explaining that we had lost mastery of the air: "The evidence is
incontestable that there has been a great lack of co-operation, and a
competition, often the reverse of advantageous, between the two
services"(5). He became chairman of a newly formed Air Board, but
within five months announced that it was impossible to develop a
coherent policy given the attitude of the Admiralty. Aircraft
production was concentrated under a single head in 1917. General
Smuts was tasked with producing a report on Air Organisation for the
Cabinet. This report led to the formation of the Air Ministry and the
establishment of the Royal Air Force in 1918. The answer to the
inefficiencies of inter-service rivalry in World War 1 was the
creation of a third service. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	There were those who looked upon the Air
Ministry as a device for wartime, and pressed for a return to two
departments of State when the war ended. It was fortunate for the
fledgling air force that Churchill was appointed as Secretary for War
and Air, which allowed him to promote his long held views about the
importance of proper management of air power. However, the disputes
were now between three rather than two services. In 1936,  the post
of Minister for Co-ordination of Defence was established with Sir
Thomas Inskip as the first incumbent.  It was the period where the 
Air  Ministry was  the major user of resources for the bomber
programme, the Royal Navy had second call on money, and the army was
the poor cousin. The Inskip report of 1937 may have changed the
priority for spending from offence to defence, but it still left the
RAF in the lead with the need to build up air defences. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Churchill's appointment as Prime Minister
in May 1940  saw a concerted effort to point all the players in the
same direction. Churchill became Minister for Defence and shunted the
individual service ministers out of the War Cabinet.  He ran defence
planning and resource allocation as a Prime Ministerial task. After
the war, this centralised control suffered a set back with the
establishment of the Cabinet Defence Committee which took its input
from the Admiralty, the War Office and the Air Ministry. Although the
Minister of Defence was the deputy chairman of the committee, the
Chiefs of Staff and the individual ministers sat on the committee and
were thus able to bypass him.  The individual service ministers had
their own appropriations and  each service went its own way. </FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Mountbatten Vision</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Suez exposed the weaknesses of the divided
organisation both in terms of planning and execution, and Prime
Minister Macmillan charged Duncan Sandys with sorting it out. In
1958, Sandys' White Paper on defence organisation (6) sought to
develop an organisational structure which would  make the defence
minister responsible for "formulation and general application of a
unified policy relating to the Armed Forces and their requirements."
A new post of Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff had been created in
1956 (Lord Mountbatten claims that he had suggested it to Eden) (7),
and this post now became Chief of the Defence Staff. The individual
service chiefs retained their right of access to the PM and their
individual ministers. This was the time of the Sandys Review, and its
projected cutback in manned aircraft for air defences did little to
help bed the arrangement down well. Sandys had a remit to cut defence
expenditure, and he took little notice of the views of the individual
service chiefs. There was perhaps more unity generated by the common
dislike of Sandys from each of the services. As a result his
proposals were watered down and progress to a unified central control
was slowed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	It was not until 1963, that a truly
unified Ministry of Defence came into being as a result of the work
of Lord Mountbatten who was the second in post as the Chief of
Defence Staff (1958 to 1965). Mountbatten argued successfully that
the individual service ministries must be abolished if the Defence
Minister was ever to be able to take control. This made Peter
Thorneycroft the first Secretary of State for Defence, with the
individual service ministers reduced to ministers of state who had to
act through the Defence Secretary. Mountbatten also intended that the
service chiefs would, in a parallel way, tender their advice through
the CDS. However the battle fought by the service chiefs was
successful and they retained their individual roles and
responsibility for military operations The procurement organisation
was also formed, and the Defence Operational Requirements Staff came
into being in an attempt to get inter-service agreement about longer
term plans. The new Ministry of Defence meant that 4 departments of
state disappeared (3 services and aviation). The Secretary of State
became responsible for all questions of policy and administration of
the fighting services. He would have 3 principle advisers: the Chief
of the Defence Staff, the Permanent Under Secretary and the Chief
Scientific Adviser. So we have here a 3 pronged advisory arrangement
to ministers - one military, one policy civil service and one
scientific civil service.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Thatcher Legacy</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The weakening of the power base within the
ministry of the individual serviceshas been much slower, but the move
from three independent kingdoms to a unified central headquarters has
continued from 1970, when the powers of the CDS were increased. The
70s saw little movement in the power struggle between the single
services and the central control advocates. It was a difficult time
with a succession of financial crises The arrival of Margaret
Thatcher as prime Minister in 1979 had a number of effects on
defence. The pay awards of the dying Callaghan government were
accelerated and defence took a higher priority in government
thinking. Nevertheless, Mrs Thatcher was not impressed by the waste
and inefficiency of the MOD. She replaced her first Defence Minister,
Francis Pym, when he did not seem to be sorting out defence to her
satisfaction. John Nott came in charged to shake up the organisation.
His Review looked to change the  traditional carve up of the cake
between the services. Keith Speed, the Navy minister, was sacked when
he spoke out against cuts to the Navy, and was not replaced. His was
the final death knell for the single service ministers, thus at last
severing the direct link between the individual services and
Parliament. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Michael Heseltine,who followed John Nott,
adopted a radical approach to defence management. His Ministry of
Defence Organisational Review was published in 1984. He had grafted
on his Management Information for Ministers System (MINIS) which had
been developed while he was at the Environment Department.   It took
little note of the single service sensitivities and was structured on
a broadly functional basis. The key change was to the
responsibilities of CDS and PUS who became jointly the principal
advisers to the Secretary of State. CDS was the adviser for military
operations and strategy, while PUS looked after political and
financial policy. The VCDS and 4 DCDS posts, the 2nd PUS with the
Office of Management and Budget, the CSA and the CDP left a rather
small policy role within the MOD for the individual service chiefs,
whose boards could provide advice to the centre. The 2nd PUS was a
member of all of the service boards to give that linkage.  The Chiefs
of Staff kept proudly their right of direct access to the Prime
Minister.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Smaller but Better</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	As the Cold War was coming to an end, the
happy days of growth in the Defence Budget was also at an end.
Whitehall was being transformed by the New Management Strategy, which
sought to align financial and management responsibilities. The
government was also intent on privatising what it did not need to
run, and making semi-independent agencies of activities which did not
need direct day to day running from Whitehall. Contracting out of
activities which had previously been undertaken by servicemen or MOD
civilians reduced the number of defence personnel - and also showed
how expensive they were. A single commercial bidder would happily
provide an operation for all 3 services, where each service may have
operated its own previously.  The Defence Evaluation and Research
Agency brought together tracts of land owned by the services with
scientists and analysts who could operate as a defence capability
rather than a single service lobby group.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	An internal study, called 'Prospect', was 
undertaken in 1991 into the need for each senior post.  The move to
aligning financial and management responsibility meant that the
separation of the C-in-Cs from the policy making board members was no
longer sustainable.  There was also a need to rationalise
headquarters to save money and improve efficiency. The Principle
Administrative Officers (CFS, QMG and AMSO) were double-hatted as the
CinCs of the logistics arms in each service. Likewise,the Principle
Personnel Officers (2SL, AG and AMP) became the CinCs of the three
personnel/training commands.  This had the effect of moving most of
the individual service board members out of London. The Procurement
Executive was also undergoing changes which meant that the the three
service Controllers  were now downgraded.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The next changes followed rapidly with 
Malcolm Rifkind's  Front Line First  defence review. There was very
much a theme of joint operations and training throughout the studies.
Thereview was designed to take the logic of the new management
strategy further:"there was still a gap to be closed between the
principles of Prospect and NMS and current practice" . Prospect had
forecast a decrease in MOD London posts from 12,700 in 1990 to 5200
in 1995. Front Line First set a target of 3750 for 1998. The OMB and
Defence Staff compartments were to be ended. It would create "a Head
Office composed of a unified Central Staff and three small
headquarters staffs supporting the individual Chiefs of Staff as
heads of their services. Further responsibilities would be delegated
to Commands".  The FPMG (Financial Planning and Management Group
chaired by the PUS) is made clearly the single key policy forum with
the Chiefs of Staff Committee as the ultimate source of professional
military advice. Front Line First also created a permanent Joint
Headquarters at Northwood.  Up until then, the appropriate service
had provided its operational headquarters for joint operations (the
Navy for the Falklands; the RAF for the Gulf War). This was a
significant stepping off point for the next stage of
rationalisation.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Modern Forces for the Modern World</FONT>
</H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	George Robertson, published the new Labour
Government's Strategic Defence Review (SDR) in July 1998. The SDR has
taken forward the development of the MOD, and reduced the roles of
the individual single services, in a number of significant ways. A
key innovation is the establishment of the Chief of Defence Logistics
post. Each service currently runs the majority of its own logistic
support requirements. There is some sharing of the less operationally
sensitive common needs, but  each service has a large logistic
expenditure. Each of the logistics CinCs has a budget of between one
and two billion Pounds  - over 20% of the defence budget in all.  
The grouping of the three service logistics commands into a single
central joint organisation is therefore a massive change in control
of resources.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	On the operational side the SDR also makes
changes designed to improve inter-service co-operation.  An important
indicator for the future is the making of the Chief of Joint
Operations into a Top Level Budget Holder, thus giving him  equal
status with the 3 service operational CinCs. The amount (&#163;M300)
is relatively small - 10% of CinC Land - but the significance is
great. The development of Joint Rapid Reaction Forces also points the
way to the immediately ready forces being under central command, with
the single services as second echelon activities. </FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000"> "The substantial expansion
in both the number and types of forces assigned to our Joint Rapid
Reaction Forces, and hence the number of operations likely to come
under the command of the Permanent Joint Headquarters, has led us to
reassess the role of the Chief of Joint Operations.......We will
therefore increase the responsibilities of the Chief of Joint
Operations." </FONT></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Current Size and Shape</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">There are just over 100,000 defence
civilians and just over 200,000 military personnel. The civil service
has reduced to this number from 300,000 in the past 25 years as many
of its roles have been moved to commercila companies. Those that
remain include scientists doing research, engineers involved in
procurement, testing and evaluation, contract lawyers and
accountants. They are the foot soldiers of the civil service with
clear tasks to support the military. The policy making staff is a
much small number with the MOD having about 3500 people in all. These
include clerical staff, so we start coming down to really small
numbers of true MOD military and policy staffs, who are there to
prepare the advice to Ministers on everything from equipment,
personnel, future programme to operational matters. The ministry has
to deal with running a war if necessary but also with compensation
claims from farmers for livestock damaged by the noise of low flying
aircraft. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Roles of Military &amp; CS</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The MOD has thus changed and evolved over
the last century. It only came into being as a unified headquarters
in 1963, and it has progressively developed to give unified advice to
the elected politicians whio in the end make the decisions. There is
a need for both military and civil service advice, but the
organisation is such that both sections are complementary to each
other in the advice they give. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The critical difference between military and
civilian role  is important. Those who have not worked there
sometimes claim that it is wrong that important military decisions
are taken by those with no military experience.  What the complainant
usually means is that he was unable to make his military case in a
sufficiently convincing way, either because the case was bad or the
argument for it was bad. The civil servant acts as the counterweight
to military enthusiasm. He must take into account the finite nature
of resources (and he has particular responsibilities in the financial
area),  the potential political implications of a particular course
of action, and the intrinsic merit of a particular line of argument.
This is the difficult stage for the military officer, but it is the
crucial one. It is no good relying on the line that military
judgement is all that matters - "Unless we have 5000 stand-off
missiles with a range of 100 miles and a capability to kill 5 tanks
per weapon by 2005, we cannot defend the nation". Many civil servants
will wish to question that judgement, and put their own specialist
non-military colouring on such a proposal. Is there another way to
kill tanks? What is the most cost effective way? Do we need to kill
tanks? Will the technology work? Will such a proposal distort the
defence budget? Why that number, why that distance, why that
capability? This is the essential part of the checks and balances
which ensure that the Defence budget is kept under control and spent
wisely. But it is not just in programming and procurement. </FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">If a military operation is under
consideration, military judgement will be crucial, but so also will
the wider political considerations provided by our civil service
colleagues.  The military advice in the MOD will need to consider
what capabilities are needed, what are available, what the military
risks are, what the options are, and what the likelihood of success
is. There will also be many detailed questions at the tactical level,
which may need increasingly these days to be considered by Ministers.
The civil service staffs will need then to provide the key political
and legal aspects in consultation with the FCO to provide Ministers
with all the information necessary to come to a decision.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The picture I am trying to develop
therefore is one where military and civilian have complementary
roles, each using his very different experience to bring together a
solution to any problem which is the best advice to Ministers. The
structure is not one of competition to give different advice to
Ministers, but of working together to provide the best and broadest
advice. To this end, we have seen over the years a much greater
mixing of civilian and military staffs. For example the Director of
Policy in the MOD is a senior civil servant, but his immediate boss
is the Vice Chief of Defence Staff, a military man, while he also has
both civilian and military staffs working for him. It is not
therefore two distinct lines of staffs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Advantages/weaknesses</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">No system is perfect. The main advantage as
I see our mix of civil servants and military officers is that each
brings a different dimension to the policy advice to Ministers. The
Civil Service provide continuity as they will tend to stay in the
Ministry for long parts of their careers. The military, if they are
to be able to give up to date operational based advice, need to
return to the frontline frequently and may spend only 2 years at a
time in the Ministry. This has disadvantages in terms of building up
effective working relations. There is one other turnover problem
which makes life difficult, and that is in the politicians. At any
one time the MOD has 4 ministers, but they tend to move on quite
quickly, and this makes continuity in policy more difficult as each
wishes to make his or her mark in office. However, that is a problem
beyond the domains of the military and the civil service.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The greatest advantage is that the system
gives very effective civilian political control of the military. In
the end the defence policy for the country is what the elected
government wish it to be. Both Civil Servant and military staff
officer are there to advise ministers how their wishes can be made to
work.</FONT></P>
