<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Over 30,000 nuclear warheads, most of them
more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb, remain ready to launch
unimaginable destruction around the globe. Yet, since the end of the
Cold War, few people give a second thought to the risk of atomic
attack.  The nuclear tests by India and Pakistan in 1998 were a brief
reminder to  wider publics that these weapons were still around. In
the United States, proposals for a "son of Star Wars" defensive
system has become an election issue, which has required politicians
to bone up on possible proliferation by Iran, Iraq and North Korea.
Yet most of the vast arsenal is held by the United States and Russia,
with the other three declared nuclear weapon states - France, China
and Britain - making a small contribution. Such discussion as there
is about how to handle the nuclear security issue remains within a
small elite. Many strategic thinkers of the Cold War have reassessed
their deterrence thinking in the light of the last decade, but they
have had only  limited effect on political agendas. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The dozen contributors to "Alternative
Nuclear Futures"  are the wise old men of nuclear thinking. They
range from Professor Colin Gray, a strong advocate of the continuing
utility of nuclear weapons, to Professor Michael MccGwire who argues
that a nuclear weapon free world is both essential and achievable.
Despite such a range of views, a reasonably coherent thread to the
argument has been achieved by the editors. The book starts with Gray
attempting to deliver a pre-emptive strike against the more temperate
contributions that are to follow. He categorises the arguments of the
abolitionists as eight nuclear fallacies, and proceeds to tilt at his
windmills with great glee. The editors, who tend towards a more
optimistic view of what may be possible in future disarmament, ensure
that the book moves progressively towards the abolitionist case. Yet
many of the chapters support some of Gray's reservations about the
practicality or desirability of wholesale disarmament. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Professor George Quester argues that
nuclear weapons will remain important to some nations for a number of
entirely rational reasons. He believes that arms control must
recognise this fact, and allow for it. Michael Quinlan, for a long
time the nuclear guru of Whitehall, dismisses the gesture politics of
nuclear no-first-use declarations. He warns against too much
enthusiasm for minimal armouries or de-alerting schemes, and is not
yet ready for a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Europe. Professor
Lawrence Freedman looks at politics of disarmament. He reminds us
that appeals for international disarmament have a long and largely
unsuccessful history. He points out that disarmament is not easy at
the practical level. Decommissioning missiles has proved to be a slow
and expensive process. He advises the abolitionists to be more
pragmatic in their approach. Making nuclear weapons of marginal
importance combined with intensive trouble shooting is a more
practical approach to the problem. He believes that there is little
choice but to contain and manage the nuclear problem for many years
to come. Professor John Baylis, as one of the editors, places himself
firmly in the middle of the book with a search for a fashionable
third way. He believes that policy-makers must try to strike a better
balance between prudence and morality. He goes further than Freedman
in his hopes that some of the abolitionist schemes, such as virtual
nuclear arsenals, would be worth exploring even if this means taking
risks. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The particular problems of the Middle East
and of South Asia are examined in some detail. Professor Karsh argues
uncontroversially that the Middle East may be one of the last regions
to negotiate away its nuclear weapons. Nor is there much
encouragement from Professor Ramesh Thakur's look at the Indian and
Pakistani security concerns.  He takes a different view from Quester
on the importance of nuclear status. He believes that both India and
Pakistan have diminished their prestige and security as a result of
becoming declared nuclear states. Professor Harald M&uuml;ller
explores the case for an incremental approach to nuclear disarmament.
He acknowledges the risks of wider nuclear proliferation, but is
optimistic about the beneficial effects of the trend towards greater
numbers of democratic states. Complete nuclear disarmament must be
the goal, but it can only be achieved by a step by step approach.

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The final three contributors to the book
were all members of the Canberra Commission on the Elimination of
Nuclear Weapons, which reported in 1996. Robert McNamara was the US
Secretary of Defense in the 1960's, General Lee Butler was
Commander-in-Chief of the US Strategic Command responsible for all
American nuclear deterrent forces; and Robert O'Neill served in
Vietnam as an Australian Army Officer, was Director of the
International Institute for Strategic Studies and is Professor of the
History of War at Oxford. The Commission concluded that nuclear
weapons must be eliminated as they posed an unacceptable danger to
the world. They advocated some immediate steps to be taken which
included  reducing readiness, numbers and types of weapons. The
immediate actions would then be reinforced by measures to reduce the
opportunities for nuclear proliferation. For the future, they
advocated the spread of nuclear- weapon-free zones and the
preservation of the integrity of the Anti-Ballistic Missile  (ABM)
Treaty. They declined to set a precise timetable for the elimination
of nuclear weapons, but advocated that targets be set to keep the
political process moving.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Butler gives a very personal view of the
changes in thinking that he, as a former air force officer, has
undergone over the years of being involved at the practitioner level
of nuclear strategy. This is an important dimension that is all too
often forgotten in arcane academic theories of deterrence. In the
end, military people have to live every day with the reality of
possible nuclear war. In his concluding chapter O'Neill examines the
increasing risk of subnational nuclear actors and why that makes
elimination more urgent, and potentially more attractive to major
powers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Since the contributors penned their pieces,
the world has moved on and not in the direction that they might have
wished. The United States seems set on a national missile defence
system which will need major  renegotiation of, or withdrawal from,
the key ABM treaty. Congress has also declined to ratify the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Russia, with its conventional force
weakness, has moved towards a greater reliance on nuclear first use
in its doctrine. It is also coupling its willingness to reduce
nuclear weapon numbers to the US moves on the ABM treaty. China,
which is given too little critical examination in the book, is also
reacting to the possible effect of missile defences on its nuclear
posture. It has also shown an increasing interest in military
operations over Taiwan. The book would have been a more comprehensive
survey if it had included the US Republican view, a Russian
perspective and a more pessimistic commentary on possible Chinese
developments. It will be a useful addition to the library of any
student of international relations, but is perhaps unlikely to appeal
to a wider readership.</FONT></P>
