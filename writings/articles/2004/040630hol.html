			<h3>Civil Service Debate -30 June 2004</h3>
		</div>
		<div align="left">
			<p></p>
			<p>My Lords, May I first thank your Lordships for the warmth of the welcome that I have experienced on joining your Lordships' House. It has been an extraordinarily pleasant experience to be introduced into the sometimes singular ways of this great institution. The staff at every level have made it their business to help, and I congratulate them all on a very modern approach to induction training. The Freshers' Fair yesterday in the Moses Room was an excellent innovation. Any faults in procedure will be mine alone given the quality of guidance that I have received.</p>
			<p>I have been fortunate that advising the Liberal Democrat Party on Foreign and Defence Policy, since my retirement from the Royal Air Force, has often brought me into contact with the work of your Lordships' House. I have been much helped by serving my apprenticeship as the research assistant to my noble friend, Lord Roper. The debates and questions in my area of interest have always been a treasure trove of information from the most well informed sources. I look forward to contributing myself.</p>
			<p>I thank the noble Lord, Lord Griffiths of Fforestfach for the opportunity to make my Maiden Speech on a subject dear to my heart: the Civil Service. I have worked with members of the Civil Service at every level both in the military and subsequently. We often focus on the relatively few senior policy makers in Whitehall, and forget that the Civil Service is still over half a million public servants operating not just at home, but around the world in the service of the nation. Out of this total, over 90,000 civil servants are within the Defence area. I have been impressed by their dedication and integrity. I welcome this debate as an opportunity to pay tribute to these men and women who continue to work in the best traditions of public service.</p>
			<p>My Lords, in order to attract recruits of the right calibre at all levels, civil service pay has had to keep broadly in tune with the commercial sector. This causes the continual problem that personnel costs rise faster than general inflation. While industry can square the circle by the use of technology to increase productivity, this is not as easy in the public service. As a result, we all seek to find new ways to cut civil service numbers. 25 years ago we had over 300,000 civil servants just in the Defence area. The reductions to less than a third that number have been proportionately much greater than the cuts in the armed forces.</p>
			<p>My Lords, I believe we need to take great care in the way that we handle the future of the civil service that we do not appear to undervalue their contribution to the nation. It is understandable that the remorseless pressure to contain public spending will focus on eliminating unnecessary costs. But in the rhetoric of cutting bureaucracy, we need to remember that the bureaucrats are there because government has brought their posts into existence. Each individual civil servant rightly has career aspirations and a sense of pride in their job.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>My lords, in the field of national security, we have seen a new transfer of the burden from military hands to the civil service. The last Defence White Paper, Cmnd 6041-I,&nbsp; of December 2003 stated that:</p>
			<p>&quot; The safety and security of the population of the UK is the responsibility of the Home Office and similar bodies and devolved Administrations.&quot; The Civil Service is now in the front line. I shall look forward to examining their role as we consider the long awaited civil contingencies bill.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;But my Lords, there is one area of the policy making civil service that has been of concern to me over a number of years. The higher reaches of Whitehall have traditionally contained some of the best intellects in the country. I recognise a number of your Lordships who fit that category. I always found it a stimulating experience to work with my civil service colleagues during my various times in Whitehall. Yet in a time when technology has an ever greater impact on policy, we continue to see few at the top of the policy making career with a scientific training. I wrote a book 15 years ago about the difficulties of making optimum decisions in defence policy. I concluded that we might do better if some policy-makers had a reasonable grounding in science.</p>
			<p>Professor David King, the Government's Chief Scientific Advisor, warned in June 2001 that:</p>
			<p>&quot;The tremendous capacity of science is not being used to assist government and policy-makers in the best way&quot;.</p>
			<p>Today of the 19 permanent secretaries only one records a first degree in a scientific discipline. In deference to the noble Lord, Lord Griffiths of Fforestfach, I would record that 9 of the permanent secretaries have qualifications which include Economics; but I shall not start a debate into whether that is a Science or an Art.</p>
			<p>My lords, we have a Civil Service that is under great pressure both in tasks and resources. We need to be able to recruit people willing to devote themselves to the development and delivery of good government. Today's Civil Service is striving hard to set an example as an employer that welcomes diversity, and is truly representative of wider society.&nbsp; We should be particularly proud of the record of integrity throughout the civil service.</p>
			<p>We need to cherish the qualities that make our civil service, but that does not mean that it should be immune to change. Keeping the loyalty, dedication and integrity of these public servants must be done, while at the same time broadening the range of expertise at the highest levels.</p>
