<P>	Tony Blair can rightly feel a sense of satisfaction that he has
come through that most difficult test of leadership - war - with
flying colours. He was resolute when other NATO leaders seemed to
waiver, and he led from the front. If Kosovo had gone wrong, the
political consequences would have been all the more severe for him,
given that he had made clear that this was a war of principle for
him. His sense of satisfaction will be tempered by the enormous
effort that was needed to keep the NATO allies pointing in the same
direction. He may have taken away a number of lessons. First must be
the limitations of the European nations, either collectively or
individually, to determine policy. NATOmay be officially a consensus
organisation, but it has an implicit qualified majority voting
system, where the size of military contribution determines voting
weight. Whether it is grand strategy (the threat of the use of ground
forces), tactical planning (targeting policy) or operational
constraints (dropping bombs from 15000 feet altitude), the US calls
the shots. With over half the air campaign sorties provided by the
US, and a higher proportion of the bombs dropped, the US policy
predominance is scarcely surprising. Nor would it matter too much if
there was clear leadership in a war situation, which gave confidence
to the rest of NATO that the operation was being managed to produce
the desired result as efficiently as possible. The checks and
balances of the US Constitution, coupled with a damaged lame duck
President, made this impossible.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Kosovo was not the first time the Tony Blair had discovered the
limitations of UK influence in security matters. The Iraq crisis
during the British Presidency of the EU should have been a good
opportunity for him to orchestrate a coherent European response.
After limited discussion, this looked impossible, and the UK sent an
aircraft carrier to join the US forces in the Gulf. The rest of
Europe noted sadly that, even with a New Labour government, Britain's
first loyalty remained to the US. Yet this loyalty, even with the
extra dimension of the Blair-Clinton relationship, did not allow the
Prime Minister to gain support in the USA for his more aggressive
Kosovo strategy as articulated during the Washington Summit. All of
this must have convinced Tony Blair that he must continue to push for
a better European Defence Capability. The extraordinary U-turn by the
UK at St Malo in early December last year  signalled the start of a
new enthusiasm for European defence. The St Malo declaration opens
with :"The European Union needs to be in a position to play its full
role on the international stage". It goes on to say:"To this end, the
Union must have the capacity for autonomous action backed up by
credible military forces, the means to decide to use them, and a
readiness to do so, in order to respond to international crises."
This is a very new policy for the UK.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	The NATO Strategic Concept agreed at the Washington Summit in
April acknowledges this new mood of co-operation in defence in Europe
and is reasonably supportive of the development. The EU summit in
Cologne at the beginning of June was an opportunity to take the work
further forward, but inevitably Kosovo overshadowed all discussion.
Nevertheless, the first incumbent of the new post of High
Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy was
announced. It is to be Javier Solana, the current Secretary General
of NATO. He is an interesting choice: a likeable politician with
great skills at achieving consensus, and a deep knowledge of NATO and
its politics. He is a good choice in terms of reassuring the US and
maintaining NATO. Only time will tell whether he is able to carve out
the necessary turf in the EU to bring some coherence to its security
planning. Already it is clear that their are different visions for
the future. Tony Blair made it clear in a speech to the RUSI at the
end of March that he did not have in mind defence forces operated by
the EU Commissioners or by the European Parliament. On the other
hand, the President- designate of the Commission and close friend of
Tony Blair, Romano Prodi, and his fellow Italian Commissioner Emma
Bonino have indicated their support for the development of a European
Army.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	There is little sign of adventurous thinking in the Ministry of
Defence in Whitehall yet. The sentiment about European Defence may be
different, but there is a striking lack of concrete proposals beyond
advice for other European nations to follow the UK lead in
restructuring their forces. The panic in government following the
recent European elections will not make it any easier to move towards
more integrated European defence arrangements. The discussion remains
mainly at the institutional level where diplomats can enjoy the cut
and thrust of debate without actually improving capability one iota.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	If the UK government is serious about getting better value from
Europe's enormous expenditure on defence, it needs to look at
opportunities for pooling national resources in the short term, and
establishing a European defence planning and budgetary system in the
longer term. Early opportunities for pooling capability are possible
for the Eurofighter, for air transport, for air-to-air refuelling
aircraft, for helicopters, for naval mine counter-measures, for
frigates, for medical services, for communications and  for army
engineers. In the medium term, there would be much to be said for
setting up common logistic support arrangements and developing a
European aircraft carrier group of say 5 ships. Only in the long term
can we conceive of a European army. The EU itself will have to
develop much more both in terms of integration but also in democratic
accountability. We do not however need to wait for that before we
establish a European defence budget to support the pooled activities.
This is the only way to reverse the decline in national defence
budgets and the inefficiencies of running tiny front line forces.
European nations have been happy to operate a supranational AWACs
force, and to depend on the US for military satellite provision. Why
then should they balk at gaining more capability by pooling some of
their military resources?</P>
