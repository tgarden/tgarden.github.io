<ADDRESS><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#000000">by Sir Timothy Garden - 30
March 2000</FONT></CENTER></ADDRESS>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The Guardian of 30 March led with the
headline "British Role in US star wars shield". This may have come as
a surprise to readers on a number of levels. First most would only
dimly recall Star Wars missile defences as one of the more lunatic
ventures of the Reagan era. Some might wonder why a possible upgrade
to the Fylingdales radar site in Yorkshire merited such prominence.
In fact, The Guardian has got its news priorities right. The US
proposals for a National Missile Defence (NMD) system are posing
great policy issues for all European governments, and some more
urgent dilemmas in Whitehall.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The US has a long and expensive history of
attempting to provide itself with defences against incoming ballistic
missile attack. The first attempts of the 60's were abandoned when it
became clear that such defences were technically infeasible, and did
no more than stimulate the Soviet Union to increase the numbers of
its nuclear tipped missiles. The possibility of multiple warhead
missiles made defences even less reliable and reduced the stability
of deterrence. In a wonderful moment of rationality, the US and the
Soviet Union agreed to the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty of
1972 which severely limited the defensive system that each side could
deploy. It was a treaty in which both sides benefited from increased
security and the world applauded the reduced impetus for a nuclear
arms race. As technology improved, industry again offered a vision of
providing leakproof missile defences, and President Reagan held out
the prospect in a speech in 1983. The Strategic Defence Initiative
(SDI) spent billions of dollars, but came no closer to providing a
reliable defence against a nuclear strikes. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The new proposals for NMD, which would
breach the ABM treaty, draw on the SDI technologies but look to a
much more limited requirement. The threat to the continental United
States is assumed to come from a "rogue state". These are normally
thought to include North Korea, Iran or Iraq. Each is expected to
have very few missiles capable of carrying weapons of mass
destruction over intercontinental distances. The technical problems
of interception are therefore expected to be much less. There is a
strong political consensus among Democrats and Republicans that NMD
should go ahead if it is technically possible. The system testing so
far has been ambiguous, and the third key interception test has been
delayed. Nevertheless, President Clinton is expected to be in a
position to make a decision by July. He may decide that more tests
are needed and put off the final go ahead for NMD until his successor
is in post.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Why is all this so important in Europe?
European governments and elites fear that undermining the ABM treaty
will unpick all the hard won achievements of arms control over the
past 30 years. It can be argued that if the US manages to renegotiate
the treaty with the Russians, there would be no such problem.
Unfortunately, the elements of the NMD system are not just minor
changes to the treaty. The thrust of the ABM treaty is to prohibit a
nation-wide defensive system. NMD also requires treaty-banned
space-based sensors and radars outside of the United States.
Europeans are torn between trying to defend the treaty status quo,
and worrying that Congress may simply withdraw from the ABM treaty.
There are also worries about what the deployment of such a system
would mean for NATO. If the US had provided for itself a shield which
was not available to the rest of NATO, would this affect the internal
alliance relationships adversely? Europeans do not share the US view
of how to handle the threat of proliferation in difficult states. Nor
do they believe that a missile defensive system protects against the
many different types of threat that are now emerging. In some
respects the long range missile threat is the least likely and
nuclear deterrence remains a sufficient strategy. The costs of NMD
will undoubtedly drain defence resources from other more urgent
needs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	One other country looks at the US
proposals with special interest. China, with only about 20 ICBMs, is
certain that the real reason for the US NMD programme is to counter
its nuclear capability. The Chinese response is likely to be to build
up its long range nuclear capability. A new arms race may
start.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Finally, for the UK Government there are
some urgent policy issues. Geoff Hoon has been recently reported as
being supportive of the US position. Fylingdales radar station and
Menwith Hill will both be integral parts of any US NMD system. The
necessary upgrades are likely to breach the ABM treaty unless it is
renegotiated. The UK has therefore some leverage with the US
government. However, it will not be enough to change the push towards
deploying an NMD capability. The UK may therefore feel that itcan
help to broker the best modified ABM treaty that it can. This is not
a role which will make many friends in the rest of Europe. It will be
seen as another example of the UK being more with the US than with
Europe. From a domestic point of view, it may prove difficult to
explain why the UK is hosting two key parts of an American defensive
system, which provides no extra security to Britain. Indeed in any
future war, we might expect these facilities to be high priority for
attack.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The Guardian was right to start the
debate. It looks as though NMD will contribute towards making the
world a more dangerous place, and the UK will find itself in a very
uncomfortable position giving practical support to the
project.</FONT></P>
