<H3><CENTER>Making the Anglo-Italian European Defence Proposals Work
</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><I>by Sir Timothy Garden</I></CENTER></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	The new British interest in trying to make European defence
arrangements more effective was underlined by the Anglo-Italian
declaration of 20 July 1999, which announced the European Defence
Capabilities Initiative. We can now track a steady progression of
British measures to put some life into the moribund area of European
defence capability and co-operation. The amazement within EU circles,
when Tony Blair launched his new idea for European security at St
Malo in December last year, has now given way to an interest in
seeing some concrete proposals from Britain rather than just grand
statements. Since St Malo, the NATO summit in Washington in April
allowed some valuable ground work to be achieved despite the summit's
focus on Kosovo. In particular the United States was just about
convinced that the new British initiatives were not designed to
undermine NATO or US influence within NATO, but might allow the
Europeans to become more serious contributors of real capability to
the Alliance. Among the raft of announcements from that NATO summit,
the Defence Capabilities Initiative gave a number of openings for the
European members to get their act together. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	The experience of Kosovo was a salutary reminder to the
Europeans of their military impotence. The EU states spend over half
as much as the United States on defence, yet relied overwhelmingly on
the Americans for the useful firepower to sort out a small scale
problem in the  former Yugoslavia. The UK was an important player
politically but could provide only 4% of the sorties flown in the air
campaign. Even its large contribution to the KFOR ground force has
had to start scaling down before the force is fully manned by other
nations. The EU summit in Cologne in June made all the right noises
about developing the European defence dimension through better
capability and more appropriate decision-making institutions. It
looked  at avoiding unnecessary duplication and strengthening the
research and industrial base. The announcement of the appointment of
Javier Solana, currently the NATO Secretary General, to the newly
established EU post of High Representative for Foreign and Security
Policy gives an opportunity for Europe to establish new mechanisms to
improve its defence efforts. Solana will come to the EU with an
unparalleled understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the
European NATO members. He will be helped by George Robertson, his
successor at NATO, who has been so personally involved in the
reshaping of the UK forces over the past two years.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	The time is therefore right for a significant move forward on
European defence. The Anglo-Italian declaration of 20 July has 
produced some concrete proposals on what needs to be done.  It has
rightly widened the requirement from a need for an EU  capacity for
doing its own humanitarian, crisis management and peace support
operations (the Petersberg tasks).  The need for a more effective
European role in NATO is promoted as a clear lesson from Kosovo. The
declaration seeks  to develop a timetable to achieve European-wide
goals for enhanced military capabilities, and a set of national
capability objectives to achieve this European requirement. The
proposal is for a peer review process with meetings of EU Foreign and
Defence Ministers twice a year to check progress towards the agreed
goals. This will take place in parallel with NATO's Defence
Capabilities Initiative (DCI) work. The DCI made the point that NATO
members would have to be able "to make a fair contribution to the
full spectrum of Alliance missions regardless of differences in
national structures." The DCI, like the Anglo-Italian declaration,
highlights the need to develop a common assessment of future
requirements. It recognises the importance of the resource dimension
as well as the need for better co-ordination between defence planning
disciplines.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	We have now, in theory, an outline plan for progress in
improving European defence capabilities in a way which works with the
grain of NATO. That is a remarkable step forward given the reluctance
of the US and the UK in past years to address these issues. But there
are many difficulties ahead. NATO would claim to have a planning
process, and to have expended much effort over the years on coercing
nations into setting more challenging force goals for themselves. To
this process, we shall now ask EU ministers to set themselves
demanding and expensive targets, most of which will have little
electoral appeal at home. The three major EU defence players will all
have difficulty in making significant changes to their defence plans
for the greater good of Europe. The UK has completed its Strategic
Defence Review and is in the middle of implementing it. The foreign
policy which drove that review took absolutely no account of these
new European initiatives. The British forces are over-stretched and
demoralised from too many post Cold War reviews. Short of a massive
influx of new money, the MOD will fight to set NATO and EU goals for
itself which match its current plans. The French are similarly placed
and are following the UK route. In Germany, the great restructuring
has still to come. Conscription is a highly political issue and its
future will be determined on national politics rather than European
defence needs. Germany has said that it will establish its own rapid
deployment capability, but it is also expecting to reduce defence
expenditure significantly. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	If real progress in improving European defence capability is to
happen, some adventurous thinking is required. The current
initiatives are worthy but are more likely to disappear into the
bureaucratic morass of the EU and NATO. There will be endless
discussions about the timetable for the target setting, followed by
watering down of the objectives to ensure they can be met. In any
event there is no proposed mechanism for penalties for those members
who fail to fulfil their defence commitments.  What is needed, as
well as all these worthy declarations, is some early signs that 
Defence is an EU activity, which is more effective and efficient when
conducted at the regional level. If nations can live with the
implications for their national sovereignty  of NATO or EMU
membership, they should be able to accept some minor moves towards an
EU military capability. One current opportunity is in the field of
airlift, which is an obvious and agreed EU defence requirement. The
UK has allocated funds for four C17 equivalents, but  terminated the
procurement competition last month. That money could be put on the
table to be matched by other EU members to establish very quickly  a
much needed force. It would also give Solana a budget to work with, a
model to trial and an example of how European defence can be more
than just a talking shop.</P>
