			<h4>Iraq: strategic drift</h4>
		</div>
		<div align="left">
			<p>On the same day that Tony Blair joins the congregation at Windsor to watch the blessing of Charles and Camilla , another 29 Iraqis die.&nbsp; A roadside bomb kills 15 soldiers, with many more injured. Four truck drivers are murdered in an ambush on a convoy travelling between Kut and Baghdad. In the capital, Sayed Fadel al-Shoq is killed on his way to a protest rally. In Mosul, an Opel car explodes killing a policeman and a passer by and wounding 14 others.&nbsp; In Mashada, a soldier and a civilian are killed by a roadside bomb. Just outside Latifiyah, five civilians are gunned down.</p>
			<p>And what does the British Government have to say? On the final day of Parliament, Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean told the Lords: &quot;I am happy to tell your Lordships that a report I received dated 5 April contained the news that insurgent attacks were down 11 per cent last week and down 26 per cent overall since the Iraqi elections. Of course all such figures have to be viewed with great caution because one never knows what is around the corner, but I believe that they were encouraging.&quot; Such reports are perhaps more encouraging to Labour ministers than to the Iraqis who have to cope every day with the fallout from anarchy, insurgency and criminality.</p>
			<p>Ever since the illegal intervention in March 2003, there have been three pressing responsibilities for the ill-assorted coalition that invaded. They needed to establish the rule of law, establish a representative Iraqi government, and repair the economy. More than two years after the war, progress in each area has been dismal. Even if the insurgency has declined marginally since its peak before the elections in January, the rise in armed criminal activity has more than offset any security improvements. Nor is this criminality confined to the Sunni triangle, it extends right across the country to 12 of the 18 governorates.</p>
			<p>The democratic process is painfully slow, and causing frustration among those brave Iraqis who went to the polls. Only in the last few days have a President and two vice-Presidents been agreed, and the transitional government should follow in the coming days. They will have to both run the country, and also press ahead with producing an agreed constitution. A plebiscite on that is due in August, with full elections at the end of the year. Almost certainly there will be further delays in this optimistic schedule.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The economy is stalled. Electricity is available only intermittently. Corruption, both domestic and foreign, appears to be a growing problem. Foreign contractors are failing to provide employment for the Iraqis. Unemployment is 30 to 40%. Education, medical supplies, water and sanitation are all problem areas, and made worse by robbery and sabotage.</p>
			<p>It is scarcely surprising that Iraqis in their thousands marked the two years of occupation with a passionate but peaceful rally calling on the multinational forces to leave. They believe that things could not be worse than they are now. They may of course be wrong if the pull out were mishandled, but it is easy to understand why they believe it. Any responsible British government would be working on a strategy to draw down the multi-national forces. Currently the embryonic Iraqi security forces have no long term force planning to dovetail with their coalition allies. The Americans still drive the agenda.</p>
			<p>Neither Labour nor Conservatives will challenge the Bush long term occupation plans. The illegal war was followed by an incompetent occupation &#150; all under the enthusiastic gaze of Tony Blair. Yet again, Liberal Democrats&nbsp; must take the moral and strategic lead. We must seek a co-ordinated drawdown of all foreign forces, in concert with a build up of Iraqi security forces. so that Iraqis can have their country back. We owe them this.</p>
