			<p>After the worst month so far in Iraq, there may be a glimmer of hope. The occupying powers have made just about every mistake in the book up until now. As Saddam fell, they allowed looting and anarchy. They had no clear post conflict plan. They changed their leadership to Ambassador Bremer, who then disbanded all the Iraqi security forces and banned previous members of the Ba'ath Party from jobs. He is now reversing those decisions. He changed his constitutional proposals three times until nobody understood what was envisaged for the 30 June transfer of sovereignty. A remarkable degree of strategic incompetence has now generated street to street fighting. Small scale guerrilla operations have grown into widespread insurgency throughout&nbsp; the Sunni triangle. The Shias, who have waited patiently for things to improve, have begun to take up arms. Civilians helping rebuild the country are taken hostage or worse.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>So what is the new glimmer of hope?&nbsp; George Bush seems to have at last got the message. that the United Nations must be central to the political process.&nbsp; At his joint press conference with Tony Blair on 16 April, he welcomed the proposals for an interim government, which were presented by the UN special envoy,&nbsp; Lahdkar Brahimi. We must all regret that this move did not happen a year ago, but perhaps Brahimi can still work his magic in the 10 weeks left until the transfer of power to the new transitional government.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The challenge is considerable. There are three key factors: politics,&nbsp; the economy and the security situation.&nbsp; The politics&nbsp; require a legitimate process towards a constitution and representative government. The economy needs inward investment, rebuilding of infrastructure, and technical assistance. The security situation must allow both the political process and the economic development to make progress. The American, British, Polish, and many other troops are there only to ensure the rule of law so that the political and economic development can happen.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The political process needs now to move ahead rapidly. Brahimi will need to bring together all the disparate Iraqi factions to agree a constitutional process, and move towards establishing the institutions for democracy in a future Iraq.&nbsp; On the economic side, generous aid continues to be needed. Rapid progress is needed to improve the quality of life throughout the country. This means finding&nbsp; jobs for the unemployed; and there is no lack of work that needs to be done. Better protection is needed for those who work on reconstruction work, and that protection needs to be extended to the repaired infrastructure. It is no good leaving pipelines vulnerable to sporadic insurgency.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Both the politics and the economics need more security, and that means more troops and police on the ground. It is not acceptable for shortage of troops to lead to the use of helicopter gunships in urban areas. Ideally, the security task should transfer from international forces to Iraqi forces as quickly as possible. However, training Iraqi police and military to operate under civilian authority cannot be done overnight. If we are not to end up with either an ineffectual or a repressive Iraqi security force, we need to give them time to learn, and not put them in the front line too soon.&nbsp; That means that more multinational forces will be needed. Keeping tired troops back from their well earned trip home, as is currently proposed, is a further recipe for disaster. By engaging the international community, through the UN, we should look to broaden the contributors. In the meanwhile, the architects of the situation, the US, Britain and Australia, will have to dig deep into their military and police capabilities to meet their obligations.</p>
