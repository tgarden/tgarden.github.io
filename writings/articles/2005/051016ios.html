			<h4>Natural Disaster: Call in the Army</h4>

			<p>The catastrophic earthquake centred on Pakistan reminds us how fragile human existence remains. Another President has to apologise for his government's failure to respond in a timely and efficient way to a natural disaster. Yet the&nbsp; changed landscapes, collapsed buildings, grieving survivors and mass death present an overwhelming challenge to any administration. Even the mighty United States floundered in its rescue efforts, when hurricane Katrina struck Louisiana last month. Natural disasters on a biblical scale seem to be on the rise. Weather related events are expected to increase in both frequency and intensity as the global climate changes. Earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions strike without warning as the Earth relieves its internal tensions. Forest fires, landslips and flooding bring regular death and disaster. Nor can we be sure when and where some asteroid may strike in future years as happened in the distant past.</p>
			<p>More people live on the planet than ever before. They live in dense population clusters looking for the economic benefits of urban life. When disaster strikes, the numbers affected run to millions. Building standards in many of the fast growing cities of the developing world are unenforced. Modern city life is one of dependence on a complex web of services to provide food, water, sanitation, heat and shelter. Disruption of these utilities multiplies the impact of any disaster. Those who survive the falling buildings may die from disease or dehydration. Does this mean that nothing can be done to reduce the consequences of such natural events?</p>
			<p>Security is a burning issue for every government today. The nuclear risks of the Cold War may have diminished but terrorism and unstable states generate enough concern for the world to pump $1000 billion every year into its armed forces.&nbsp; The capabilities generated by this extraordinary expenditure are designed for a narrow concept of&nbsp; military security. They are to be used in fighting wars, preventing conflict and securing peace. However, when natural disaster strikes, all governments look to their military for emergency help. National civilian emergency services are scaled for normal day to day problems, and are quickly overwhelmed by a major disaster. As infrastructure breaks down, only military forces have the helicopters, off road vehicles, and specialist manpower to supplement the rescue efforts. Yet there is a paradox. In many parts of the world, more people are likely to be killed by a natural disaster than are at risk from terrorism or war. Yet militaries are designed solely around the defence task. Response to natural emergencies is seen as a bonus rather than a primary task. It is time for this to change.</p>
			<p>All natural disasters have a number of common demands for which military resources are well suited. Rapid response saves lives. We have seen in the Tsunami, in New Orleans and now in Pakistan how long it takes to get help to those who survive the initial event. Some of this is because of leadership failures, but much is also the lack of information, as communications are lost. There is also the problem caused by the destruction&nbsp; to the road, rail and airports links. Professional armed forces can provide leadership, and need rapidly deployable elements for their warfighting tasks. In combat, they expect to be denied the use of normal routes such as road and rail, and equip themselves appropriately. The transport helicopter is the workhorse of modern warfare. They come in all sizes. Small helicopters can lift in reconnaissance teams to assess what needs to be done. They can rescue stranded survivors stuck in trees escaping floods in Mozambique. Larger helicopters, like the ubiquitous Chinook, can take in food, water, medical supplies and rescue teams by the tons. They can carry out survivors to safety by the scores.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>An army expects to have to deal with battle casualties suffering from life threatening injuries and trauma. Allocating priorities to save the many comes naturally. Yet the changing nature of warfare has for some advanced countries, including Britain, reduced the resources for deployable field hospitals. While there may be less call for dealing with the wounded in a war against the Soviet Union, military medical capabilities are lifesaving in any disaster zone.</p>
			<p>How then do we prepare ourselves to deal with these major disasters better? If the US, with all its military might, could not respond to a well predicted hurricane in its own backyard, what hope have the more remote parts of the globe? The first requirement is for governments to make disaster relief a primary military task. In the UK, as elsewhere, military involvement is on an availability basis.&nbsp; With the exception of our coastal Search and Rescue helicopters, no regular military force is established for civilian emergencies. Even this capability is primarily for rescuing military aircrew who have ejected. In adopting a new disaster security role, forces would have to be</p>
			<p>kept at high readiness for rapid deployment. This is expensive. Yet through the Cold War, we kept much of our military capability at very short notice and located them forward in Germany.</p>
			<p>Nevertheless, in natural disasters response time must be measured in hours rather than days if&nbsp; lives are to be saved. Specialist teams can be flown in to the nearest working airport. Helicopters are more difficult. They fly relatively slowly and may take days to deploy to distant parts. Some can be sent in faster conventional cargo aircraft, but there is a time penalty in packing the helicopter for transit and preparing it for flight at the destination. This is the reason that often civilian helicopters are hired in the region, but they will always be in short supply.&nbsp; Even when military helicopters are available nearby, their owners may believe the defence task is more important. NATO is operating in Afghanistan and could presumably have come to the aid of Pakistan. There will be questions to be answered as to why this apparently did not happen.</p>
			<p>The time has come for a global initiative. The UN should lead the call for nations to devote a proportion of their military effort to providing deployable emergency task forces.&nbsp;&nbsp; They would include helicopters, paramedics, field hospitals, engineers and infantry. The more nations that provide such capabilities, the more likely that a timely response will be available wherever a disaster strikes. Some capabilities might need to be deployed to forward areas. Regional organisations like NATO and the EU could take up the requirement to provide the more expensive specialist equipment on a pooled basis. They could also organise training and set standards so that multinational effort would be easier.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>For Britain there would be a particular problem. Although the New Labour Strategic Defence Review of&nbsp; 1998 claimed that it was promoting our military to be a force for good, events have made this ideal difficult to realise. The defence budget has seen only a marginal increase in funds, but the demands have become much greater. Operations in the Balkans, Afghanistan, Iraq, Sierra Leone and East Timor have required both a broad range of capabilities, but also an ability to sustain forces for extended periods in increasingly difficult circumstances. The policy to stay close to US force developments has not been cheap either. We currently have a situation where aircraft and ship activity is being much reduced in order to pay for maintaining troop deployments. Yet the future equipment programme looks to buy expensive new ships and aircraft. Transport helicopters are already in short supply and have been in constant use for operations. When NATO asked for helicopters in Afghanistan, the UK decided to sent Harrier ground attack aircraft instead. Movement in Iraq remains heavily dependent on helicopter operations.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>If&nbsp; disaster relief were to become a new primary task for UK defence forces, there would either have to be extra funding, or a change in the current priorities. I have argued that our defence policy is already tilted too much towards the high technology warfighting end of the spectrum. Perhaps a move towards more air transport, specialist troops and reconstruction equipment could have wider benefits. In Afghanistan, NATO is fielding reconstruction teams to help rebuild the society. Their composition is not that different from what would be needed for a disaster relief force. Thus if the UK did more in this respect, the troops would have wider utility when other units took on the short notice standby for an emergency.</p>
			<p>There will be arguments made against having forces held at high readiness which cannot&nbsp; be used&nbsp; for other operations. Yet the experience of the last year shows that there is no lack of business for disaster relief. Perhaps such a concept can be sold to sceptical governments on a different basis. An emergency response force would also be able to cope with the consequences of a large scale terrorist attack. If the warnings of mass casualties from future al-Qaeda operations are taken seriously, then every European nation ought to have an emergency relief force at readiness now. For once, military security and being a force for good in the world can be achieved with a single capability. There is still time for Britain to launch an initiative during its EU presidency.</p>
