<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">There is surprisingly little public and
political interest in the continuing military campaign in Iraq. Royal
Air Force aircraft patrol the skies over Iraq every week, and are
shot at on a regular basis. In an answer to a written question in the
House of Commons (8 Nov 2000), Geoff Hoon, the Defence
Secretary,detailed the statistics for the last six months. The US and
UK forces had been directly threatened on 55 occasions, and had
responded with some 60 tons of munitions against the air defence
systems. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The intensity of this kind of conflict is
not particularly high, but it has been prolonged.  How did we become
involved in this forgotten war?  After the Gulf War of 1991, Saddam
Hussein took repressive measures against the Kurdish population in
the North, and the Shia population in Southern Iraq.  Air exclusion
zones were established over North and South Iraq to prevent his
military from using air power to repress these minorities. These
zones were patrolled without great difficulty until Operation Desert
Fox in December 1998. This was the operation conducted by US and UK
air forces to destroy Iraq's weapons of mass destruction  facilities.
Since then, Iraq has regularly threatened and fired at the Allied air
patrols. The US and UK retaliate with attacks on air defence
infrastructure.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The UK combat commitment is some 14 Tornado
aircraft (8 bombers and 6 fighters) for the Southern zone, and some 4
Jaguar aircraft for the Northern zone. Since the end of 1998, the RAF
have launched some 150 laser guided bombs. For comparison, the Kosovo
air campaign saw them drop some 250 such bombs over a much shorter
period.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">There is no policy rationale for stopping
this operation while the Saddam Hussein regime remains a threat to
the Kurd and Shia minorities. However, as the months go by, the total
combat activity approaches that of Kosovo. Western policy-makers (and
our aircrew) must hope that the Iraqi air defences do not get lucky.
