			<h3>Danish Democracy at Work</h3>
			<p>by Sir Timothy Garden</p>
		</div>
		<p>The US proposals for missile defences, &quot;Son of Star Wars&quot; have had a relatively easy time so far in Britain: a few discussions on government policy on the Today programme, and some critical pieces in the Guardian and the Observer. The Conservative party has announced that it will support the US, whatever the detail of the proposals may be. The Lib Dems are against, and the Blair government says that it has not thought about the issue. Two European countries will be directly affected by whatever emerges on missile defences. Those with long memories will remember the promise of a 4 minute warning before nuclear annihilation during the Cold War. That warning was provided by a chain of early warning radars which looked for launches of Soviet long range ballistic missiles. One radar was located at Fylingdales in Yorkshire and another in Thule in Greenland. These radars have survived the end of the Cold War and continue to monitor missile launches in Russia. If the United States wants to defend itself against missile attack, it will need to establish a much more powerful chain of forward looking radars. It will be much easier to do this by upgrading established sites. We can therefore expect them to look to Fylingdales and Thule to be upgraded and to become a part of any future missile defence system. Britain also hosts a satellite communication facility at Menwith Hill which could become the data link for any satellite infra red detection system.<br>

			The problem with being the forward eyes of any military defences is that you become the favoured target for any enemy offensive. Thus the Danish and British governments have the interesting decision to make as to whether they are prepared to make Greenland and Yorkshire respectively a target for America's enemies. To add to their problems, the required upgrades would be in violation of the 1972 Anti Ballistic Missile  (ABM) treaty which the US and the Soviet Union agreed in order to constrain their nuclear arms race. <br>
			<br>
			
			There are therefore important national issues at stake, even if one ignores what the deployment of a US missile defence system would do to China and Russia's nuclear strategy. Both the Danish and the UK government have followed the same course of public pronouncement. They have said that since the United Sates has not yet made any formal request, no policy position has been taken. This is somewhat disingenuous as both governments made it clear at the official level last year that they would not wish to see the ABM treaty be abandoned. President Clinton remitted any decision on missile defences to his successor, and George W. Bush has put the deployment of an effective system as one of his defence priorities. In the UK, the Foreign Affairs Select Committee was surprisingly strong in voicing concerns, and in pushing the British Government to defend the ABM treaty. As usual this had little effect. It is generally assumed that Tony Blair reassured George Bush on their first meeting that the UK would fall into line over any requirement for upgrade to Fylingdales.<br>
			<br>
			
			In Denmark, they have a rather stronger belief in the importance of the parliamentary process. The Foreign Policy Committee is enshrined in the Danish constitution, even if its powers are little more than its UK opposite number. However for missile defence they are taking their concerns to the people. For the first time they arranged evidence to be taken in the form of a day long debate and seminar. Experts (including the author) from Europe, USA and Russia were invited to give views. Questions were asked by the Committee, by the press and by the Public. The whole proceedings were televised and web cast. All of this was a lead in to a debate in the Danish Parliament in the first week in May. <br>
			<br>
			
			It is difficult to know what the net effect will be. Denmark has a strong view of democracy. Its referendum kept it out of  European Monetary Union, and it used its opt out for steering clear of EU defence proposals. In one respect this makes it more dependent on NATO and hence US goodwill. It is however very keen to bring the Baltic states into NATO, and believes that missile defence proposals will make that more difficult for Russia. It is also horrified at the thought of the Americans withdrawing unilaterally from the ABM treaty. Despite Greenland being a small population far away, it looks as though Danish democracy will protect the inhabitants of Thule more than the UK will look out for Yorkshire. Whatever the discussions in London and Copenhagen, George Bush is likely to be causing public difficulty very soon.<br>
