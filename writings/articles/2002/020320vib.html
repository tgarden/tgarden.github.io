			<h3>The British Vision of the Threat</h3>
			<p>The shock of a new kind of threat emerging, seemingly from nowhere on the 11 September, has put many of the certainties about future European security in doubt. It is too soon to say whether, the mass murder of the World Trade Center attack is an aberration, or is the opening round of a new form of war and insecurity; and by how much we may now have to change our approach to national security as a result of the terror attacks. We have been passing through a time of great change in our approach to security  since the end of the Cold War. The attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon may turn out to be as much a watershed as  was the fall of the Wall here in Berlin. Certainly we need to proceed on the assumption that more terrorist attacks on the scale of New York is a real risk.<br>
				<br>
				Terrorism is not new. Virtually all governments have had to develop policies to protect their citizens from unpredictable acts of violence by terrorists. Nor did the tragic events of 11 September 2001 in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania change the risk. What changed was a much greater global awareness of the threat. It is now real and immediate, although more so to the American public than to those on this side of the Atlantic. The USA had been uniquely unaffected by international terrorism in recent years.  Yet the warning signals had been there before. The World Trade Center had already been the target of a failed bombing attack. In Europe, many governments have grown used to the need to counter their own local terrorist problems. This has been especially true for Britain with the Irish terrorism problem.  A combination of intelligence work and police activity was used to keep the level of violence to a tolerable level until some solution to the underlying problem could be found.<br>
				<br>
				Our military have been used in support of police forces in the battle against Irish terrorism, but it has not been their primary task. From the end of the Cold War, we could look back, with a degree perhaps of complacency, on a decade of military force being used to promote peace and stability overseas. The Gulf War of 1991, coming so soon after the end of the Cold War was a salutary reminder that the international system continued to need our close attention. That a major military campaign could be successful with so few casualties set the tone for western military operations for the rest of the decade.<br>
				<br>
				The &quot;peace dividend&quot; meant that most European countries cut their combat forces by around 40%. Yet the list of problems that the military were expected to sort out grew longer and longer. There were looming humanitarian crises in the Balkans, in Africa and in Indonesia. The aversion to casualties, particularly in the United States, meant that some problems could not be solved. Where sanitised warfare was possible, action was taken. The doctrine of overwhelming force, attributed to Colin Powell when he was the senior US general, developed into the practice of using the air force to win wars and ground troops to go in later and administer the post conflict rebuilding of damaged states. <br>
				<br>
				This high technology  American approach to warfare has caused difficulties in Europe. The USA is the only nation with such capabilities, and Europe remains fragmented in its approach to defence. The wars, before September 11, that we have been engaged upon are often called  &quot;wars of choice&quot;. As the gap between European and American military capability widens, the choice for European nations may more often be one of non-involvement. This in turn has led to a frustration in America<br>
				<br>
				Some believe that there would be the end of big wars that characterised the 20th Century. Yet,  the Korean peninsular is frozen in time with forces at very high states of readiness. The United States has large forces in place in South Korea. China is even more focused on reclaiming Taiwan, now that its other territories have returned. Would the US allow Taiwan to be swallowed up by military means? The security situation is Israel is very bad now, but has been a concern for years. It is not 11 September which has brought nuclear weapons to Israel, India and Pakistan, and has pushed Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia and North Korea into developing their own weapons of mass destruction. <br>
				<br>
				While I shall be focusing on the question of security at home, the wider international questions cannot be ignored. They affect the balance of resources allocated between home and abroad, they have implications for British people and business abroad. What steps the US, the UK and other nations take in continuing a worldwide campaign against terrorism will have very real implications for Britain. We cannot yet know how the US intends to continue its campaign, but it is clear that it does intend to continue, and that Iran, Iraq and North Korea are priority areas of interest for the Bush administration. The UK government is also attracted to a policy of trying to tackle the new terrorism at a distance, but this may not be a realistic option.<br>
				 <br>
				In Europe, we seem to be heading  to a state where we let the United States take the lead in military power projection, while Europe looks after the &quot;soft security&quot; issues of development aid, good government, environmental issues and support for UN activities. We should not forget that tackling poverty and injustice is another aspect of the long term causes of terrorism.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				The military planners in London, and I speak as having been one, have not been good at predicting the future. We failed to predict the Falklands, the Gulf War, the fallout from the break&#150;up of Yugoslavia, and now the terror attacks on America. I would add to that list of failures, our surprise at the speed and way in which the Cold War ended. In the dark days of the Cold War, the prospect of a war between NATO and the Warsaw Pact was so awful that we (the nations of the West) were prepared to field quite significant military forces at considerable cost. In the UK we thought nothing of spending 5% of our gross national product every year on defence. On that scale, we could cope with lesser challenges when they popped up. Now, the situation is very different. We grudge spending even half that proportion of our national budget on armed forces.<br>
				<br>
				A public document - called the Future Strategic Context for Defence &#150; was published by the UK MOD in February last year. This document concluded that the worst case contingency for the planners is a British contribution to a war on the scale of  the Gulf War. It discounts a direct military threat to the UK. Yet the author cautions that the analysis cannot predict shocks &#150; &quot;low probability events with a dramatic impact&quot;. The co-ordinated attacks on Washington and New York with mass casualties and an unseen enemy are presumably just such a shock. We cannot know how events will play out on the international scene over the next five years. It may be that we have moved back into an era of risk and vulnerability like the one that we lived through in the Cold War, where such attacks with mass casualties become a regular feature. What is clear to me is that the risks of security failure increase as we in Europe allow our military  and other security capabilities to atrophy. We are demanding much from our troops today: in Bosnia, Kosovo, Macedonia, over Iraq, in East Timor, Sierra Leone, and now over Afghanistan. At home, we turn to them for help in flooding or in foot and mouth. Our own terrorist threat in Ireland still absorbs them (although that now looks more hopeful), and to all of that is added the new international terror threat. These are dramatic times.</p>
			<h3>Tackling Terrorism</h3>
			<p>Terrorism was with us long before 11 September 2001, some of it motivated by local political aims, some by single issue fanaticism, and some by unfathomable beliefs. Suicide bombers are not new. What is different is the targeting on a global scale of targets designed to cause casualties without limit and to undermine the global economy. They might be called strategic acts of destruction, rather than the tactical terrorist acts of the past. While it may have been possible for the international community to live with occasional acts of local terrorism around the world, it is not possible to live with non-state actors who have a mission to destroy the global system.<br>
				<br>
				The most effective approach remains very much the same as in more traditional counter-terrorist campaigns. The priority must be to defend the most vulnerable targets and to arrest the in-place operatives before they can carry out new atrocities. These are jobs which belong primarily to the intelligence and police agencies around the world. Sharing information on a global basis is the only way to respond to a global threat. This is very difficult for intelligence organisations who, with a few exceptions, are not used to sharing their secrets. However much progress is happening in this area. Making international police action easier is also important, and the EU mechanisms are helping in this respect.<br>
				<br>
				 The second priority in defence terms (but it is rapidly becoming the first priority in political terms) is finding and eliminating the direct supporting infrastructure of the sponsor of terrorism. This is always difficult, but is especially so when head office was located in the wild country of Afghanistan.. Nevertheless given good intelligence, carefully targeted air attacks and small but capable western ground forces, co-operating with indigenous forces, the bin Laden infrastructure has been effectively dismantled within the borders of Afghanistan. Capturing bin Laden himself continues to depend on good luck as much as anything, and is of little relevance to the continuing threat. The security problem in Afghanistan is now more about rebuilding it to be a functioning state for the future, rather than its role as a source of terrorists. <br>
				<br>
				Success in the military campaign  has not removed the threat from the already trained and deployed terrorists. Some assessments put the number of men passing through the terrorist training camps as in excess of 10,000. Bringing al-Qaeda members, captured in Afghanistan, to justice is important, but we should not delude ourselves that the world will return to normal just because we have done that. Indeed if we do not do that in a way which appears fair and just to the rest of the world, we may make the situation worse in the future. Observation of international law norms is an obligation on all nations, including the US.</p>
			<h3>Implications for Britain</h3>
			<p>The academic community has been warning of the new age of asymmetric warfare since the end of the Cold War. Critics of expensive high tech military capability have warned that western powers are increasingly vulnerable to unsophisticated attacks by determined non-state actors.  The weapon of the terrorist has been the crude bomb for more than a century, and yet its effectiveness has increased as commercial and government infrastucture becomes more complex. But the assumption has been that terrorists will tailor their actions to further their political ambitions. This calculus changes if the aim of the terrorist is entirely the destruction of western society.<br>
				<br>
				The events of Tuesday 11 September demonstrated that it is now possible to cause mass destruction (in the technical sense of thousands of immediate casualties), economic panic  and the dispersal of the main organs of government with no more than a Stanley knife. The skies are filled with thousands of airliners at any given moment. The dangers of aircraft crashes from normal operating risks are well understood. Every flight safety precaution is taken in ensuring that each aircraft is properly serviced and operated through an international certification system. The risks of acts of terrorism directed against civil airliners and their passengers are also well known. Disasters still happen as the Lockerbie bombing demonstrated. Hijacks are much less frequent than in the past, but still occur from time to time. The measures which the international community some twenty years ago took in the light of a rash of hijacks and threats to aircraft safety have been reasonably effective. The measures have been multi-faceted. The intelligence community has devoted its efforts to counter-terrorism. Airport preventative security measures have become near universal. Hand baggage is scanned, passengers pass through metal detectors, luggage in the hold is examined, and vetting measures for airport personnel have been strengthened. Nations have agreed to deal with every case of hijacking in a severe way, so that potential future hijackers are deterred. While none of these measures provides total assurance, the overall effect has been a considerable decline in such incidents in recent years.<br>
				<br>
				The use of a hijacked airliner as a weapon of mass destruction is a new and devastating development. Deterrent measures can have little effect on fanatics who rejoice in their own death. The focus must therefore be on preventative measures for the future. The elimination (if it is possible) of those behind the events of 11 September will not stop others  attempting to emulate this terrible example.  Indeed, we should be concerned that copy cat incidents by deranged people may now be an additional risk. The US has even seen one such event in Florida already with the young boy piloting his light aircraft into a tall building.<br>
				<br>
				While measures such as these can address the  suicidal aircraft attacks, they do nothing to reduce other major terrorist threats.  The perpetrators of the 11 September atrocities are different from the traditional terrorist group who seek to use threats to make political gains. In this case the terror is an end in itself. The destruction of western power is the motivation. This means that we must  expect other means to be used, regardless of the potential number of casualties. Biological weapons attack becomes a real and urgent threat, and the delivery means may be by a single person willing to die for the cause. Against such threats, deterrence and retribution have little hope of success. Radiological attacks (that is causing the spread of radioactive substances) are also likely.<br>
				<br>
				In the military and diplomatic field a difficult two pronged approach will be necessary. The remaining  members of this terror group must be identified and removed from action. At the same time, the attractions of becoming a member of such a group must be reduced. Good intelligence is the key to any operation. In order to get intelligence quickly, the  West will need to seek the co-operation of the states which have in the past hosted terrorist factions. This will be a difficult trick to turn. If the whereabouts of the perpetrators are identified, the whole international community can move effectively. An alliance of many nations would support the USA in taking necessary action to extradite, eliminate or capture those responsible. If a more general military campaign is launched against those states, which NATO classifies as supporters of terrorism, then the outcome will be much less satisfactory. Whatever the outcome of such a campaign, the world will be a less safe place for everyone in the future. Difficult as it is, this is a time to build alliances and take joint action as American, European, Arab, Asian and African partners against a universal threat. UK foreign policy is directed towards this.<br>
				<br>
				We also need to take measures at the local level to reduce the risks, and also manage the consequences when an attack is successful. As members of the business community, you have an important role. I trust you already have safe redundant arrangements for preserving your electronic data from destruction. Do you take as much care with preserving your equally important asset of your people? Evacuation drills for buildings need to be taken seriously, and practiced properly. Training in first aid is important. It may even be if such attacks become more frequent, companies will need to move towards more dispersed operations with key workers separated physically. We are not at that stage yet. We are all going to find that life is more difficult in terms of security checks. Getting the balance right is difficult. Security checks are to make you more secure, not to keep up appearances. <br>
				<br>
				Governments have a problem with tackling the new threat. Most of the measures to be taken are best kept secret. Yet the public needs to be reassured. Getting the balance between risk and freedom right is another problem. </p>
			<h3>How prepared is Britain?</h3>
			<p>In trying to make an assessment of Britain preparedness for a major international terrorist attack, we can take some comfort from the years of experience of the mainland campaign by Irish terrorists. The government, the police, the intelligence services and the military are well practiced in domestic counter-terrorism. The concerns come when one looks at the possible scale of this new form of terrorism. While local terrorist movements can carry out atrocities, they do attempt to keep some section of public opinion sympathetic to their cause. This limits the scale of their attacks. If we think of some of the more obvious possible strategic suicide terrorist attacks that could be mounted against targets in Britain, then we would be looking at a disaster on a scale not seen since World War 2. <br>
				<br>
				We also have targets today that have possibly long term effects on society's ability to function. Nuclear facilities are a particular concern, but there are also concentrations of government and commerce in quite small areas. When we planned for a recovery after a nuclear attack in the days of the Cold War we had a complex organisation of civil defence and dispersed government in waiting. All this has been dismembered. The Defence Select Committee in its report of December 2001 concluded that we should be prepared for attacks which generate large numbers of casualties. Other types of attack, like cyber warfare, might only be expected as a secondary event. Chemical, Biological and Nuclear attacks were risks that could not be ignored.<br>
				<br>
				The United States has taken the problem very seriously. The US Director for Homeland Security has responsibilities for counter terrorism aspects of: detection, intelligence, surveillance, plans training, exercises, evaluations, law enforcement, weapons of mass destruction consequence management, vital installations, borders, territorial waters, airspace, transport security, research, public health, threat response, incident management, economic consequences and public information. That is quite a list and involves the whole of government and local government. In the UK we operate on a Cabinet led committee system co-ordinating the work of different departments. There are some worries that this may not have sufficient power to take difficult decisions on resource priorities. It is expecting a lot of &quot;joined-up government&quot; to move resources between departments ahead of an unknowable probability of attack. Some extra money has gone to the police, intelligence and defence, but it is small change compared to the US proposal for an increase of $48 billion to meet the new challenges.</p>
			<h3>Timescales</h3>
			<p>Some in Government appear to hope that the threat to the UK can be eliminated by addressing the causes of terrorism and by military action overseas. This is likely to be over optimistic in the near term. As we have seen in Ireland and in the Balkans, it takes generations to change the way people feel. There is no chance of identifying and finding all those who have passed through terrorist training camps. The al-Qaeda operations in the US had been planned and developed over a period of perhaps 4 years. It appears that the targets chosen are both symbolic in terms of Western power, and liable to generate mass casualties. Over the coming months, similar attacks remain possible. In Britain, London is likely to contain most targets that fit the bill, but it also has the best practiced defensive and consequence management measures. <br>
				<br>
				The British government has tried not to be alarmist, and work on developing new policies has progressed rather more slowly than might have been expected. The Ministry of Defence launched a discussion document in mid-February on the possible changes in policy needed in the light of 11 September. It is expected to come to some conclusions in the middle of the year. There is no great push to spend large amounts of public money on new measures. This rather restrained approach may be complacency, or  a belief that there is little that can be done.</p>
			<h3>Disaster Recovery Response</h3>
			<p>If a major attack were to happen in the UK in the near future, the immediate response would be done by the emergency services in the locality. Counties appoint emergency planning officers who look at contingency plans for disasters. They have certainly been reconsidering them in the light of the new terrorist threat. But it is a daunting prospect. If biological, chemical or nuclear material were involved, there would be a need for the police, fire and ambulance workers to operate in protective gear. It is not clear that sufficient of this is available. There is a wide range of policy questions about the availability of vaccines for possible biological warfare agents. The military are better trained and supplied than most with the necessary detection and protection equipment, but it may be deployed overseas.<br>
				<br>
				I do not wish to raise unnecessary alarms about the level of preparation countrywide, but the difficulties of managing the foot and mouth outbreak perhaps gives a hint of what might happen if smallpox were used as a biological agent by terrorists.<br>
				<br>
				All that said, the most likely attacks will remain those using explosives, and the precautions taken for our own domestic terrorists help in this respect.</p>
			<h3>Business Implications</h3>
			<p>I was asked to look at the implications for business. I am sure you can speculate about those for your own company much better than I can. My message is that the threat of further international terrorist attacks is real, but of course the specific threat to any individual or company remains tiny. While 3000 people killed in one event is a terrible thing, the risk divided among the population of the USA is minute. You need to address this risk as you do any other commercial risk. Different companies will come to different judgements.<br>
				<br>
				Doubtless those with offices in Canary Wharf will feel a little more at risk than those who operate out  of low rise sheds dispersed in rural areas. Those next to nuclear storage areas might share an unease with those close to refineries. There are some low cost measures which are sensible to take for reasons beyond the fear of terrorist attacks. Protecting key personnel and data is perhaps the most important for the survival of any business after a disaster. This means having alternative secure data storage at a remote location. While air travel is as safe as ever, it is foolish to put all your key people on the same flight. Security of entry to the company needs to be taken seriously. Evacuation drills are important. Talking to your local emergency planning officer might be sensible. All of these low key measures will also reassure staff that their safety is being considered. The development of disaster recovery plans need to take into account the possibility of a terrorist attack.</p>
			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>We are moving into a new age of uncertainty, where random deaths from terrorism may be a more regular occurrence than in the past. With terrorists seeking to generate mass casualties and destroy the economy, business is in the front line. Yet we lived through the Cold War when we faced a much more terrible risk of a nuclear war, and we survived and went about our lives. Getting the balance right is difficult. As you will gather, I worry that perhaps the UK is moving more slowly on the home security front than it should. For you as businessmen, the precautions you should take are sensible ones that will reduce risks from a range of disasters.</p>
