<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=4>Land Warfare</FONT></P>

<P>In the nuclear superpower age, it was all too easy to dismiss land
warfare as of decreasing importance. High technology seemed to offer
more and more for the world's navies and air forces, while armies
remained equipped with weapons little different from those used in
World War 2. Yet armies still make up the major element of nations'
military might. Significant changes in army methods of operation have
followed technical developments in the past, and an examination of
these will indicate the most likely areas for future innovation.</P>

<P>In early days land warfare was comparatively small scale. One
estimate of the total killed in war in France, England,
Austria-Hungary and Russia between 1101 and 1599 comes to just over
one million men. The comparative figure for the 17th Century alone
was 2.5 million, rising to 3.6 million for the next century.(1).
Weapon development was directed towards increasing the range of
action of weapons, increasing the effectiveness of the weapons and
increasing the rate of weapon delivery. The longbow gave the English
at Crecy in 1346 a crucial advantage over the French forces. Yet the
bow was not a novel technical breakthrough: its successes in the past
had been largely ignored. Indeed it is surprising how often weapons
which alter the whole conduct of land warfare are not the
technological novelties, but the thoughtful application of well
understood techniques. Gunpowder gave hand guns, cannons and rockets
to increase range and firepower from the 14th century onwards.
Experience in combat, progress in chemistry, mathematics and
engineering, all improved armies' killing power. As with maritime
warfare, the more significant technological advances date from the
beginning of the last century.</P>

<P>By the early 1800s infantry were equipped with inaccurate and
expensive muskets, which took a considerable time to reload between
shots. Advances in chemistry at the turn of the century had produced
fulminates of silver and mercury: explosives which detonated when
struck. Their use for igniting the powder in the gun barrel much
reduced the incidence of misfires in flintlocks. Once the
cylindro-conoidal bullet had been designed in 1823, it could be
coupled to the percussion cap to make the rifle bullet (2). A gun
which fired a bullet which sealed itself into the bore, which was
rifled, offered greater range and accuracy with quicker loading.
Improvements in manufacturing technology allowed breechloading to
become practical and dramatically increase the rate of fire. The
industrial revolution was also changing the way in which such guns
could be produced. Instead of the handcrafted individual weapon, the
mass production of standard parts became the norm. The cost of
weapons could decrease as their effectiveness was increasing. The
American Civil War demonstrated the power of these new infantry
weapons. The repeating rifle improved rates of fire yet further, but
brought with it the penalty of much greater ammunition requirements.
Already it was becoming apparent that the vulnerability of the horse
and rider to long range rifle fire had made the cavalry obsolete.
</P>

<P>The repeating rifle offered the prospect of yet more concentrated
fire if the reloading requirement could be reduced, and if the rate
of fire could be increased. During the second half of the 19th
Century work was done on both these aspects. The French produced a
37-barrel gun, which weighed one ton, and could deliver its load of
10 shells per barrel in one minute (3). Richard Gatling produce the
first machine gun in 1862. This multi-barreled weapon used a purely
mechanical action to load, fire and eject spent cartridges. The
energy to activate the mechanism was provided by a hand crank. Hiram
Maxim contributed to the further development of the machine gun by
adapting it so that the recoil energy from each shot was used to
operate the mechanism. This was the first automatic machine gun. The
century had seen rates of fire improve a thousand-fold.</P>

<P>The innovations in the design and the development of infantry
weapons were also incorporated in artillery guns. Rifling of barrels
and breech-loading improved accuracy, range and rate of fire from the
middle of the century onwards. Science was providing a greater
understanding of the physics of the guns, and better materials and
manufacturing processes. The strength of the barrels was improved
while the overall weight could be relatively less. Guns became more
powerful and more mobile. It was late in the century before
satisfactory recoil mechanisms were adopted, which allowed the gun to
absorb the reaction to the firing of the shell and return to the
firing position. Such mechanisms allowed increased rates of fire.
Mathematical work on ballistics theory improved accuracy. Although
Shrapnel had filled a hollow shell with shot in 1784, it was nearly
another 70 years before a reliable fuse was perfected (4). One
further development improved artillery effectiveness: the invention
of smokeless powders. The lack of smoke from propellants such as
cordite aided concealment of gun positions, and reduced obscuration
of targets. More importantly, the new powders were slow burning. This
meant that pressures rose progressively and barrels could be longer
and bores be larger. Range, accuracy and firepower all benefited. The
new opportunity to fill the projectile with a high explosive charge
further increased the destructive power.</P>

<P>Guns could fire shells weighing 12 lbs each at a rate of 20 shells
per minute. There were large numbers of guns available as
manufacturing processes became more standardised. The ammunition
requirement for any campaign became a crucial factor in planning. One
apparently non- military invention was to have dramatic strategic
significance in the moving of men and materiel for war. The Stockton
to Darlington railiway opened in 1825, and the railroad spread with a
speed characteristic of commercial rather than military progress. The
military were slower to realise the contribution that the railroad
could make to their deployment and logistic support plans. The
strategic use of railways in the American Civil War (1861-5) and the
Austro-Prussian War of 1866 showed that great advantage could be
gained by the imaginative use of these fast supply lines, which can
carry large quantities of cargo. In 1870 von Moltke, the Prussian
chief of the General Staff, mobilised and moved three armies,
totalling 384,000 men, to face the French west of the Rhine in just
18 days. With the railroad it became possible to envisage supporting
massive operations at considerable distances. At the same time,
armies could become dependent on these fixed and known lines, and
hence were vulnerable to counter-measures taken against the
railroads.</P>

<P>The telegraph paralleled the railroad in its development both
chronologically and geographically. Once Samuel Morse had convinced
the doubters of its merits, commercial interests ensured that the
telegraph spread rapidly, particularly in expanding North America.
The military advantages of instant communication are enormous. When
communication is at the speed of the horse and messenger, plans must
be rigid and rapid reaction to changing circumstances becomes
impractical. With the aid of the telegraph, strategic information
about the actions of the enemy could be passed in time for preventive
action to be taken. Public information about the course of battles
became available from war correspondents. Commanders could apply
reserve forces at all levels in a much more effective way. Large
forces could be controlled. Artillery fire could be directed on to
targets by direct communication between spotter and battery. The
telegraph and telephone (1876) quickened the pace of warfare by
shortening response times and increasing flexibility. Coupling this
speed of information communication with the effect of the railroad on
speed of movement, the nature of land warfare is changed in scale by
two primarily civil inventions.</P>

<P>Just as steam power, diesel engines and eventually nuclear plants
transformed the nature of naval warfare, the move from animal power
to mechanical drives revolutionised land operations. Steam power
influenced strategy because the size of the engines restricted
employment on land to the railways. Logistic support plans had
therefore to follow the routes of the railway lines. Work in the mid
19th Century led to Nikolaus August Otto developing a four stroke
internal combustion engine by 1876. The early engine-driven Benz four
wheel automobiles were marketed from 1890 onwards. The motor car was
a commercial proposition. Yet the application of this technology to
warfare seems inexplicably slow in retrospect. All the components for
the tank had been invented by the turn of the century, and the basic
concept was centuries old, but it would be the middle of World War I
before they would be assembled and fielded in battle. Artillery would
continue to be dragged into position by horse, and men would march
unprotected to their fighting posts.</P>

<P>The credit for the eventual production of the tank goes to the
persistence of Colonel Ernest Swinton of the British Army (5).
Despite War Office antipathy, but with the support of Winston
Churchill (and the Admiralty), work progressed from 1914 onwards. The
use of tanks at the battle of Cambrai in 1917 was every bit as
significant in the history of land warfare as the longbow had been at
Crecy. The stagnated trench warfare of the war could be ended by the
new weapon system. Armoured vehicles with caterpillar tracks for
cross-country capability, and integral firepower could provide
offensive action which would break through heavily defended
positions. Even these lessons were not absorbed quickly and the full
potential of the tank was not exploited during the war. The 540 tanks
of the British used at Amiens on 8 August 1918 made it a decisive
victory, and brought an end to the stand-off debilitating warfare of
the past four years (6).</P>

<P>What was it that made World War I the succession of stagnated
defensive battles? The machine gun had been adopted widely by all
combatants, and could be produced in large numbers. The
industrialisation of society allowed armament to be produced in
continuous and unprecedented quantities. The railways delivered men
and ammunition endlessly into the war. As importantly, the low
technology of preparing defensive positions had a critical influence
on the nature of the warfare. Barbed wire had been patented in
America in 1867, and the copious quantities needed to tame the West
led to cheap manufacturing processes. The low cost, ease of
emplacement and effectiveness in slowing infantry movement of barbed
wire defences allowed the machine gun to prevent forward movement.
With no counter to these prepared defensive positions, and the
massive use of artillery leading to the universal use of trenches,
offensive action led inevitably to casualty figures never previously
contemplated. Mass production had led to mass destruction.</P>

<P>One technological approach to overcome the impenetrability of the
defence was the use of disabling chemical agents. Despite the
international prohibition on the use of poison gases in the Hague
Convention, the first gas attack was made against the Allied forces
at Ypres on 22 April 1915. 5000 casualties and the loss of 60 field
guns was the result (7). The use by both sides of chemical killing
and incapacitating munitions escalated rapidly (8). What was a novel
technological breakthrough did not lead to a strategic advantage. The
countermeasures of gas masks and protection reduced what was already
an imprecise weapon to a level of effectiveness somewhat less than
that of conventional artillery. The unseen killer gas did have
profoundly greater demoralising effects on troops under attack, than
did the more obvious - and lethal - high explosive shells.</P>

<P>Technology had provided one extra element to the land battle in
the run-up to the first world war: the aeroplane. How that affected
warfare is considered in the next chapter; but in the context of the
land battles of World War 1, it was another potential war winning
element which suffered from lack of exploitation. Inventions which
had enjoyed success and development from civilian manufacturers for
commercial reasons were not adopted with sufficient imagination to
change tactics. Where science was applied, it was to increase the
destructive power of artillery, the rate of fire of infantry, and the
killing power of munitions. The need to harness and exploit already
developed civilian novelties such as the motor car, the tractor and
the aircraft was only slowly appreciated. Yet these devices held the
key to new battlefield tactics, which could have broken the stalemate
of trench warfare.</P>

<P>If limited use of tanks had ended the apparently unendable
conflict, it was scarcely surprising that the next two decades would
see much thought devoted to the role and improvement of the armoured
fighting vehicle. It is interesting that there are a number of
examples of such high priority development in the light of only
slight combat experience. These include the pre-World War 1
battleships, the strategic bomber after the 1917 air raids on London,
and nuclear weaponry after the 1945 attacks on Hiroshima and
Nagasaki. The inter-war period saw strong advocates of the importance
of armour in future conflicts (9). The western establishment was
orientated towards peace and disarmament; views which did not sit
well with the development of such an overtly offensive weapon as the
tank. Emphasis was given to defensive measures and the use of the
tank in support of the infantry. In Germany the climate of opinion
was markedly different. Looking for a rapid offensive capability,
they saw the use of tanks and motorised infantry as of first
importance. The new tactical doctrine of Blitzkreig sought to achieve
rapid breakthrough using armour supported by air power. Tanks
developed through improvements in engines, guns, gyroscopic
stabilisation of weapons, and armour.</P>

<P>What research was there into measures to counter the power of the
tank? Field artillery had been used in this role in World War I, and
specialist guns were developed with sufficient power to penetrate
armour in the inter-war period. It was to be 1942 before the infantry
began to gain an effective anti-tank capability with rocket propelled
launchers. Land mines were made more effective, but still required
laborious preparation and remained a defensive rather than offensive
weapon. Indeed it was improvements in defensive measures which
engendered most interest amongst the Allies. The Maginot Line of
defensive fortifications in Europe used massive engineering works, in
order to provide an inpenetrable wall against an enemy using World
War I tactics. Technology could provide such a barrier, but when the
nature of warfare was not as predicted, such a magnificent static
system of defence had little relevance. In modern day jargon, the
utility of the fortifications was very scenario dependent.</P>

<P>So what was technology offering the land forces for World War 2,
and how did the promises match performance under combat conditions?
Motorised transport had become universal in the inter-war period, and
thus men and stores were less constrained to the straight lines of
the railways. Communications had made great advances. While wireless
telegraphy was widely available in the previous war, the full
exploitation of radio had to await the development of radio
transmission and reception techniques based on thermionic valves. The
triode valve had been invented in 1906 and modulation of radio
frequency carrier waves by audio signals demonstrated. The British
Army formed its first wireless company in 1911; but the
transmitter/receiver weighed 2 tons and was horse drawn. The rapid
development of radio-telephony owed more to the commercial pressures
of broadcasting than military research in the immediate post war era.
Mass markets for radio receivers brought down costs as performance
improved. Amateur and professional users explored the propagation
characteristics of different frequencies under changing ionospheric
conditions. By 1939 the radio receiver was a familiar household piece
of apparatus, and the developments in thermionic valves had allowed
both powerful transmitters and sensitive receivers to be mass
produced. For the army portable radio equipment was standard.</P>

<P>The ability for higher formation to communicate with lower, and
for commanders to talk directly to their troops, and all that at the
speed of light, was the key to capitalising on the new mobility and
flexibility of motorised forces. This was an area of development
which was recognised to be important. Commercial exploitation of
radio (and in time television) led to reduced production costs and
improved reliability. Realising the advantages to land forces of
radio communications, it would have been productive to devote equal
effort to methods of denying such communications to an enemy.
Nevertheless, considerable success was achieved through interception
of radio messages as an intelligence gathering method. Technology had
provided a new capability to control forces in short timescales, but
was also to make armies dependent on a medium which could be
intercepted, located and eventually disrupted. In the area of
munitions, inter-war development was mainly incremental.
Manufacturing techniques were improved and coupled with better
designs improvements in accuracy and reliability were achieved. While
radar was of great significance to both the sea and the air battles
of World War 2, the problem of clutter from ground reflections of
radar waves meant that it was not used for the detection of enemy
land forces. One important use for radar over land was found. In
1942, the first tests were conducted of shells containing their own
radar such that they could accurately measure their height above the
ground. The altitude measurement was used to explode the shell at
preset low height above the ground to give maximum fragmentation
effect. Shrapnel s work of the 18th Century was coming to fruition.
Such proximity fused shells proved extremely effective against German
troops from the end of 1944 onwards.</P>

<P>The artillery itself had not increased in calibre, but new fire
control systems improved accuracy and reliability. Motor transport
ensured rapid resupply of ammunition, and gave mobility to artillery
batteries. Fire control and radio gave much greater scope for
accurate coordinated barrages using dispersed batteries against a
common target. The Russians brought back the long out of favour
rocket as a major contribution to artillery firepower. Trucks carried
12 or 16 rocket launchers which could be used to fire a salvo.</P>

<P>The tank had spawned special purpose variants to clear minefields,
provide engineering support and some with light armour to improve
speed and manoeuvrability. Infantry could be transported in armoured
vehicles. Surprisingly, the development of the tank in the inter-war
period had not generated a range of effective anti-tank weapons,
apart from the tank itself. Indeed development of counters to tanks
in general was an area in which research could have paid great
dividends. Work on the shaped charge, with its high penetration
ability against armour plate, and the use of high velocity guns and
the development of the bazooka during the war redressed the lack of
earlier work to some extent. However, in the early days of the war
the combination of tanks and aircraft in fast moving coordinated
offensive thrusts proved to be highly successful in achieving rapid
advances. Technology had provided the wherewithal for a new tactical
doctrine of Blitzkreig, and the defensive palliatives of the last war
were inadequate to meet the new challenge (10).</P>

<P>Technology had also been able to provide improvements to defensive
equipment. Mass production techniques had made large quantities of
land mines available. Minefields could be laid rapidly, and were
increasingly difficult to clear. They were used to slow enemy
advance, or in the case of forces such as the Russians, who chose to
ignore such obstacles, to inflict considerable casualties.
Significant advances were also made in the field of camouflage and
smoke screen generation, which gave forces higher survivability, and
the possibility of greater tactical surprise.</P>

<P>In the transporting of land forces, the use of aircraft allowed
new concepts of operations to be explored through the use of airborne
forces. We shall consider this further in the next chapter.
Specialist vehicles for amphibious operations were also developed.
The legendary DUKW, a cross between a lorry and a boat, was not a
great technological breakthrough as an amphibious troop carrier. Like
the tank in the previous war, it was the bringing together of mature
technologies in an innovative way. Again it was necessary to convince
a sceptical military establishment of the military effectiveness of
such an obvious and simple idea.</P>

<P>In many cases the application of already mature technologies is a
characteristic of the more successful army equipment improvements.
This may be a reflection of the large quantities of equipment
necessary for any army re-equipment programme, and hence the
attractions of lower unit costs through the use of technologies
already proven in the civil sector.</P>

<P>While the nature of warfare had changed dramatically between the
two world wars, ground forces still found themselves in attrition
battles. Despite the strategic, technological and economic advantages
which the US forces enjoyed over Japan by 1945, they expected losses
numbered in hundreds of thousands in the final operations to defeat
Japan. In the event, the Japanese surrender was brought about by the
strategic use of atomic weapons at Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August
1945. This winning of the land battle by the use of atomic air power
led many to discount the future importance of non-nuclear land
forces.</P>

<P>The early atomic weapons were large, heavy, expensive and scarce.
Their delivery by air drop against major economic targets made the
relevance of the land battle appear much diminished. Two developments
were to change this premature assessment of the future of land
warfare. Firstly, all conflicts since 1945 have been non-nuclear, and
some have required very large ground force involvement. Secondly,
nuclear weapons were not to remain the rare, bulky and impossibly
expensive munitions that they were at first. The advent of
thermonuclear weapons from 1952 onwards led not only to the
possibility of ever more powerful strategic weapons, but also to much
smaller tactical nuclear warheads. Coupled with progress in missile
technology, armies could be equipped with short range nuclear armed
rockets for use against purely military targets. Nuclear weapons
became cheaper and easier to build, and initially the prospect of
such devastating firepower appeared inviting to the armies of the
nuclear states. The threat of a nuclear attack changed the
traditional military virtue of concentration of force into a new
vulnerability. If armies were to be able to survive a nuclear attack,
they must disperse. Thus the possession of army tactical nuclear
systems could force a potential enemy into deploying in a
disadvantageous way without firing a shot.</P>

<P>As nuclear miniaturisation proceeded, nuclear warheads were fitted
in artillery shells. The potential firepower effect of an artillery
barrage was increased by many orders of magnitude. Science had given
armies explosive power beyond all previous experience. It posed the
nuclear armies with considerable problems in preparing for future
wars. If nuclear missiles, mines, and artillery were available to
both sides and were to be used on the battlefield, losses would be
enormous in very short timescales. It was difficult to visualise
armies being able to make cohesive progress in the aftermath of an
exchange of battlefield nuclear weapons. In addition, the strategic
implications of the use of these tactical weapons could not be
forgotten. The high risk of escalation from battlefield nuclear
weapons being used against military targets to strategic nuclear
weapons being used against population centres, meant that even the
lowest yielding tactical nuclear weapon would remain under firm
political control. While science could provide weapons of great power
for the army, the consequences of their use are so great that they
become virtually unusable. This does not discount the role they play
in deterrence, in that they provide a possible link from conventional
conflict to a strategic nuclear exchange. In the conflicts which have
been fought since 1945 around the world, they have had no part to
play.</P>

<P>If the advent of the nuclear weapon has had less effect on armies
than was originally anticipated, how have land forces used nuclear
power technology? We saw in the previous chapter that nuclear power
was an expensive option for navies, and its advantages only
outweighed its cost in the case of the submarine. Heavy, expensive
and in need of highly technical support, nuclear power plants have
found no army vehicle to propel as yet. Indeed, power sources have
changed little from the internal combustion engines developed at the
start of the century. The gas turbine has been incorporated into some
tank drives, but as yet offers no over-riding advantages.</P>

<P>Tanks have been developed in the post-war period to move at higher
speeds, carry greater firepower, have more mobility and improved
armour protection. These aspects of tank design are interdependent,
and many modern changes in design reflect differing judgements on
relative priorities as much as technological breakthroughs. New
materials can offer improved protection without the consequent
increase in weight of additional armour plate. Tank main armament has
also improved in flexibility, rate of fire and accuracy both through
gun design and fire control system development. Nevertheless, just as
the motor car today operates in much the same way as the car of the
1920s, so the tank seems to have long passed the peak in innovative
design. At the end of World War 1 it was a totally new concept which
could break the deadlock of trench warfare. At the start of World War
2, the tank could make rapid advances possible through the use of
imaginative tactics. By the end of that war, it had become a normal
part of an army's inventory, and was no longer the decisive weapon.
Little has happened to the design of tanks in the last 40 years to
make them once again the battle winning weapon system.</P>

<P>Important research in this post-war period has been into ways of
countering the tank. A tank can be destroyed by mines, missiles or
guns. The mines can be laid by the ground forces, fired by artillery,
or dropped from the air. Missiles can be fired from the ground,
launched from aircraft or operated from handheld infantry systems.
The guns can be high velocity mounted on other tanks, specialist air
or surface systems, or handheld recoil-less rifles. The proliferation
of anti-tank munitions of increasing power over a period of 40 years
makes the contribution of the tank in future wars arguable. The land
campaign of the Gulf War lasted for only 100 hours, but in that time
some 8000 Iraqi vehicles( including 1300 tanks) were destroyed. (11).
</P>

<P>The advent of the armed helicopter both as a tank killer, and a
tank replacement is considered in the next chapter, as are the
implications of the helicopter for land force mobility. Infantry
transport has been developed to provide fast armoured personnel
carriers, yet response times for forces have changed little. Armies
need to transport enormous quantities of men and materiel, the bulk
of which must travel on the earth's surface at speeds which reached
their maximum half a century ago. However, the infantryman has gained
many new capabilities over this time. His personal weapon has
improved in rate of fire, portability and accuracy. He can carry his
communication system with him, it is automatically encoded to prevent
interception, and can change frequency automatically to reduce the
effectiveness of electronic counter-measures. Radar allows him to
pinpoint enemy artillery and mortar positions, and to a limited
extent detect enemy ground movements. He can carry potent anti-tank
and air defence weapons. Post-war technology, through reducing the
size of weapon systems, has made the individual soldier a powerful
weapon operator. Just as the torpedo and the missile threaten the
capital ship, so the hand held anti-tank weapon can threaten the
vastly more expensive tank.</P>

<P>In artillery, with the exception of the nuclear shells discussed
earlier, recent advances have been incremental in nature. Fire
control systems have benefited from the development of smaller and
more powerful computers, so that accurate coordinated fire can be
controlled from multiple artillery batteries. Inertial navigation
systems have improved the accuracy of weapon aiming and of fire
correction. The development of ballistic and cruise missiles for
nuclear weapons has led to systems of sufficiently high accuracy for
them to be considered as options for conventional artillery. The
possibilities and the costs of these options will be examined in the
final section of this book. Unguided rockets have reappeared as a
useful addition to an army's firepower, when coupled to modern
surveillance and targeting systems.</P>

<P>For munitions, high explosive remains the major component of
weapon stocks. Shells are custom built to give greater effectiveness
against particular target sets. Chemical weapons were developed
extensively for use in World War 2, but neither side used them. The
nerve agents available today are potentially very effective against
an unprotected enemy, and technology has provided relatively simple
operating systems for such weapons. Protective measures have also
improved very significantly. With so little experience of chemical
warfare, predictions about its impact on future conflicts is liable
to be very speculative. The reluctance of nations to use such weapons
in the past, for fear of retaliation or international criticism, may
mean that they will continue to have little impact on warfare,
provided both sides see it as in their interest to refrain from their
use. They were used during the Iran/Iraq war, with extensive civilian
caualties reported in 1988. It was expected that Iraq would use
chemical and perhaps biological agents during the Gulf War of 1991.
There is some evidence that deterrence operated and these weapons
were not used for fear of nuclear retaliation by the West.</P>

<P>In one respect, it is possible to be confident that technology has
changed the nature of future major conflict. Since war began, land
fighting had been a predominantly daytime activity. Traditionally
attacks are made at dawn, the fighting continues through the day, and
forces regroup and resupply by night. Technology can now give the
soldier (and as importantly the airman) the ability to see at night
virtually as well as by day. Image intensifiers can now be produced
which can be worn with little more incumbrance than spectacles. Night
sights give a true night firing ability. The widespread use of night
vision aids may be one of the most significant products of post-war
technology for land forces. The implications of continuous fighting
for manpower, ammunition consumption, logistic support and
vulnerability of the supply system are profound. Yet again experience
is limited.</P>

<P>The technologies which have most recently provided a new dimension
to land warfare have been in the field of battlefield position
information. The Gulf War was the first opportunity to use handheld
Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers as personal items of kit.
For the first time in the history of warfare an infantryman could
know exactly where he was and where he was going. Couple this with
the advent of aerial surveillance systems (JSTARS) which could see
ground movements on both sides, and the fog of war was significantly
thinned.</P>

<P>Any analysis of what prospects technology holds for the land
forces of tomorrow must make assumptions about the roles of such
forces. The armies of the NAT nations are still largely equipped
around the needs of the Cold War. For example, German forces lack
deployable logistic support because they were structured to defend
their home territory and could rely on the civil infrastructure.
There is still a widespread desire among the armed forces to stay in
the high intensity and large scale warfighting game. The experience
of the Gulf War is used as an argument for this requirement. Others
argue that security needs are changing. In an increasingly
inderpendent world community, large scale war becomes less likely.
Military forces will be needed, but more for reimposing order in
internal disputes. These conflicts make take the form of terrorism as
in Northern Ireland or Israel; or they make be peacekeeping in a
benign environment such as the Golan Heights; or they may be policing
an agreed settlement as in Bosnia in 1995/96 following the Dayton
agreement.</P>

<P>Armies are needed for forms of conflict ranging from internal
disorder, through terrorism and guerilla war, to small and medium
scale international wars. The search must be for equipment and
tactics to fit the land forces for the many roles which they may be
called upon to undertake; and to do it at an affordable price.</P>

<P>This brief review of technological development in land warfare
does not give much cause for optimism for the future. While the
historian's benefit of hindsight is a great help, it does not appear
that armies in peace have been able to spot the technologies which
would give them major advantages in war. There has also been marked
institutional pressures against changing to new tactical concepts to
exploit the potential of new technologies. The lessons have certain
parallels with the naval warfare cases examined in the previous
chapter, in respect of those areas which produced qualitative changes
in effectiveness. Early weapon developments were in rates of fire,
and greater range, hence changing the nature of the battle. Changes
in power sources gave flexibility and range to operations: the
railway and the internal combustion engine revolutionised logistic
support. Mass production brought mass destruction. The telegraph,
telephone and wireless gave instantaneous communication and control,
changing the way land forces could be used. Major weapon systems have
become more vulnerable to much cheaper portable weapons. New
technologies for pinpointing both friendly and enemy forces are
changing the nature of the control of land war.</P>

<P>For the future land forces may be needed for all the roles which
they have had in the past. They will need to enhance their
capabilities in four areas. Firstly they will need timely and
accurate intelligence both at the strategic and tactical level, if
the forces are to be used effectively. Secondly the forces will need
mobility to deploy to theatres of operations, and once there to
fighting positions. Thirdly the soldier's firepower must be developed
to provide the right effect at the minimum cost. Finally, as the
enemy develops his ability to fight the land war, the survivability
of man and machine will be an increasing problem.</P>
