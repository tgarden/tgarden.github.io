<H3><CENTER>The security context and UK present capabilities
</CENTER></H3>

<H3><CENTER><I>Sir Timothy Garden</I></CENTER></H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The first thing to say is that the security challenges are
considerably less worrying than they have been in this century. In
the Cold War there was no difficulty with the NATO mission. A real
threat existed to the UK, and a war could have started at any time.
The forces arrayed between NATO and the Warsaw Pact were real, and
were at a high state of readiness. We shall never, thankfully, know
what the outcome of such war would have been. But there is no doubt
that it would have been awful for Europe and that Britain would have
been fully involved. So, my starting point is that we, in the UK, are
now much safer than we were before, and that as we look forward in
time, it is just as likely that we shall become even safer as it is
likely that new dangers will arise. Indeed all our security efforts
should be directed towards that aim: making the future prospects for
security better.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>So what are the current and future security concerns? The
traditional analysis would first consider direct threats to national
survival. Such threats can still be constructed from the remaining
nuclear arsenals, but seem improbable. In the longer term one can
postulate nuclear-armed hostile states or groups, but there are
actions that can be taken now to reduce risks. These actions are in
the field of arms control, technology transfer, and a host of control
measures. They are not primarily military tasks. The more likely
direct threats are in other non-military fields: environmental,
disease, economic, migration, drugs, corruption. All are security
threats to the state but not ones that call primarily for a military
capability, although the military may be asked to provide help to
other agencies. From a UK perspective, the only remaining military
type threat in the near term is terrorism, and even this is primarily
a police operation.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>But we are told that we must all remember the history of the
inter-war years. The 10 year rule led to a dangerous disarmament of
Britain, which only just re-armed in time to meet the German threat.
Today, lead times for the development and training of military
capability is much longer than it was in the 30s. That logic would
push us along the path of keeping a broad range of capability so that
expertise is retained, and we would have the ability to expand if
necessary. Indeed an element of that thinking underpins our planning
at present.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Our security is forever tied into what happens in the rest of
Europe. We have a quite different Europe from that between the wars.
Both NATO and the EU have played their part in ensuring that war
between member states is unthinkable. That is a big difference from
the inter-war period. They have both been conflict prevention
organisations. That is they have prevented conflict between member
states. As we look to ways to improve our security in the medium to
longer term, it seems to be entirely logical that extending the
boundaries of both the EU and NATO has great attractions. That is not
to say that there are no dangers. The EU enlargement must be handled
in a way that ensures the new countries can cope with the economic
requirements and that the old members will not be impoverished. There
would be a reduction in security if we saw the EU falling apart.
Similarly NATO enlargement is going to be a tricky operation. It
would be tragic, although unlikely, if we were to end up dividing
Europe again; but with care and diplomacy it can be achieved. It will
not be the NATO of the Cold War when the process is underway - nor
should it be. The extension of western values through membership will
bring greater stability and enhance security. All this means that
Russia must be involved in both processes.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>So if the picture seems to be quite bright in Europe (apart from
difficulties in the Balkans) what of further afield? There are
potential hotspots for serious conflicts. Iraq, elsewhere in the
Middle East, the Koreas, the Indian subcontinent, Central Africa,
Taiwan and perhaps others. When we look at these scenarios from a
British perspective, we now almost inevitably imagine ourselves as
part of a larger intervention force - and rather hope that the US
will be there. For most such wars, if they come to that, our
participation and the level of it, will be a matter of choice. We may
have economic or historical interests, but we no longer see ourselves
in the role of Great Power world policeman. We have obligations as a
P5 member, and we have in the past had a policy of wishing to be a
significant player (punching above our weight). In the end the level
of our involvement is a political choice.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Below the level of a shooting war, we have also seen it as part of
our responsibilities to contribute significantly to peacekeeping and
humanitarian aid. There will be no lack of such demands in the
future, but again our commitment will be a question of choice.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In looking at the roles for the military, we should also consider
the public duty aspects of our forces. The Royal Yacht and the RN
College at Greenwich should act as a salutary reminder that the
military also spends money on things the nation cares about, which
are independent of the security rationale. It applies to all 3
Services: the Household Cavalry or the Red Arrows are other examples.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>There is no need to rehearse the UK's military capability in
detail. The Defence White Paper is really quite good these days for
explaining what we have, why we have it and where we think we might
have to use it. Some of us put some considerable effort into trying
to quantify the balance between commitments and capabilities at a
level of detail where the reader can understand the planning process.
The reader would be quite right to criticise the process as
justifying what we have. It does of course look at how we use what we
have and makes the rationale accordingly. For example if we were not
a nuclear power, we would have no Trident submarines, but that would
not show as a lack in the defence white paper, because we would not
show it as a task. Even so, I believe that the discipline of showing
what we have and to what tasks we earmark capabilities against is
important. It allows ministers and subsequently the public to take a
view on whether the balance of effort is right, and whether the cost
is proportionate to the effect.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Having arrived at the question of costs, I would defend the role
of the Treasury. Left to its own devices, with no financial
restraints, the MOD would increase our forces without limit. In the
uncertain world of future security, you can always buy a little more
insurance. The political judgement must be about the balance between
risk and cost.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The result of this has been a radical drawdown from our Cold War
posture through Tom King's Options for Change. The review was done
more quickly than other nations, but that allowed a reasonable time
for implementation. The final drawdowns were expected to be complete
by April 1995. They were manageable in terms of handling manpower -
and retraining people. The rebalancing of the forces, it seems to me,
was rational in the light of the security situation at the time. We
still were worried about a possible resurgent Russia and were
uncertain about how the CEE states would cope. We had not expected
the humanitarian effort in Bosnia.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The second major change, Malcom Rifkind's Front Line First was a
different kind of exercise. Again, I have no argument with the view
that we should look for ways to deliver the best military capability
for the money available. Carrying out an examination of how to reduce
costs while preserving the front line (or in some cases enhancing it)
is laudable. It is also a difficult trick to turn. Certainly, the
absence of a direct threat to the UK opens up opportunities for
moving some support tasks from the Services to industry. This had
been happening to some degree already with increasing amounts of
contractorisation. The Front Line First exercise sought to take this
approach over a broad range of support activities and a large number
of free standing studies were required all at once and in a very
short timescale. There were some good studies and some that were
rather less well thought through. As an aside, one problem, within
the military in general and the MOD in particular, is the rate of
turnover of commanders and senior staff. It is always possible to
suggest bright ideas, reasonably safe in the knowledge that your
successor will have to deliver the goods. The changes that resulted
from Front Line First in effect extended the period of uncertainty,
promotion blockage and potential redundancy for the forces beyond the
April 1995 of Options for Change.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>This all happened at a time of continuous military commitment. The
Gulf War, the continuing operations after the Gulf, UNHCR in Bosnia,
IFOR, SFOR, and Northern Ireland. Some will say that the Forces
cannot be immune from the downsizing world that the rest of the
population is experiencing. The problem is that we are also expecting
a level of commitment and loyalty from our military personnel which
is perhaps not the norm any more in industry. We are getting that
loyalty, but the effects will be seen in reductions in re-engagement,
early retirement and a reduction in the unstructured recruiting that
the military do among their family and friends. This should not
surprise us, neither should a surge in outflow at the end of a series
of redundancy schemes. There is no better retention incentive than
the rumour of redundancy - everyone waits to see if they can leave on
more attractive terms. Manning the armed forces may well be a future
constraint every bit as important as how much money is allocated.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>There is one other increasing problem for recruitment and
retention. It is the growing difference between society's values and
norms, and those that we have traditionally viewed as important in
the Services. The more visible tip of this iceberg is in the pregnant
servicewomen, the discharge of homosexuals, racism, bullying and now
the courts-martial rulings that the MOD finds itself having to deal
with. Less obvious is the move away from the nuclear family on the
one hand and the expectation that partners should have an equal right
to consideration of career ambitions on the other. Deference can no
longer be assumed in society. Hierarchical organisations are no
longer considered essential. The division into officers and other
ranks sits ill with the classless society. Society moves towards
assumptions based on the individual good rather than the collective
good of the regiment. All this suggests that he current assumptions
of military culture are also approaching a crisis point.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>What are the issues that the next government should address when
looking at defence? If we assume that the resources will be no
greater in real terms, and pressures will exist for them to reduce,
what should be done?</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>We could continue keeping fingers crossed, deferring equipment as
it proves unaffordable and trying to keep a finger in every pie,
while having undermanned forces operating at permanent overstretch.
We could decide to concentrate on the essential security tasks and
some of those current tasks that our international position makes us
feel we should. We would assume that the threat of a high intensity
conflict had receded into the distant future, and that anyway the US
will probably look after us. This would mean greater focus on
infantry, less on armour for the army. More on transport and
reconnaissance for the air force, some on air defence but less on
offensive air. It would mean less on anti-submarine warfare and
amphibiosity for the navy.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>An alternative approach might be to try to find some better
arrangement of sharing roles with our European allies - but that
would require rather more enthusiasm for a common foreign and
security policy than has been evident so far. It would also require a
degree of confidence that Allies would act together.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>On top of all this there is of course an industrial dimension,
which this paper does not address. The move towards a more
gendarmarie type force, tailored to the tasks of today, would have
few attractions for British Defence Industry. Getting the balance
right in this aspect adds another complication which may not always
give the military quite what they hoped for.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In summary, whatever the composition of the next Government, the
Defence Secretary faces a difficult problem. In some ways, it is more
difficult now with so few certainties to plan against. While
resources may remain around current levels, we already have forces
undermanned in some areas, suffering from the bruising process of two
recent downsizing exercises, and a forward equipment programme which
looks to be potentially over ambitious. It will be a difficult
judgement to make as to whether this is the time to focus investment
on current more limited activities, or continue to try and play in
the big league as an insurance against an uncertain future - and all
this must be done against a background of industrial expectations.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The only option, apart from increased defence expenditure, which
offers the hope of squaring the circle, is a more active attempt to
co-ordinate the capabilities among the members of NATO. In the longer
term, one could hope for this process to extend to a European
approach to Defence.</P>
