<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Introduction</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"> Our security throughout Europe in the
traditional sense is now greater than at any time this century. I am
struck by how much this is accepted by European citizens, whereas
there seems to be a quite different feeling in the United States,
where security threats are seen as increasing. Of course security is
a much wider issue than just assessment of threats to territory,we
may feel increasing concerns about environmental problems or crime or
disease, but my focus will be on the traditional foreign policy
security concerns. We continue to provide money, people and equipment
for our armed forces, and we do that for a number of reasons.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">I do not need to explore fictional scenarios
of future threats to Europe to justify our military provisions. The
evidence of need in the post Cold War world is already with us. NATO
has moved with surprising speed to readjust to the new realities. Its
contribution through the various partnership activities, through
enlargement, the new strategic concept and the operation in Kosovo
have all demonstrated that it has a continuing important role  in
extending peace and security. Yet to many, both inside and outside of
Europe, it is seen as an increasingly unbalanced Alliance. The US
preeminence in capability causes a number of tensions about
burden-sharing, decision-making and influence.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In  looking at how Europe is moving towards
developing its own regional view of security, and providing the
capabilities to underpin  those foreign policy drivers, I have no
doubt that NATO remains the key institution within which the European
members will need to operate for the majority of their security
needs. The problems ahead include developing working mechanisms to
achieve a common EU view on foreign and security policy issues, and
producing some real diplomatic and military capability to underpin
the policy. Both of these aspects are difficult for the EU. We also
have changes since the end of the Cold War, which have left Europe
with its forces wrongly structured for the new doctrine and new
challenges.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Europe seems suddenly to have accelerated in
its pursuit of a more coherent approach to the requirement for a
common  foreign and security policy. The UK change in position has
much to do with this. </FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Lessons of the 90's</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"> 	The end of the Cold War  left  Europe 
with a vast and expensive set of military forces, which had been
practising to fight a single campaign for over 40 years. For Western
Europe, the planning assumptions for an all out war in Europe were
relatively simple. The enemy was well defined and consisted of the
aggregate forces of the  Warsaw Pact. The exact locations, strengths
of forces, tactics to be used and phases of the war were studied by
generations of soldiers. The fall of the Berlin Wall, the unification
of Germany, the demise of the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union, all
changed the strategic landscape in Europe in little more than a 3
year period. The decade of the 90's has seen more diverse military
action by the Western nations, under various banners, than at any
time previously.  Kuwait, Iraq, Somalia, Rwanda, Bosnia, Haiti,
Albania, Kosovo and now East Timor have seen western military force
deployed to less than benign environments. A new doctrine for peace
support operations has replaced the manuals on flexible response in
the military staff colleges of the Alliance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	This series of military and diplomatic
adventures is sufficient now to have established a strong consensus
on the new rationale for NATO, which was articulated in the Strategic
Concept launched at the NATO summit in Washington in April 1999. The
ever increasing data from real operations, rather than deterrence
postures, has also highlighted the major shortcomings in the security
capabilities available to the Alliance for these new tasks. The Gulf
War, while not a NATO operation, was conducted by an ad hoc coalition
drawn for the most part from NATO members. It was conducted using
NATO procedures with forces drawn from NATO formations.  It was a
relatively clear cut case for the international community to react to
aggression, and thus an almost ideal trial for the concept of
enforcing international law. Iraq had clearly broken international
law by invading Kuwait, and the UN could authorise military action to
expel the invaders. Iraq had few friends among its neighbours; had an
oppressive regime with potentially dissident  groups; and  was 
remote to US and European publics. The US led coalition was able to
take its time in building up military presence in the surrounding
area. The then novel doctrine of a prolonged air campaign was tested
successfully.  Lack of casualties to the allies made the 6 weeks of
offensive air action acceptable to politicians and public.  The much
greater availability of precision guidance for bombs had also set a
precedent in terms of what was acceptable collateral damage in this
type of operation. The 4 days of ground war reinforced this new
vision of  war: ground forces sent in only when it was safe to secure
the victory that had been won  relatively bloodlessly from the air.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The key lesson from the Gulf  War was that
the US was both quantitatively and qualitatively in a different 
capability league from all the other nations involved.  Somalia
reinforced the perception internationally that the US was only
prepared to remain engaged if their troops were kept safe. The
predominance of airpower solutions to international crises was
underlined by the continuing air operations over both Northern and
Southern Iraq. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The sequence of events in Bosnia
reinforced within the US the view that offensive airpower could
provide the necessary coercion to bring recalcitrant leaders to the
negotiating table. That the history of the region up to the Dayton
accord is considerably more complex is unimportant. There is a
widespread perception among  American decision makers that the threat
and application of air strikes was critical to obtaining Milosevic's
agreement to the Dayton proposals. Again, in this short air campaign,
the world expected precision attacks with no collateral damage and no
losses to our own side. When an airman was lost over hostile
territory, combat search and rescue effort became the over-riding
priority. There were less intense military adventures. Operation
Alba, the response to the breakdown of law and order in Albania,
showed that there were crises which required a European coalition of
the willing response. In this case, it was clear that the mechanisms
for putting together such a coalition were imperfect, and that it was
only possible because of  the relatively benign environment.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The 1999 Kosovo air campaign brought
together all the political and military lessons that had been learned
in the post Cold War operations. The contributions from the European 
NATO nations which took part were varied, but all were overshadowed
by the US. Europe was shown to be good at providing political support
for the operation, but incompetent at contributing to the air
campaign in a significant way. The difficulties in raising ground
force numbers, even for an operation in a relatively  benign
environment, suggested that the armies of  Europe were as badly
structured as those of the air forces. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Europe as a Strategic Power	</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Does any of this matter? It is sometimes
argued that there is no need to change the current arrangements for
security within Europe. NATO served the continent well throughout the
Cold War, and has reinvented itself to adapt to the security needs of
the post Cold War era. Indeed the enlargement of NATO, the new
strategic concept and the recognition of the needs of a European
Defence and Security Identity within NATO are all a part of a new
security structure for Europe. The question is whether this process
of development within the NATO structure is sufficient for the
future. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Europe is an economic power, but it is a
long way from being a strategic power.  For the 21st Century, it
seems inconceivable that a region which is as rich and populous as
the United States can expect to continue its foreign and security
policy on either an exclusively  national basis or only through NATO.
As we have seen from Bosnia and Kosovo, Europe must shape its
security strategy  always mindful of how it will play in the US
Congress. Looking to the longer term, NATO remains important (and
more secure after Kosovo), but there is no guarantee that it will
remain in existence for ever. Had the Kosovo operation ended in
failure, the future utility of NATO would have been very much in
doubt. There will doubtless be other tests of Alliance cohesion in
the years ahead.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Improving  European Capability</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The question  is how  to develop a
European Foreign and Security Policy which is underpinned by the
necessary diplomatic and military capability to implement it. We need
a design which maintains and supports NATO but gives us a European
capability to protect and promote European vital interests. The
arguments too often revolve around the institutional debates. The
linkages between NATO, WEU, and the EU, coupled with debates over
second and fourth pillars, do little to advance the military
capability available to Europe. The institutional framework is very
important but it is nothing without the military and diplomatic
capability to underpin it. Too often the institutional debate
revolves around how to give Europe a greater voice in the deployment
of US assets. What needs to be addressed is how to provide more
European useful capability, and then how it should be organised in
both a NATO and an EU context.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">		The EU and the US have GDPs of almost
exactly the same size. Yet EU nations spend only just over half as
much on defence, and then share these smaller resources over twice as
many troops.   Hopes for fixing the problems of European defence
capability currently centre on each nation modernising their military
on a national basis. Each nation is expected to transform its forces
into rapidly deployable smaller more flexible units tailored to peace
enforcement. These forces would then be identified by the process
that stems from the Helsinki summit last year. While this would
certainly offer some extra resources for the types of operation which
are currently being undertaken, it would not greatly improve the
total defence capability that Europe obtains for its vast expenditure
of defence.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Ideally the development of the common
defence policy for the European Union, like the United Kingdom's
recent strategic defence review, should be foreign policy led. The
scale and the scope of the armed forces would be determined by the
objectives of foreign policy developed within the CFSP, while
ensuring that  members of the North Atlantic Alliance could meet
their NATO obligations.  The arrival of former Secretary General of
NATO, Javier Solana, as the High Representative for Foreign and
Security Policy in the EU  ought to make this easier.This would not
lead to any decoupling of European countries from their NATO
undertakings.  Nor should there be any duplication of the critical
contribution to military co-operation provided by NATO, namely its
command structures and headquarters, although certain developments of
double-hatting could take place.  The most effective way for the
members of the European Union to get more deployable forces for a
euro is by systematically developing economies of scales in the
support, training and operational management of their armed forces.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">On the political side progress has been
made, particularly through the changes in the UK stance since St Malo
in December 1998 and the work done subsequently culminating in
Helsinki in December 1999. Unfortunately, the politicians have gone
for the big ticket item of a deployable European force of 60,000
which can be sustained for 12 months with air and naval support. This
is unlikely to make any great improvement to the total of European
military effectiveness, and will certainly give many nations an
excuse to reduce their capability yet further.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Current Examples of Integration</FONT>
</H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	There are two approaches whereby
duplication between European armed forces could be eliminated  and
additional resources  made available for increased force
effectiveness.  One would be in the development of new common
capabilities, and the other is the development of pooled support and
logistic services.  An existing Alliance example of the first
approach is the common procurement and operation by fourteen allies
of the AWACS (airborne early warning and control) aircraft.  An
example of the second approach is the way that four Nordic countries
providing troops to IFOR/SFOR are supported by a common logistic
battalion.  The agreement by the Netherlands and Belgian navies to
develop common headquarters and support services for their fleets is
a hopeful sign that some European states have made a start to the
elimination of expensive duplication. Already this approach is
allowing greater military capability to be deployed. While the Dutch
and the Belgian planners would individually be reluctant to offer an
unlimited deployment of a frigate for operations, they can now
arrange to share a task with a roulement of forces between
themselves. The management of the force from a shared headquarters
results in a greater military capability at no extra cost.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The inefficiencies of the national
approach to defence within European states is widely recognised. Some
argue that the most effective way to tackle it is through common
procurement and perhaps greater integration of European defence
industries. Attempts at both elements have not always been successful
in the past. Recent experience in procurement of an Anglo-French
frigate shows how difficult it is to see such projects through
successfully. Moreover, the defence industries are reluctant to be
integrated by European fiat. They look to partnerships which improve
their shareholder value. This may in any case be a better approach as
it is likely to improve competition and hence value for money.
Nevertheless, there will be opportunities for sensible common
procurement where there is a widely shared common requirement, and it
makes sense to try to exploit these where it can reduce procurement
costs.  These opportunities will arise more often if nations move
towards a pooling of  military resources.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Early Opportunities for Initiatives</FONT>
</H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	An immediate opportunity to explore common
procurement is the Medium Scale Transport Aircraft, for which common
tenders are being sought by seven European countries. There is also a
need for large strategic air lift capability which could be
approached jointly. These are two examples where after common
procurement, common operation could be considered. Germany seems to
be enthusiastic for such an approach at Government level, although
little real progress is being made. If operated as a European force,
a reduction in the number of  main operating bases required would
lead to much greater cost effectiveness.  These could become early
examples of European Force Elements.  The development of a common
European flight refuelling service could also be examined. This might
be made easier if it were done on a commercial basis as is currently
the plan for the UK.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Eurofighter, already ordered by five
countries, could provide a trial for a number of these concepts.  If
Europe moved towards the American large airbase concept, we might
perhaps  imagine an operationally ready force of some 400
Eurofighters made up of 20 multinational squadrons distributed over
as few as five airbases.  In addition an operational training base on
a sixth airfield would be required.  The training base could also
provide a home for the European Union Eurofighter HQ. The operating
costs would be much less than the planned national arrangements, even
if the traditionally smaller European airbases were retained.   The
key to success would be the application of common training,
procedures and aircraft modification programmes.  By making each unit
truly multinational and by developing the overall common operational
policy through the EU HQ, the problems of  national divergence could
be eliminated.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	In the marine environment, one can
cumulate existing capacities and provide common supply services,
possibly leading to a rationalisation of the number of European naval
bases.  Fleet auxiliaries can be envisaged as developing a common
European service.  An early candidate as one of the European Force
Elements, would be a European mine counter measure service. The
principle could be applied to larger ships.  France, Italy, Spain and
the United Kingdom all wish to have some aircraft carrier capability;
could it be provided by a common squadron thereby providing savings
in support and logistic chains, while also ensuring that a viable
force was available at all times?  A European led Combined Joint Task
Force in the maritime environment at present lacks a satisfactory
headquarters ship; one, or more, of these could be acquired on a
common basis.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	It would make sense to begin the approach
to land forces by looking at engineers, communications, transport and
medical services, which could provide the first common programmes. 
The wider field of logistic support could follow and an early
candidate would be the development of common IT systems for
logistics.  The question of outsourcing logistic and support services
is now under active consideration in a number of European countries. 
There would be economies through the  working out of common
specifications and the use of a limited number of common suppliers. 
Success in these areas would enable a subsequent application of the
approach of European Force Elements to artillery, armour and infantry
units.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	There are some force elements which are
provided jointly to&nbsp;all armed services.  Some of these, like
protection against nuclear, biological and chemical warfare, are
obvious candidates for common provision.  Others, such as
intelligence and mapping, are more difficult because of traditional
transatlantic patterns of co-operation, but it would be a mistake for
the development of a separable NATO for any capability to depend on a
single ally, even the United States.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The money thrown up by such
rationalisations could be used for those essential capabilities
identified at Helsinki such as intelligence, strategic lift, and
Command &amp; control structure.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Need for a European Defence
Budget</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	These examples suggest some practical
areas where the development of European Force Elements and common
support and logistic services could provide building blocks for the
strengthening of European defence capabilities. They would make more
effective use of European defence budgets through the removal of the
cost overhang of separate support systems. Valuable as such
individual initiatives would be, they would not by themselves
represent a coherent new security structure for  Europe. They would
however illustrate how significant improvements in effectiveness
could be achieved through merging particular national capabilities
and sharing common services.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	For this approach to become coherent, it
would be necessary to develop a planning and budgetary system at the
European level. The ultimate requirement would be for a European
Defence Budget. Under such a system EU members would provide either
defence capability or money as their contribution. This would have a
number of beneficial effects: not only would the free ride be
stopped, but nations would probably prefer to improve their military
capabilities rather than to contribute money to the employment and
industries of other nations. A virtuous circle of improved military
capability and effective European defence could be established. There
would be many problems in assessing the true worth of each
contribution, but the process would also make the planning and audit
at the European level more effective.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Reality or Fantasy?</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">While I can construct ways forward that
would give Europe much better capability for its defence spending,
the reality is likely to be much less exciting. For rationalisation
or pooling of capability to work, headquarters and bases must be
closed, senior staff officers pensioned off, and cozy organisations
dismembered. This results in enormous institutional antipathy to such
moves. The questions, which seem to me to be fairly spurious, about
sovereignty implications give another excuse for little to be done.
Pork barrel politics ensure that equipment spending remains
sub-optimal. It is a measure of how far Europe is from doing anything
significant that we all believe the Helsinki goals will be difficult.
A region that spends 170 Bn Euros on defence, has 2 million men in
uniform, must struggle to provide a 15 brigade deployable force. 
Those who advocate more spending by Europe on defence are even less
likely to have their hopes realised. In any event a Europe that
spends so ineffectively on defence would not be helped by just
wasting more money.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">There is a real danger that the Helsinki
goals will be used as an excuse by nations to do even less. ESDI will
founder, like so many of the previous initiatives, and NATO will be
weakened as a result.</FONT></P>
