			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>Announcements about troop moves came at an increasing pace in the months leading up to hostilities. The UK had particular political sensitivities about appearing to make military deployments, which might compromise diplomatic options. In a succession of announcements starting in December 2002, the Defence Secretary, Geoff Hoon announced precautionary measures including booking sea transport and warning reservists, followed by deployment of advance parties, reserve call-ups, and the deployment of naval forces, and finally ground and air units. In the US, the build up of forces continued in parallel. There were continuing air operations over the two No Fly Zones. These had seen an increased use of offensive munitions by the US and UK since the middle of 2002. The targets that were attacked remained for the most part air defence related. But what was the condition of Iraqi forces waiting for the coalition forces as they prepared in Kuwait?</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h4><b>Iraqi Forces</b></h4>
			<h3>Force Structure</h3>
			<p>At the beginning of the war, Iraqi forces numbered about 375,000, including 80,000 Republican Guard and 20-25,000 Special Republican Guard (in Baghdad), plus 650,000 reservists. Iraq&rsquo;s major, serviceable equipments included 1,500 main battle tanks (T55s and T72s), 2,000 armoured personnel carriers (various), 2,250 artillery pieces, about 100 missiles of relatively short range (Frog, Scud, Al-Samoud), 100 attack helicopters and some 300 aircraft, both fighters and ground attack. Most equipments were a generation old, of dubious serviceability and no match for US and UK capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp; Iraq&rsquo;s regular army consisted of 16 divisions, of which six were armoured or mechanised and distributed about the country<a title="" name="_ftnref1" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>. These divisions did not materialise as formed units, though some individuals may have fought with the militia and Fedayeen. It was rumoured that the 1st and 5<sup>th</sup> Iraqi army corps had been intended to defend the strategically important cities of Mosul and Kirkuk.&nbsp; The Republican Guard of 80,000 soldiers consisted of three armoured, one mechanised and two infantry divisions, the best known of which were theNebuchadnezzar, Hammurabi, and Medina divisions.. Since 1998, the Republican Guard had been placed under the direct command of the presidential palace and Saddam&rsquo;s son Qusay, rather than the Defence Ministry; reflecting its principal role hitherto as an instrument of internal repression. The military commander was General Ibrahim Abdal Satter Mohammad al Tikriti, one of Saddam&rsquo;s inner circle from his hometown of Tikrit. Many officers came from Tikrit and were mostly Sunni Muslims but not all. Certainly by the standards of the Iraqi army, the Republican Guard was an elite. Its men were not conscripts, were better trained, better-paid, lived in better quarters and were better disciplined than the regular army. The average guard earned 11,000 dinars per month &#150; 4,000 more than a conscript. However, even as a special force they were not completely trusted by Saddam. The Siriya, was a small enforcement squad created by Saddam to be positioned behind the guards to make sure they did not run away.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The initial deployment of the Republican Guard saw three armoured divisions &#150; the Medina, Hammurabi and Nida &#150; placed south of Baghdad at Karbala. Each comprised about 10,000 soldiers, 150-200 tanks, about 250 armoured personnel carriers and 50-60 artillery pieces. Of the two infantry divisions, the Baghdad division was deployed at al-Kut, 100 miles southeast of Baghdad, with the Nebuchadnezzar division originally dispersed around Kirkuk and Mosul in Northern Iraq, but then redeployed to reinforce the Medina Division in the Karbala gap. The sole mechanised division, the Adnan division, had some tanks but was mainly equipped with armoured personnel carriers and was based around Tikrit<a title="" name="_ftnref2" href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The Special Republican Guard of 20-25,000 men consisted of four brigades and 14 battalions. It was a commando force armed mostly with light and medium weapons, but it also has two tank battalions, three artillery batteries and three air defence batteries. Its main job was to oversee the loyalty of the Republican Guard and to maintain Saddam&rsquo;s grip on the regime and Baghdad. They were reportedly trained in house-to-house fighting, with the task of inflicting losses that coalition commanders would find unacceptable.&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the Special Security Organisation consisted of several hundred officers who coordinated the close protection of Saddam and his family and various militia groups or Fedayeen. They also dealt with dissidents. Under the command of Saddam&rsquo;s younger son Qusay and General Abed al-Hamid, the Special Security Organisation was closely linked to the Ba&rsquo;ath party, its militia and Fedayeen. The strength and degree of control exercised by the Special Security Organisation over the people of Iraq appears to have been badly under-estimated by coalition commanders. While this was not significant at the operational level, it did cause a number of tactical reverses when cities such as Basra did not immediately reject the Saddam regime in favour of the coalition.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Shortly before the invasion, Saddam seems to have ordered his commanders to reorganise Iraq into four military regions: northern, Baghdad, central and southern. Saddam&rsquo;s younger son and heir apparent Qusay and General Mizban Khadr Hadi were given command of the central region. The elder son Uday was given command of the internal security forces and along with his brother Qusay, the responsibility for the defence of Baghdad. Southern region including the city of Basra, from which direction the invasion was expected to come was given to Saddam&rsquo;s cousin, General Ali Hassan al-Majid, often known as &lsquo;Chemical Ali&rsquo;. General Izzat Ibrahim Douri was given command of the northern region. Both al-Majid and Douri were wanted for war crimes against the Kurds in the north, the Marsh Arabs in the south and for the invasion of Kuwait in 1990.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>Equipment</h3>
			<p>Before the conflict Iraqi forces were of significant size, and were described as &lsquo;the most effective military power in the Gulf.&rsquo;<a title="" name="_ftnref3" href="#_ftn3">[3]</a>&nbsp; But their equipment had been degraded by the years of sanctions. Although the Iraqi air force might have had 300 combat aircraft, it was not believed to have any effective combat capability against modern air forces. Of greater concern were the ground-based air defence systems with 850 missile launchers and 3000 anti-aircraft gun systems. The Iraqi navy had only nine small combat ships with an offensive mining capability. Chemical munitions were expected to be available to defending forces.<a title="" name="_ftnref4" href="#_ftn4">[4]</a> There was also a capability to mobilise significantly larger numbers. The reserve pool of 650,000 could theoretically have been supplemented from 3.4 million men of military service age.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>Tactics</h3>
			<p>The use of paramilitary forces (Saddam&rsquo;s Fedayeen) in concert with civilian security and intelligence services resulted in a stiffer defensive force in the Shia southern area of the country that might have been expected. The defensive layers of Republican Guard divisions around Baghdad proved less resilient, and the expected hard resistance from elite units in the capital and in Tikrit never materialised. Although major routes to Bagdhad were mined at river crossings, no bridge was demolished by retreating Iraqi forces. This appears to have been a result of the destruction of command and control systems by coalition air power, and very rapid advances by US ground forces. The lack of any ability to operate in the air was a major drawback for Iraqi forces.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Five days after the war had started US General Wesley Clarke summed up Iraqi tactics in the following way: Saddam has shored up weak units with Republican Guard detachments and Fedayeen. Some soldiers are hidden amongst the civilian population and using women and children as human shields. The Iraqis&rsquo; advantages are knowledge of the terrain, willingness to take losses and their ability to blend with the population. They will have almost all the weapons they need to fight on an almost equal basis if they can close in on Coalition forces. They will use smoke and oil fires to obscure visibility and counter coalition air power. Their tanks, while no match for M1A1 Abrams or Challenger are still formidable against troops and light vehicles. Their rocket-propelled grenades will penetrate light armoured vehicles. Their heavy machine guns are effective against helicopters and low flying aircraft. Their small arms arm are accurate and lay down a heavy rate of fire. The Iraqis will want to fight close and dirty, with Iraqi tanks darting in and out of garages and buildings; they will conduct small-scale offensive actions with dismounted soldiers supported by mortars. The fighting will be full of tricks we have already seen and more: ambushes, fake surrenders, soldiers dressed as women, attacks on rear areas and command posts. The Iraqis will be prepared to conduct high-risk missions of a kind we would not consider.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>While generally over estimating Iraqi capabilities, this proved nevertheless to be a reasonable prediction of Iraqi tactics. That said, the bulk of Iraq&rsquo;s regular army appears to have decided to avoid battle, rather than confront the well-armed coalition.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Iraq&rsquo;s regular army divisions simply left the battlefield,&nbsp; the Republican Guard divisions eventually made a stand, of sorts, outside Baghdad.&nbsp; But this resistance was soon worn down by coalition air power and defeated in detail by ground forces. The much-vaunted Special Republican Guard, kike the regular army divisions, offered little substantial resistance.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h4>Coalition Forces</h4>
			<h3>Operations in the North</h3>
			<p>On March 2<sup>nd</sup>, the Turkish government postponed indefinitely a new vote on accepting 62,000 US troops after Parliament&rsquo;s refusal to endorse the planned deployment . This surprise decision made planning &ldquo;more complicated&rdquo;, in the words of Ari Fleischer the White House spokesman.&nbsp; [Source for the Fleischer quote??] <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>By March 5<sup>th</sup> no final decision had been made by the Turkish government.&nbsp; US Central Command (CENTCOM) was still hoping to use Turkish bases but time was short and General Franks had to decide whether or not to reroute the 24 ships carrying the 4<sup>th</sup> Mechanised Infantry Division&rsquo;s heavy equipment south to Kuwait through the Suez canal &#150; a journey of seven to ten days. Whatever the final plan, the 15 Iraqi divisions, reportedly stationed in the north around the strategic cities of Mosul, Kirkukk and Tikrit, would need to be engaged, fixed and destroyed, and the Kirkukk oil fields seized before they could be set on fire.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The US inability to persuade Turkey to allow its bases to be used for an attack on Iraq and to open a northern front complicated CENTCOM&rsquo;s plans . The objectives of the northern advance were to take Mosul, Kirkuk and its oil-fields, and Tikrit, and open the way to Baghdad. The capture of Mosul would have been a serious blow to the Iraqi government because it was the home of many senior army officers and officials. Kirkuk was, if anything considered even more essential. The province of Kirkuk is a major producer of oil, and securing Kirkuk swiftly was also considered important by policy makers because of its value to the Kurds . Military planners feared if the attack was delayed, Saddam might use the time to blow up the oil-fields as he did in Kuwait in 1991. Thus, with the closing of the northern option for 4<sup>th</sup> Mechanised Infantry Division, the coalition had about 62,000 troops and 310 military aircraft in the wrong place.<b></b></p>
			<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
			<p>With Turkey unavailable as a base, the northern option was limited to the deployment of air assault and Special Forces. Parachute and air assault forces could be inserted from the US 101<sup>st</sup> and 82<sup>nd</sup> Airborne Divisions and the UK&rsquo;s 16 Air Assault Brigade, with objectives limited to seizing key airfields at Dohuk, Arbil and Sulaimaniya, and oil fields. These forces were not, however, considered sufficiently &lsquo;heavy&rsquo; to fix and destroy the 12 Iraqi divisions reputed to be in the north. The US giant C17 Globemaster aircraft could be used to move battle tanks to the north, but only one at a time. It was always intended that air assault forces and Special Forces would be used to fight alongside Kurdish forces but the fighting capacity of the Kurdish forces was, at the time, untested. In the end, Kurdish forces and Special Forces teams fought extremely successfully and went some way to off-setting the absence of the 4<sup>th</sup> Mechanised Infantry Division.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>Kurdish Forces</h3>
			<p>At the start of the war, the two western provinces of Iraqi Kurdistan, Dohuk and Arbil were ruled by the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) led by Masoud Barzani. He claimed to have an army of 62,000, of whom 50,000 were combat troops, mainly infantry but with a few tanks and artillery pieces. They were originally a guerrilla force but had been upgrading into a more professional force. Many Kurdish officers who had served in the Iraqi army occupied senior positions in both Kurdish armies. In addition to the KDP forces, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, was in control of Sulaimaniyah province in eastern Kurdistan. It claimed to have an army of about 40,000 men. The two parties, who had fought savage civil wars in the 1990s, had only recently established a joint military command. Both armies and the joint command had been receiving training support and specialist equipment from US Special Forces and CIA training teams from 1992 onwards. These teams remained &lsquo;embedded&rsquo; when hostilities broke out to perform liaison duties but more importantly to coordinate coalition air support.<b></b></p>
			<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
			<h3>Calendar of the Campaign</h3>
			<p>The first shots of the war were fired on Tuesday 18th March in the mouth of the River Khawr al-Zubayr south of the port of Umm Qasr, when a Kuwaiti gunboat challenged a flotilla of about 25 Iraqi dhows. The boats, suspected of laying mines, failed to respond when challenged.&nbsp; Hostilities proper began in the early hours of 20th March 2003, with the launch of a limited missile strike against targets close to Baghdad. Some 36 Tomahawk cruise missiles were launched from US ships in the Gulf and the Red Sea, against a building in which the Iraqi leadership was believed to be meeting<a title="" name="_ftnref5" href="#_ftn5">[5]</a>. The missile attack was followed up by air delivered precision-guided bombs. The White House acknowledged that the start of the campaign had been initiated ahead of the main plan after intelligence information offered the possibility of a decapitation strike against the Iraqi regime.<a title="" name="_ftnref6" href="#_ftn6">[6]</a> In retaliation, Iraq fired three unsuccessful surface-to-surface missiles at Kuwait. One missile was launched at Kuwait City but was intercepted and destroyed, with two Chinese made Seersucker anti-ship missiles landing in the desert without causing any casualties.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The main<i> </i>campaign began the following day with intense air attacks by cruise missiles and precision guided bombs on key military and government targets in Baghdad and other regional centres. Simultaneously, advance elements of the 3<sup>rd</sup> (US) Mechanised Infantry Division pushed into Iraq towards Nasiriya, while the 1<sup>st</sup> (UK) Armoured Division and US Marines advanced towards Basra, and the oil terminal at Umm Qasr. Other air assault and Special Forces were tasked to seize and hold key strategic oil-wells and airfields in the west.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>The First Week: 20-27 March</h3>
			<p>By nightfall on the first day of the war, coalition aircraft had flown over 1,200 sorties and 55 Tomahawk cruise missiles had been fired. There had been three unsuccessful Iraqi missile firings and an early exchange of artillery fire . At 5pm the main coalition fire-plan commenced and pounded the closest Iraqi positions. At 7pm marines launched their main offensives against al-Faw Peninsula and Umm Qasr, flying in from HMS <i>Ocean</i> and HMS <i>Ark Royal.&nbsp; </i>At the same time, other marine units formed a blocking position to the north of al-Faw and seized a number of oil installations. The remainder of the 1<sup>st</sup> Armoured Division moved north to block any Iraqi counter-moves and to shield the right flank of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Mechanised Infantry Division and the remainder of the US Marine Expeditionary Force as they pushed north.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Throughout Day 2 fighting continued as 7<sup>th</sup> Armoured Brigade (the &lsquo;Desert Rats&rsquo;) advanced north to Basra, and the US 3<sup>rd</sup> Mechanised Infantry Division advanced north towards Nasiriya. In the south, the main fighting continued in and around the al-Faw peninsula and the harbour facilities at Umm Qasr. In the west, two Iraqi strategic airfields known as H2 and H3 were seized by Special Forces deploying from Jordan in Chinook helicopters. Both airfields had been used in the past to store weapons of mass destruction (WMD). Seizing the air bases was also believed to be vital to prevent Saddam launching Scud missile attacks against Israel from the western Iraqi desert. Elements of the Royal Engineers, explosive ordnance clearance teams, and nuclear, chemical and biological teams and US combat forces seized and started to clear oil-fields to the south and east of Basra. Seven oil wells had been set alight by Iraqi forces but they were quickly extinguished .</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>US forces from the 3<sup>rd</sup> Mechanised Infantry Division, led by troops from 7<sup>th</sup> Cavalry Regiment continued to advance rapidly towards Baghdad and within 48 hours had moved about 100 miles to Nasiriyah and the vital bridges on the River Euphrates. This advance constituted a15 mile long armoured column led by Apache attack helicopters with forward intelligence provided by JSTAR (joint surveillance and target attack radar system) aircraft and Predator unmanned air vehicles (UAV). The Pentagon claimed an Iraqi brigade of 8,000 troops had surrendered to coalition forces near Basra. In Umm Qasr, the strategic old port fell, although isolated pockets of resistance remained. These were finally cleared on 24<sup>th</sup> March, after a three-day joint air land operation.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>By 24<sup>th</sup> March, just four days after the invasion had begun, Nasiriyah had been bypassed and the 3<sup>rd</sup> Mechanised Infantry Division had pushed on to Najaf, 100 miles south of Baghdad.&nbsp; International media were beginning to question the success of the coalition forces,<a title="" name="_ftnref7" href="#_ftn7">[7]</a> even though coalition forces had at this stage advanced approximately 150 miles into Iraq at the expense of 12 soldiers killed in combat, 19 killed in accidents and a further 2 deaths attributed to friendly fire. Umm Qasr had been declared safe and open, and US marines had captured the bridges over the Euphrates in Nasiriyah to open another approach to Baghdad. Though isolated hit and run and mortar attacks against US marines and coalition forces continued from the suburbs of the city for more several days, these were not of operational significance. Capturing the bridges over the Euphrates opened up two separate approaches to Baghdad, one to be exploited by the 3<sup>rd</sup> Mechanised Infantry Division in the west through Najaf to Karbala, and the other to the east by the 1<sup>st</sup> Marine Expeditionary Force (1 MEF).</p>
			<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
			<p>The 26 and 27 March saw inclement weather and sandstorms, slowing the allied advance short of the main Republican Guard defences around Baghdad . Air strikes continued, nevertheless, particularly against Republican Guard divisions surrounding Baghdad which were expected to be more difficult to break through than the defences in the south. Some elements of Iraqi forces to the north of Baghdad were deployed to reinforce the southern defences. At this stage, it appears that the Iraq military command was functioning well enough to re-deploy forces at divisional level. However, air attacks on communications centres during this period may have been successful in breaking links between the military leadership and its troops.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>It was during this period that the Republican Guard attempted a series of counter moves, under cover of sand storms, against the 7<sup>th</sup> Cavalry Regiment and other units of the US 5th Corps, and the 1 MEF as they advanced north towards Baghdad. Two columns each of up to 1,000 vehicles including T72s counter-attacked at Najafand at Kut. These may have been designated reserve forces from the Republican Guard forces. It is more likely, however, that they were an ad hoc force cobbled together at short notice and under extreme pressure from air attack. Presumably, the decision to counter-attack was taken under the mistaken assumption that the sand storms and bad weather would mask movement from coalition surveillance and counter strikes . This was the last semblance of any apparent coordination or central direction of Iraqi forces and the order to counter-attack may have been the last order given by Saddam Hussein to his forces. There had been very little semblance of control to this point in the campaign, but thereafter, there was none, and Iraqi forces operated in a random and chaotic manner.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>This point in the campaign was also critical from the coalition perspective. Resistance from the militia had interrupted the logistic tail and there had not been the mass surrender of Iraqi regular forces that military planners had hoped for. Coalition forces had been fighting for 5-6 days and although not short of ammunition they needed to be re-supplied with food, water and fuel. The dilemma for CENTCOM was whether to consolidate the remarkable success that had been won thus far and give time for 4th Mechanised Infantry Division to marry up with its equipment in Kuwait and move north, or to press on against the Republican Guard in its prepared defences and attack Baghdad. Much would now depend on the effectiveness of &lsquo;shock and awe&rsquo; and coalition air attacks to wear down the Republican Guard. At this point the Republican Guard divisions, presumably responding to higher orders to counter-attack and believing themselves covered by the storms left their prepared defences and in doing so made themselves even more vulnerable to air attack. CENTCOM decided that the two pronged attack on Baghdad by 5 Corps and 1 MEF should continue.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>At about the time of the attempted counter-attacks from Baghdad, British Challenger II tanks had a major meeting engagement with a column of 14 Iraqi T55 tanks, all of which they destroyed. As in the north, it would appear that the foggy weather had convinced the Iraqis that they could manoeuvre unobserved by British tanks. But this was not so and after a troop of Royal Engineers had laid an over-bridge across a canal to allow the Challenger tanks to manoeuvre to a position of advantage, they were able to engage and kill the entire Iraqi force. This Iraqi move may have been part of a wider countrywide and coordinated counter attack by Iraqi forces or simply a tactical redeployment.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>At this stage, personnel from the 4<sup>th</sup> Mechanised Infantry Division began to arrive from the United States, just as their equipment was beginning to arrive in Kuwait . As a result, General Franks could open the northern front in order to confuse the Iraqi leadership and take the pressure off the southern approach to Baghdad.&nbsp; Some 1,000 troops from 173<sup>rd</sup> Airborne Brigade were parachuted into Kurdish controlled northern Iraq to seize Hirir airfield east of Kirkuk, working alongside Special Forces who had been operation in the north for several months. Tanks and armoured vehicles were expected to follow, albeit slowly, to provide heavy support to the Kurdish Peshmerga as they attempted to gain control of the key towns of Mosul and Kirkuk.</p>
			<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
			<p>The fact that the Iraqi army had not surrendered as a direct consequence of &lsquo;shock and awe&rsquo; seems to have come as a surprise to some analysts, particularlythose who had over-estimated the effect of air power after the Kosovo air campaign. But for the military planners at CENTCOM that was only ever a &lsquo;best case scenario&rsquo; .The resistance by the 20-40,000 Fedayeen and their hold over the people, even the Shia Muslims in the south, had come as a surprise. Military planners had anticipated a major uprising by the Shia Muslims against Saddam in the south.&nbsp; The absence of such an uprising was, however, of tactical rather than operational consequence. The defeat of the Republican Guard counter attacks around Baghdad and Basra, was, arguably, the point at which the campaign tipped decisively in favour of the Coalition.&nbsp; By this stage, Royal Marines had taken the al-Faw peninsula and US marines had seized the strategically important oil-fields of Rumelia. The strategic port of Umm Qasr was in coalition hands within five days. Basra was surrounded but had not yet been captured. Two break outs from Basra by Iraqi forces had been attacked and destroyed .&nbsp; The Iraqi leadership had been attacked in Baghdad and their command and control systems had been severely undermined. The counter-attacks by the Republic Guard were the last evidence of any central direction. The two prongs of the alliance push to Baghdad had made remarkable progress, coming within 70 miles of Baghdad . All key bridges were firmly in the control of coalition forces.&nbsp; The northern front had been opened by linking 173<sup>rd</sup> Airborne with Kurdish and Special Forces, and in the west US, UK and Australian Special Forces had seized key airfields.&nbsp; No Scud missiles had been fired at Israel. By 1 April, a battalion from the US 173<sup>rd</sup> Airborne Brigade had completed its deployment into northern Iraq.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>The Siege of Basra: 21 March-7 April</h3>
			<p>As early as Day 2 the old strategic port of Umm Qasr had been secured and the 1<sup>st</sup> (UK) Armoured Division was able to switch its main effort westwards to encircle Basra. On 22nd March, Basra airport was taken and bombing raids were subsequently conducted against regime targets in the city. On 24th March British infantry attacked the Ba&rsquo;ath party HQ in Zubayr, 15 miles west of Basra, while artillery began to engage Iraqi forces defending Basra. On the same day a column of up to 50 T55 tanks tried to break out of Basra but were engaged and halted.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The raid on the Ba&rsquo;ath Party HQ in al Zubayrwas an early indication of the likely approach that would be used as the attack gathered momentum around Basra and other major towns. Initial tactics were to surround the town or city and then attack headquarters, destroying Saddam&rsquo;s command and control arrangements and his ability to counter these raids, while conducting probing attacks to look for exploitable weaknesses elsewhere.</p>
			<p>By 25th March Basra was completely surrounded. 26th March saw reports of an uprising in Basra, with Iraqi civilians being attacked by the Fedayeen and Saddam&rsquo;s militia. On 27th March 14 more Iraqi T55s were destroyed by British tanks as they tried to move towards al-Faw. During the following week British forces conducted various other engagements that allowed them to gain control of the Shatt-al-Arab waterway and the suburbs of Basra, and to lay siege to Iraqi forces in the city centre.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>On 28th March, the first substantial allied shipment of humanitarian aid to Iraq arrived at the docks of Umm Qasr. On 30th March, coalition air and ground forces captured the suburb of Abu al Khasib after 15 hours of fighting . Once again, the assumption that Shia Muslims would rise up against Saddam&rsquo;s regime at the first opportunity had proven false. The coalition had underestimated the grip of fear that was still being exerted by the Ba&rsquo;ath Party and Saddam&rsquo;s militias. Instead, Basra was surrounded, and 16 Air Assault Brigade conducted a major engagement north of the oil fields at Rumaila, destroying seventeen Iraqi T55 tanks. A patrol from the UK Special Boat Squadron (SBS)attacked the Ba&rsquo;ath Party Headquarters building containing up to 200 militia fighters, which was then destroyed in air-strikes .&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>For a little over a week British forces watched, probed and waited, testing resistance in Basra. According to one assessment of the British position, British forces were by this stage doing &ldquo;what the British do best &#150; wielding an iron fist in a velvet glove. Once it was realised that Basra would not come over to coalition forces, the British went into their standard &lsquo;urban mode&rsquo; combining aggression against the bad guys, friendship with the majority and patience with everyone.&rdquo; <a title="" name="_ftnref8" href="#_ftn8">[8]</a><i>&nbsp; </i></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>On 7<sup>th</sup> April shortly after 5.50am , having invested Basra for nearly two weeks, British tanks and armoured fighting vehicles mounted a three pronged attack - Operation Sinbad - into the city centre. Three British soldiers were killed in the action, along with many Iraqis. The operation, based on intelligence gathered during the preceding two weeks, was driven by the judgement of the commander of the 1<sup>st</sup> (UK) Armoured Division to the effect that the situation had reached &ldquo;tipping point&rdquo;, with organised resistance about to collapse. Iraqi forces withdrew to their last stronghold, the district of Manawi Albashi, where they were defeated piecemeal.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3><b>The Battle for Baghdad: 1-10 April</b></h3>
			<p>Ten days before the entry of main forces into Iraq, the UK&rsquo;s national contingent commander described Saddam&rsquo;s plans to suck coalition forces into street warfare in Baghdad, in the manner of the German siege of Stalingrad. [NEED A SOURCE FOR THIS] According to intelligence reports Saddam has constructed two concentric defensive lines around Baghdad, manned by five Republican Guard divisions of about 40,000 soldiers. Another defensive ring inside the city consisted of about 20,000 Special Republican Guards dedicating to protecting Saddam and his regime.</p>
			<p>On 16th March, <i>The Sunday Times</i> reported 120,000 Iraqi troops deployed in three defensive circles around Baghdad<a title="" name="_ftnref9" href="#_ftn9">[9]</a>. These now included 50,000 Republican Guards equipped with 700 tanks, fighting alongside three units of Special Forces amounting to another 45,000 troops. A further 20,000 Special Republican Guards and several thousand bodyguards were reportedly assigned to protect Saddam and the regime&rsquo;s most sensitive targets. The Adnam Tulfah Mechanised Republican Guard division was reported to have moved from Mosul to Baghdad to be followed by the Baghdad division from al Kut. A Republican Guard tank brigade was also reported to be moving in to reinforce the defences of Baghdad. The outermost of the three circles was about 30 miles out from the city centre and manned by three Republican Guard Divisions &#150; Medina to the west, Baghdad to the south and El Amarah to the northeast. This was reputedly the &lsquo;red line&rsquo;, where Iraqi commanders had been given authority to use chemical weapons. The middle line was reportedly manned by the remaining Republican Guards while the inner circle, within the city, was the responsibility of the Special Republican Guard, the Special Security Organisation and Saddam&rsquo;s Fedayeen<a title="" name="_ftnref10" href="#_ftn10">[10]</a>.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>More than 5 million people live in Baghdad and its environs and it was anticipated that the Republican Guard would make a bloody stand in the city and its suburbs.&nbsp;&nbsp; The coalition, however, did not intend to play Saddam at his own game, and would use its superior technology to identify and bypass Iraqi static defences. From the start of the war Republican Guard positions in Baghdad, and the regime&rsquo;s key installations , had been subjected to continuous air attack and to armoured reconnaissance patrols.&nbsp; .&nbsp; By 1<sup>st</sup> April US forces had started to probe Iraqi positions around Baghdad, while coalition aircraft continued regular bombing runs. With improvement in the weather about 29th March, battle damage assessments showed that Republican Guard divisions on the outer line of Baghdad&rsquo;s defences had been made virtually inoperable by coalition air and artillery attacks. However, considerable resistancewas still being offered by the Medina, Nebuchadnezzar and Baghdad Divisions . After fierce exchanges of fire, several thousand Iraqis and fewer than ten US troops were killed . At this time the level of desertions began to increase, with Republican Guard troops surrendering to coalition forces or making their way individually or in small groups into Baghdad City.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>By 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> April 1 MEF, on the eastern approach to Baghdad, had seized the strategic town of al-Kut and routed the Baghdad division which &ldquo;folded without resistance.&rdquo;<a title="" name="_ftnref11" href="#_ftn11">[11]</a>&nbsp; Having seized a vital bridge over the River Tigris, 1 MEF began manoeuvring to confront the al-Nida division. On the western approach, 3rd Mechanised Infantry Division, supported by elements of the 101<sup>st</sup> and 82<sup>nd</sup> Air Assault Divisions had encircled Karbala, defeated the Medina and Nebuchadnezzar divisions , crossed to the eastern bank of the Euphrates and were also advancing to the outskirts of Baghdad. This effectively put US forces inside the Red Zone, which signals intercepts indicated had been declared a free-fire zone for Iraqi chemical weapons.</p>
			<p>Nevertheless, with the defeat of the Republican Guard divisions on the outer ring of Saddam&rsquo;s defences, the way now lay open to assault Baghdad. Up to this point the Iraqi defence plan had been lamentable; even the major bridges on the Euphrates and Tigris rivers on the major approaches to Baghdad were only lightly defended. That said, the armoured approach to Baghdad by 1 MEF and the 3rd Mechanised Infantry Division supported by coalition air power, was a remarkable demonstration of manoeuvre warfare&nbsp;&nbsp; In the air, coalition sorties were proceeding apace , attacking strategic targets in and around Baghdad.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>On April 4<sup>th</sup>, US forces attacked Baghdad airport. By 5<sup>th</sup> April Baghdad airport had fallen to Special Forces and a major assault by 3rd Mechanised Infantry Division. CENTCOM in Qatar indicated they hoped to be able to land aircraft at the airport within 12 to 36 hours. With control of a strategically crucial airhead, the problem of extended supply routes was much reduced. Attack helicopters and close air support aircraft could henceforth respond in minutes. The resistance inside Baghdad continued but was incoherent and sporadic. Instead of the highly trained elite units that were expected, most firefights were with small elements of Saddam loyalist militias using hit and run tactics.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>By 6<sup>th</sup> April Baghdad was surrounded by the 101<sup>st</sup> Airborne Division pushing in from the north, 1 MEF from the north east and south east, and 3<sup>rd</sup> Mechanised Infantry Division from the west and south west . Having surrounded the city, the next stage, which was conducted without any pause so as to maintain operational tempo, was for US forces to begin armoured probes into the city centre by patrols of up to 30 M1A1 Abram tanks and armoured personnel carriers. Properly known as &lsquo;reconnaissance by force&rsquo;, these missionswere quickly dubbed &lsquo;Thunder Runs&rsquo;. Some Shia Muslims and even some Sunnis welcomed US forces into the city, and resistance to these armoured patrols was sporadic . At the same time columns of civilian vehicles packed with civilians and probably military deserters were fleeing northwards out of the city towards Tikrit, expected to be Saddam&rsquo;s final bastion. The limited resistance encountered, however, fell far short of a coordinated, detailed and ferocious defence in the mould of Stalingrad.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>As a result, the decision was taken to mount a major armoured push into the centre of the city, to finally tip the balance of the battle of Baghdad in the coalition&rsquo;s favour. In the words of one newspaper report, &lsquo;This was to be no cautious, street-by-street nibbling away at the capital. It was an almighty sledgehammer blow. In an instant, General Blount [commanding the 3<sup>rd</sup> Mechanised Infantry Division] rendered obsolete decades of military wisdom on how to take a city.&rsquo; <a title="" name="_ftnref12" href="#_ftn12">[12]</a> Able to respond quickly and decisively to the collapse of the Iraqi defences, the soldiers who took part in the battle for Baghdad nevertheless found it hard to believe it would be over so quickly and straightforwardly. The symbolic moment of victory was, of course, the destruction of the statue of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in the centre of Baghdad on 9<sup>th</sup> April 2003.</p>

			<h3>Fall of Kirkuk and Mosul</h3>
			<p>Within 7 days of the start of the war, Kurdish Forces supported by US and British Special Forces and coalition air forces were closing in on Kirkuk. The front-line town of Qarah Anjir, the first in northern Iraq to fall, had been hastily abandoned by Iraqi troops as they fled south to more defendable positions. . This opened the way for further US deployments into Harir airfield, which had earlier been occupied by one of the 173<sup>rd</sup> Airborne Brigade&rsquo;s battalions. However, it was not until 10th April that Kirkuk and Mosul fell to the Kurdish Peshmerga and coalition Special Forces. The Pentagon admitted that its troops were in Kirkuk, but declined to say that American forces controlled the city, although a Pentagon spokesman confirmed that elements of the 173<sup>rd</sup> Airborne Brigade would follow later. [NOT CLEAR &#150; FOLLOW WHAT??]Responding to Turkish concerns and US pressure, Jalal Talabani, the Iraqi Kurdish leader said his forces would hand over the city to US forces and withdraw within 24 hours.<a title="" name="_ftnref13" href="#_ftn13">[13]</a></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3><b>Fall of Tikrit &#150; The Last Redoubt</b>.</h3>
			<p>By 13<sup>th</sup> April, US Forces had pushed north from Baghdad with 250 armoured vehicles and were engaging Saddam&rsquo;s forces in the outskirts of Tikrit. A CENTCOM spokesman described fighting as &ldquo;spotty&rdquo; but added &ldquo;We are actively engaging any forces we need to. When we are engaged in a fire-fight it is always fierce.&rdquo; [NEED A SOURCE FOR THIS QUOTE] With Iraqi resistance estimated at just 2,500 troops, CENTCOM soon confirmed that the mass of the Adnan division of the Republican Guard, given responsibility for defending Tikrit, had evaporated.When US marines in armoured vehicles, under air cover provided by Apache helicopters pushed into the city on 14<sup>th</sup> April, resistance melted away altogether and Saddam&rsquo;s last redoubt fell to US forces.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>As US marines captured the centre of Tikrit, the heart of the Ba&rsquo;ath party and Saddam&rsquo;s home town, Brigadier General Vincent Brooks speaking at CENTCOM in Qatar indicated that decisive military operations were <i>&lsquo;coming to a close&rsquo;. </i>Soon after, the Pentagon announced that two of the five aircraft carriers deployed in the region &#150; USS <i>Kitty Hawk </i>and USS <i>Constellation </i>&#150; were being recalled with their complements of aircraft .</p>
