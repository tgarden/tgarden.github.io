			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>The campaign launched against Iraq on 20 March 2003 came to an end just weeks later, with the symbolic toppling of a statue of Saddam Hussein in central Baghdad on 9<sup>th</sup> April, and the fall of Tikrit, Saddam&rsquo;s home town, on 14<sup>th</sup> April.&nbsp; On 1<sup>st</sup> May 2003 President Bush declared major combat operations &#150; known as Operation Iraqi Freedom in the United States, Operation Telic in the United Kingdom and Operation Falconer in Australia &#150; to be complete, during a carefully staged visit to the aircraft carrier USS <i>Abraham Lincoln </i>off the coast of California.<a title="" name="_ftnref1" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a></p>
			<p>Focusing largely on ground and air forces. this chapter draws together some of the military implications of a campaign in which intensive operations lasted barely a month, and in which lower scale military operations still continue to occupy coalition forcesThe chapter will offer judgements as to the strategic and tactical approaches of both coalition and Iraqi forces, and will analyse the campaign against a doctrinal template of current western military thinking.&nbsp; The chapter begins with a brief review of the historical and diplomatic background to the war of 2003, assessing the legacy of the first Gulf War of 1990-91, and the military implications of the diplomatic activity that preceded the war of 2003.</p>
			<h3>Historical Context and Diplomatic Constraints</h3>
			<p>When Iraq invaded Kuwait on 2 August 1990, the international community responded in near unison. The UN authorised military action for a clear&nbsp; breach of international law. Most of the states in the region became part of the US-led coalition. Saudi Arabia, sharing borders with both countries, became the main mounting base for the military operation.&nbsp; An extraordinary coalition of 34 nations<a title="" name="_ftnref2" href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> built up their air and ground forces over five months, before launching a major air campaign on 17 January 1991. Coalition air and missile attacks continued for nearly six weeks. Allied air supremacy was achieved, and the continual bombardment of Iraqi defensive positions set the conditions for a rout when major ground operations began on 24 February. With some 660,000 military personnel deployed for the operation, just 100 hours of land operations were needed to expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait. The conflict cost the coalition 340 deaths, of which one quarter were caused by &lsquo;friendly fire&rsquo;.<a title="" name="_ftnref3" href="#_ftn3">[3]</a>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>From 1992 onwards, American, British and (until 1998) French military aircraft patrolled much of the skies of Iraq in the Northern and Southern no-fly zones. When the work of UN weapon inspectors became impossible in late 1998, they were withdrawn and Operation Desert Fox was mounted. American and British aircraft flew more than 650 strike and strike support sorties, while 415 cruise missiles were launched against key targets in Iraq.&nbsp; Over a period of 70 hours an intense air campaign was mounted to degrade Iraqi capabilities, which it was thought might be used to produce or deliver weapons of mass destruction.<a title="" name="_ftnref4" href="#_ftn4">[4]</a>&nbsp; Following 9/11, the US and a number of allies mounted a major offensive military operation against terrorist bases and the Taleban leadership in Afghanistan. Long-range air power from aircraft carriers and distant bases meant that this was a less intense bombardment than seen in previous campaigns. Nevertheless, using air attacks, special forces, and local forces, it proved possible to remove the Taleban regime.</p>
			<p>The Gulf War of 1990-91, followed by air operations against Iraq during the 1990s and then operations in Afghanistan after 9/11, all meant that by 20 March 2003, when the latest attack on Iraq began, US and allied forces had accumulated over a decade of what was to prove to be crucial operational experience in the use of precision weapons to shape the battlefield for effective land operations.</p>
			<p>The scope and pace of diplomatic activity &#150; at the United Nations, across the Middle East and in Europe &#150; affected military preparation and the nature of the campaign plan. In 1990-91, the US-led coalition enjoyed not only a UN resolution authorising military action, but also the support of 34 nations. The consequent benefits of basing rights, host nation support, over-flying rights and direct military assistance were very significant, as were the financial contributions from a number of governments.&nbsp; In 2003, in military terms at least, the US would have been able to conduct the campaign on its own.&nbsp; Nevertheless, George Bush claimed credit for having assembled a coalition of more than 40 nations.<a title="" name="_ftnref5" href="#_ftn5">[5]</a>&nbsp; The list of coalition members was curious in some respects; Turkey, in spite of its refusal to allow basing rights, was shown as a member while Qatar, where the main military headquarters was located, was absent from the list. Furthermore, the military contribution of states such as Micronesia and the Solomon Islands could hardly have been significant. In terms of military forces, the main contributors were the UK with 45,000 troops, Australia with 2,000, and a small number of Polish troops. By any objective measure, the 2003 operation was not militarily as well supported as that in 1990-91.&nbsp; What was far more important to the US effort, was to find a suitable local mounting base. Kuwait provided that facility, with CENTCOM headquarters being based in Qatar and thereby allowing some dispersion of forces.&nbsp; The unwillingness of Turkey to provide a second mounting base to the north was a major challenge to US planning. The number of forces immediately available was reduced, and military planners also had to take account of the historically and strategically complex relations between the Kurds, the Turks and the Iraqi regime . The absence of Turkish bases removed the option of invading from Turkey and thereby increased the overall risk to coalition forces.</p>
			<p>The campaign was constrained in other, more immediate ways.&nbsp; It was clear from the outset, for example, that concerns over civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure would narrow the scope of military activity. As a result, targeting decisions would be closely controlled to ensure that, as far as possible, tactical actions would not have an adverse effect on long-term political goals and post-conflict peace building.&nbsp; The campaign would, in other words, be fought with the speed of the German World War II <i>Blitzkrieg</i>, but without its destructiveness.&nbsp; Furthermore, and in spite of the much-discussed aversion of western armed forces and their governments to battlefield casualties, it was understood that ground forces would probably have to accept more casualties than they would expect if a less discriminating targeting approach had been taken.&nbsp; The climate was another constraint on military planning.&nbsp; Before the start of the campaign in March, much was made of the debilitating effect upon personnel and material, of operating in the Iraqi summer and consequently of the need to start operations before the end of April, at the very latest. Climatic considerations might well have been raised by the coalition&rsquo;s military commanders in order to speed the political decision-making process and in order to create time for military units to be positioned and prepared to conduct operations.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Diplomatically, the need for UK Prime Minister Blair to be given time to show that United Nations diplomacy had run its course, and for him to persuade his own political party of the legality of the war, imposed considerable extra pressure on the Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ) at Northwood and on the UK&rsquo;s liaison staff at CENTCOM in Tampa, Florida . While CENTCOM&rsquo;s planning staff were generally sympathetic to the need for their UK counterparts to delay deployment decisions for political reasons, delays imposed by the Prime Minister&rsquo;s office did cause some embarrassment for UK commanders.</p>
			<h3>Concept of Operations</h3>
			<p>The concept developed at Tampa, Florida by General Tommy Franks and the staff at CENTCOM was for a joint (maritime, land, air, space) campaign, initiated by an air-led assault - the &ldquo;shock and awe&rdquo; campaign.<a title="" name="_ftnref6" href="#_ftn6">[6]</a> The land assault was planned to be from the north out of Turkey and the south from Kuwait. The northern front was to be led by the 4<sup>th</sup> Mechanised Infantry Division supported by Kurdish forces, and the southern attack on Baghdad was to be two pronged, with the 3<sup>rd</sup> Mechanised Infantry Division taking the western axis along the River Euphrates (Najaf, Karbala, Hillah) and the major elements of the 1<sup>st</sup> US Marine Corps Expeditionary Force (1 MEF) taking the eastern axis to Baghdad along the general line of the River Tigris through Kut. The UK&rsquo;s major land component of 1st Armoured Division consisted of 3 Commando Brigade, 16 Air Assault Brigade and the 7<sup>th</sup> Armoured Brigade. 3 Commando Brigade was to seize the al Faw Peninsula, Umm Qasr and Abadan, and along with the 7<sup>th</sup> Armoured Brigade Iraq&rsquo;s second city of Basra. The taking of Basra was designed to mask the right flank of the US main effort towards Baghdad. This masking manoeuvre was the principal task of the 7<sup>th</sup> Armoured Brigade and it was hoped that early successes in Basra would undermine the morale of the regime in Baghdad. Air assault forces of the US 101<sup>st</sup>&nbsp; and 82<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp; Airborne Divisions, and the UK&rsquo;s 16 Air Assault Brigade would be used to seize and hold strategic targets and oil-fields, to act as a reserve, and to conduct a series of feints and deception operations designed to compound the confusion of the Iraqi high command.</p>
			<p>The joint concept of operations required rapid establishment of air superiority in turn enabling large-scale, simultaneous precision attacks against the Iraqi regime infrastructure, military centres and communication systems. At the same time, a rapid advance on the ground from both the north and the south towards Baghdad would take advantage of the aerial disruption to the centre of power. Subsidiary actions to secure western Iraq to keep Israel out of the war, and to secure oil facilities against destruction would be mounted simultaneously by special forces. .</p>
			<p>The traditional insistence on achieving a three-to-one superiority over an enemy before beginning a campaign was put to one side<a title="" name="_ftnref7" href="#_ftn7">[7]</a>. The coalition went to war with the minimum of ground troops &#150; fewer than half those available for the relief of Kuwait in 1991 &#150; and with only about one third of the tanks that were considered necessary to drive the Iraqi army out of Kuwait in 1992. As a result, Iraq&rsquo;s tank force outnumbered that of the coalition by approximately 1,500 to 320.&nbsp; Comparison might also be drawn with NATO&rsquo;s Kosovo operation in 1999.&nbsp; For an area equivalent to just four per cent of the territory of Iraq, and with only one tenth of Iraq&rsquo;s population, NATO deployed on this peacekeeping (rather than combat) operation with approximately five brigades &#150; roughly 40 per cent of the size of the coalition force sent into action on 20 March 2003.&nbsp; <b>&nbsp;</b><b></b></p>
			<p>The coalition concept of operations, and its subsequent execution, fuelled considerable debate between two schools of military thought . On one hand were those who advocated a heavy and cautious approach, and on the other thosewho preferred a lighter and more manoeuvrist approach. What General Wesley Clarke described as the advocates of &ldquo;a new kind of war&rdquo; against the &ldquo;plodding old arm thinkers.&rdquo;<a title="" name="_ftnref8" href="#_ftn8">[8]</a>To a considerable extent, the debate is a legacy of the Cold War. Those military officers who had been schooled in the armour-heavy and dimensionally limited culture of the Cold War were more comfortable with the &lsquo;Powell Doctrine&rsquo; of overwhelming force,&nbsp; rather than the multidimensional, manoeuvrist approach favoured by the current generation of senior officers. The first Gulf War of 1991 had been a campaign of the Cold War genre, and perhaps the last of its kind; coalition forces confronted an opponent using mainly Soviet equipment and tactics, precisely the enemy they had prepared for over decadesBut in 2003, US Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld championed the multidimensional, manoeuvrist school in spite of the concerns of senior retired military officers that too few troops were being committed. Rumsfeld&rsquo;s novel &lsquo;light, lean and mean&rsquo; doctrine &#150; &ldquo;What will follow will not be a repeat of any other conflict. It will be of a force and scope and scale that has been beyond what has been seen before&rdquo;<a title="" name="_ftnref9" href="#_ftn9">[9]</a> &#150; certainly prevailed in the combat phase of the campaign, but the lack of so-called &lsquo;boots on the ground&rsquo; limited the ability of the coalition to win the peace.</p>
			<h3>Style of Operations</h3>
			<p>In several ways, coalition operations in Iraq demonstrated the style and sophistication of modern western military thinking and capability.&nbsp; The campaign in Iraq was driven by new thinking in a number of ways: manoeuvrism; mission command; network-centric warfare; campaign design and joint vision and planning.</p>
			<h3>Manoeuvrism</h3>
			<p>The armed forces of America, Britain and Australia aspire to the manoeuvrism in military operations; taking the indirect approach and applying strength against identified weakness, rather than attacking main forces and fighting a war of attrition. Hence the desire by General Franks to press on to Baghdad, perceived to be the Iraqi regime&rsquo;s centre of gravity, rather than destroy the Republican Guard forces and Iraqi regular army piecemeal en route. The campaign in Iraq, with its emphasis on psychological warfare, on the destruction of Saddam&rsquo;s command and control systems, and on the maintenance of operational tempo, has been a classic example of manoeuvre warfare. Manoeuvrism stresses the need to defeat and disrupt the enemy&rsquo;s will to fight, by taking the initiative, attacking from the least expected direction, and by applying constant and unacceptable pressure at the times and places the enemy least expects. Manoeuvrism calls for an attitude of mind in which doing the unexpected and seeking originality is combined with a ruthless determination to succeed. The demands of originality and unpredictability were certainly put to the test when Turkey refused access to US forces . The air and psychological warfare campaigns were designed to &lsquo;decapitate&rsquo; the regime, and to set the conditions for the two-pronged mechanised attack from Kuwait.&nbsp; The attack would be led by the 3<sup>rd</sup> Mechanised Infantry Division and the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force, supported by the UK assault on Basra and a series of feints by the air assault forces and actions by special forces in the west to prevent Scud attacks upon Israel. Coordinated and synchronised, these various assaults, using different means, in different domains, were designed to attack, destroy, dislocate and disorientate Saddam&rsquo;s leadership, command and control infrastructure.</p>
			<p>Manoeuvrist thinking lies at the heart of asymmetrical warfare, and is particularly attractive to a numerically inferior force; it should be noted that Iraqi combat forces outnumbered those of the coalition by a ratio of 3:1. However, the manoeuvrist approach does entail the risk that disruption of the enemy will not occur as predicted and hence can seem less predictable and reliable than the use of overwhelming force. This dilemma was at the heart of the debate between those who wanted more troops to be deployed and thereby reduce the risk of failure &#150; the &lsquo;Powell doctrine&rsquo; of overwhelming force &#150; and those who were prepared to risk Rumsfeld&rsquo;s light option.&nbsp; But the essence of manoeuvre warfare is thata certain level of casualties is inevitable and that reverses at the tactical level can be accepted if they are necessary for the maintenance of operational tempo and the achievement of operational goals. Those critics who argued that the coalition plan had stalled because Iraqi forces had been by-passed rather than being destroyed piecemeal, demonstrated an alarming ignorance of the well-publicised manoeuvrist approach&nbsp; In practice, however, attritional and manoeuvrist forms of attack are not mutually exclusive styles of warfare, and any operational plan is likely to contain elements of both. The manoeuvrist approach would not, for example, exclude the use of attrition by coalition air forces at a decisive point to wear down Iraqi ground forces, or to gain maximum psychological effect. Hence the coalition&rsquo;s focus on the Republican Guard; their demise would have been a severe psychological blow to Saddam&rsquo;s regime as well as devastating his fighting capability.&nbsp; Manoeuvrism also, finally, attacks the enemy commander&rsquo;s decision making process by achieving a faster decision making cycle, often described as &lsquo;getting inside the enemy&rsquo;s OODA loop&rsquo; (&lsquo;Observation, Orientation, Decision and Action&rsquo;).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The enemy is challenged to make decisions at a rate faster than he can cope, so that he takes increasingly inappropriate action or none at all, thereby paralysing his ability to react. This is the essence of pre-emption and disruption, which are key to the manoeuvrist approach.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><b>Mission Command</b></p>
			<p>Mission command is central to the manoeuvrist approach to operations and has four enduring themes: timely decision making; a clear expression of the commander&rsquo;s intention; an ability on the part of subordinates to fulfil the commander&rsquo;s intention; and the determination, at all levels of command, to see the plan through to a successful conclusion. All this requires a decentralised style of command that promotes freedom and speed of action and initiative, yet all within a clear understanding of the superior commander&rsquo;s intent and subject to his broad direction.&nbsp; Mission command gave American, British and Australian commanders the flexibility to test the defences in Basra and Baghdad, by the use of armoured raids (reconnaissance in force) and then, on meeting minimum resistance, to exploit the situation to the full. Mission command delegates authority to the lowest level in order to give junior commanders the maximum flexibility to exploit a &lsquo;high-speed&rsquo; battle space. The more traditional Cold War style of &lsquo;directive command&rsquo; would have insisted that commanders in Iraq refer tactical decisions to the highest level, and as a consequence would have inhibited the ability of the commander of 3<sup>rd</sup> (US) Mechanised Infantry Division and the commander of 1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp; (UK) Armoured Division to develop innovative approaches to invest and capture Baghdad and Basra respectively. Tactics were developed ad hoc, at the tactical level, rather than relying upon a more traditional and cautious street by street, block by block approach that would have been both more destructive and expensive than the imaginative approaches that were employed. Within their area of responsibility commanders were allowed to determine when, where and how to exploit the operational &lsquo;tipping point&rsquo; when it became clear.</p>
			<p><b>Network-Centric Warfare</b></p>
			<p>&lsquo;Network-centric warfare&rsquo; was another obscure expression much-used by the media and in public debate before, during and after the conflict. The ideas behind network-centric warfare are scarcely new; throughout history, reliable information and intelligence about enemy actions and intentions has been considered vital to military success.&nbsp; In the context of manoeuvrism, high quality, timely information is key to the ability operate within the enemy&rsquo;s &lsquo;OODA loop&rsquo;. What became clear in Iraq in 2003, however, was that the latest surveillance, processing, communications and weapons could give coalition forces a considerable manoeuvrist advantage.&nbsp; Network-centric warfare could speed up the coalition&rsquo;s OODA process by ensuring maximum connectivity and speed between target identification and attack. The linking of satellite information and real time visual displays from drones (such as Predator and Phoenix) with special forces reconnaissance and contact reports allowed for precision air strikes by orbiting aircraft within just minutes of target identification.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><b>Campaign Design</b></p>
			<p>Within CENTCOM&rsquo;s campaign plan constructed at Tampa and then Qatar , several key indicators would have been defined precisely: the desired end-state, Iraq&rsquo;s centres of gravity, and the decisive points in the campaign.&nbsp; That said, the sequence of activities and the designation of the main effort or critical path would have remained entirely flexible in order to allow maximum exploitation of the situation as it unfolded around Basra and Baghdad. Seen in this way, a modern campaign plan can be viewed as a preconceived series, or matrix, of subordinate contingency plans that are structured along different lines of operation along which decision points will be identified when new paths can be taken for operational advantage. The campaign plan will be revised and refined as often as time allows.&nbsp; Although the coalition would have had a preferred path of action, campaign planners would have considered and anticipated innumerable contingencies. The planners would also, of course, have built in some level of redundancy in order to cope with the vagaries of warfare; the so-called &lsquo;fog of war.&rsquo;</p>
			<p><b>Joint Vision and Planning</b></p>
			<p>The various doctrinal concepts and planning tools are all pulled together into what the American military refer to as the &lsquo;Joint Vision&rsquo;.&nbsp; The US Joint Vision has the following features</p>
			<ul>
				<li>&sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dominant awareness &#150; see first, understand first.
				<li>&sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Decision superiority. Dominant manoeuvre &#150; strategic, operational, tactical.
				<li>&sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Precision engagement.
				<li>&sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Full dimension protection.
				<li>&sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Focused logistics.
				<li>&sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Agile, adaptive force.
				<li>&sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Technological edge.
				<li>&sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Superior training.
				<li>&sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dynamic doctrine.<a title="" name="_ftnref10" href="#_ftn10">[10]</a>&nbsp;
			</ul>
			<p>In accordance with the precepts of the US joint vision, the plan for Operation Iraqi Freedom was conceived as a sequence of phased military objectives:</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<ul>
				<li>&sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Special operations and psychological preparation of the battle-space.
				<li>&sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Distributed and parallel ground and air operations to:
				<li>&sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paralyse the Iraqi leadership and command and control system
				<li>&sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Control key centre and assets (to include SCUD capabilities)
				<li>&sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set the conditions to seize and sustain the initiative in the ground campaign
				<li>&sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set the conditions for a viable post-war Iraq.
				<li>&sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ensure bearable Syrian, Iranian, and Kurdish impacts
				<li>&sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Protect the oil-fields
				<li>&sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prevent massive pollution of the Gulf
				<li>&sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Find and control WMD and facilities
				<li>&sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rapid advance to fix the Republican Guards divisions
				<li>&sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Massive air attacks to further reduce the Guards divisions
				<li>&sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter Baghdad from several directions
				<li>&sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Occupy the rest of Iraq
			</ul>
			<h3><b>The Role of Special Forces </b></h3>
			<p>Special forces were much used before, during and after the campaign, among them the UK&rsquo;s Special Air Service (SAS), with its Australian and New Zealand sister organisations, the UK&rsquo;s Special Boat Squadron, and from the United States the Delta Force and Sea Air Land (SEAL) teams.<a title="" name="_ftnref11" href="#_ftn11">[11]</a>&nbsp; Within 48 hours of the start of the campaign, the Iraqi airbases H2 and H3, near the border with Jordan, were captured by about 150 men from three SAS squadrons including 100 Australian SAS troopers. These airfields were subsequently held by Royal Marine Commandos and US Rangers so that the SAS could be deployed elsewhere against other high value targets. The seizure of the airfields was the role for which special forces had originally been formed; the capture or destruction of high value military objectives behind enemy lines.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Throughout the campaign special forces were deployed in their more traditional mode to attack headquarters and key communications nodes in the Iraqi fibre optic communications network.&nbsp; Special forces were also deployed to seize strategic oil-fields by <i>coup de main</i> operations, and to search for and destroy weapons of mass destruction and Scud missiles in order to prevent their use. The majority of operations were successful but not all. No weapons of mass destruction or Scud missiles were deployed and fired, but equally none were found. The only known disaster came near the northern city of Mosul when a patrol, reputedly from the UK SBS, was dropped too close to Iraqi troops and had to conduct an emergency extraction operation, leaving its vehicles and equipment behind. All patrol members were extracted safely but their vehicles and equipment were exhibited by the Iraqi authorities and provided them with one of their few public relations successes.</p>
			<p>What was new in this campaign was the rapid transfer and management of human and signals intelligence from the special forces such that strategic targets could be attacked within minutes by air delivered precision weapons. The attempts to attack and kill Saddam Hussein and his sons Qusay and Uday, as well as other key individuals, were classic examples of this shortened &lsquo;kill chain&rsquo;. From the very first attack on the night of 19<sup>th</sup> March on the Dora Farm in Baghdad using cruise missiles and bunker-busting bombs, to the attack on the al-Saa restaurant in the affluent al-Mansour district of Baghdad on 7<sup>th</sup> April, to the attack against the Ba&rsquo;ath party headquarters in Basra, it would appear that new techniques had been developed to shorten the reaction time between the acquisition of strategic information and its tactical exploitation.</p>
			<h3><b>The Role of Air Power</b></h3>
			<p>During the the 1991 Gulf War, NATO&rsquo;s 1999 Kosovo operation and to some extent the campaign against the Taleban regime in Afghanistan after 9/11, the public became very aware of the aims, scale and impact of coalition air operations. The role of coalition air power in the 2003 campaign is as yet difficult to define precisely, although some lessons can be drawn.&nbsp; The role of Iraqi air forces is much easier to assess, since it appears that no Iraqi air operations were mounted throughout the operation.</p>
			<p>Coalition offensive air operations were conducted by surface and air launched cruise missiles, air delivered precision guided bombs and free fall ballistic bombs. One estimate of total bomb and missile expenditure is 29,199;<a title="" name="_ftnref12" href="#_ftn12">[12]</a> about the same number of munitions as used in the Kosovo air campaign, which lasted three times as long.&nbsp; Yet Iraq is 17 times the combined area of Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo. Daily strike rates averaged around 1000,<a title="" name="_ftnref13" href="#_ftn13">[13]</a> which is of the same order of magnitude as in the 1991 Gulf War.<a title="" name="_ftnref14" href="#_ftn14">[14]</a> The significant difference for the 2003 operation was that the majority (68%<a title="" name="_ftnref15" href="#_ftn15">[15]</a>) of weapons used were precision guided.</p>
			<p>The unplanned early start to operations is likely to have caused some difficulty in adjusting the Air Tasking Order rapidly. The normal cycle time of 72 hours is seen as a limitation on flexibility. According to USCENTAF,a special capability to find, fix, track, engage and assess the most important targets had to be developed. These were known as Time Sensitive Targets (TST) and comprised leadership, weapons of mass destruction and terrorism-related targets. Among more than 30,000 designated targets, only 156 were TSTs. It is not clear whether this ratio reflects lack of intelligence or capability, or that no more TSTs were needed.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The primary missions in the air campaign included the suppression and destruction of Iraqi air defence systems. These had been softened up before hostilities began through the intensified No Fly Zone operations. The large-scale availability of precision weapons meant that it was also possible to target the regime leadership and communication nodes at the same time. The strategy was to disconnect the regime leadership from its military commanders, and those commanders from their fighting units. Air superiority was achieved from the start. However, the resistance initially offered during ground operations in the south meant that air power effort had also to be directed to supporting the ground advance.</p>
			<p>The integration of ground and air operations made it possible for offensive strike aircraft to be used at times in more direct support of ground forces. A particular worry was the Iraqi defence line to the south of Baghdad, where three Republican Guard divisions were deployed. In late March, while sandstorms prevented the rapid progress northwards of US forces and hampered normal close air support missions, Iraqi defensive positions could nevertheless be attacked repeatedly with a range of munitions. One A10 squadron, for example, reporteda higher than usual&nbsp; usage of cluster bombs during this period, even though pinpoint targets were obscured.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Once the weather cleared, Republican Guard defences could again become the focus of offensive air operations. The capture of Tallil airfield outside Nasiriyah provided a refueling and re-arming facility for close air support operations. Strike aircraft with unused munitions from missions elsewhere were authorised to attack Republican Guard positions on their return flights. By 4<sup>th</sup> April, the Medina Division of the Republican Guard was estimated to be at less than 18% of full strength, and the Hammurabi Division was rated as below 44%.<a title="" name="_ftnref16" href="#_ftn16">[16]</a></p>
			<p>Throughout the campaign strategic attacks continued against selected targets in Baghdad. The use of penetration bombs to attack a telecommunications tower indicates that the communication nodes were a high priority. The apparent lack of cohesion in Iraqi defences may in part be attributable to a lack of communications from higher authority. Aversion to risking civilian casualties also limited some targeting, and in general the target selection process differed from the 1990-91 Iraq campaign. In 2003, bridges and major routes were not struck as coalition forces made rapid progress across the ground. Perhaps more surprisingly, the electricity facilities were largely left undamaged, either because of concerns about longer-term humanitarian problems, or in order to keep the administrative infrastructure in place to help post-conflict reconstruction.</p>
			<p>Despite its relatively low public profile, air power operations appear to have been the key to the rapid degradation of Iraqi defences, and hence to the relative ease with which coalition ground troops took over the country. The lack of any Iraqi air operations made little difference, as Iraqi aircraft would have been rapidly destroyed if they had attempted to fly. Over 1800 coalition aircraft were involved, 802 cruise missiles were fired, and enough fuel was transferred in the air to keep a 737 airliner flying for nearly twelve years.<a title="" name="_ftnref17" href="#_ftn17">[17]</a>It is not clear yet how important a role uninhabited air vehicles played, but it was the first time that Predator drones had been flown simultaneously in support of combat operations.<a title="" name="_ftnref18" href="#_ftn18">[18]</a>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3><b>Conclusion: Saddam&rsquo;s Defeat</b></h3>
			<p>By the time coalition forces reached the outskirts of Baghdad, Saddam&rsquo;s fate was sealed. Operating with little or no central direction, the much-vaunted Republican Guard divisions were quickly pinned down and then destroyed piecemeal in co-ordinated attacks by coalition aircraft and ground forces.&nbsp; Arguably, the Gulf War of 2003 was a war Saddam Hussein should not have fought. His once powerful armed forceshad not been able to make good the losses suffered in 1991.<a title="" name="_ftnref19" href="#_ftn19">[19]</a> Yet even at their best in 1991, his T72s and air force had proven no match for the tanks and aircraft of the United States and the United Kingdom.&nbsp; Saddam&rsquo;s defensive plan was seriously flawed, even though he had months to prepare. When it became clear that Turkey was unwilling to aloe an allied attack from the north, Saddam should have re-deployed his forces to confront the imminent attack from the south, the likelihood of which was clearly revealed by the positioning of the coalition&rsquo;s main forces in Kuwait . From an allied perspective, the southern option was high risk; limited disembarkation facilities, few manoeuvre options, a narrow front, a distance of several hundred miles from the operation&rsquo;s start-line in Kuwait to Baghdad, and the Rivers Euphrates and Tigris as obstacles along the way. Yet, other than to firethree missiles at coalition forces in Kuwait, Saddam did nothing to attack and disrupt coalition forces when they were concentrated and at their most vulnerable in Kuwait, by mining and sabotaging port facilities and demolishing key bridges over the Tigris and Euphrates.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most fatally, Saddam mis-oriented his forces . Saddam did not use well-known western casualty aversion to his advantage, by placing his main defences around Baghdad and by using a combination of minefields and other artificial and natural obstacles to slow down coalition forces and channel them into prepared killing zones.&nbsp; Instead of a fierce struggle against Saddam&rsquo;s six Republican Guard divisions in carefully prepared positions, coalition forces&nbsp; met Iraq&rsquo;s ineffective regular army, much of which simply melted away.&nbsp; Coalition forces were thus able to seize and maintain the initiative, and could embark on a relatively casualty-free run all the way to Baghdad. Given total air dominance by the coalition, the only options open to Iraqi forces were either to close with coalition forces or to operate from within urban areas and from behind the cover of the civilian population.&nbsp; But they did neither; only a few paramilitaries offered any meaningful resistance.</p>
