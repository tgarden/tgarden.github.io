			<p><font size="-2" color="#0b0b0b">The Hutton inquiry was formulated with a narrow remit to investigate the tragic death of Dr David Kelly. Yet, it has managed to reveal surprising new insights into the workings of modern Whitehall. The first phase  of the inquiry, taking  the chronological evidence, finished yesterday with those concerned with investigating Dr Kelly's death. But, right at the end, Dr Brian Jones and the mysterious Mr A, two members of the Defence Intelligence Staff,  were called to talk about their concerns last year as the September dossier was being drafted. Their evidence raises questions about the future of British intelligence.<br>
					<br>
					The DIS is a part of the Ministry of Defence which provides the intelligence assessments that are needed for developing defence policy, designing military equipment, developing doctrine and generally preparing our armed forces for any tasks that they may be given. Strategic and political intelligence is generated by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office which draws on its own Secret Intelligence Service (often tagged publicly as MI6). Communications have grown greatly in importance as a source of intelligence information over the years since Bletchley Park in World War 2. Its successor, the Government Communications Headquarters GCHQ, is currently undergoing a massive expansion at its home in Cheltenham.  These three intelligence providers have overlapping interests when looking at overseas threats.  As the public now knows only too well, government intelligence assessments are produced by the Joint Intelligence Committee, chaired by John Scarlett. This is the forum that can bring together all the different sources of internal and external intelligence to produce a best judgement on any subject of concern.<br>
					<br>
					JIC reports are traditionally dry reading. They weigh the probabilities and make sure the informed readership understands the reliability of the data. Drafters agonise over the difference between &quot;may&quot; and &quot;might&quot;. &quot;Broadly&quot; or &quot;Largely&quot; may be needed to modify a too certain assertion. None of this makes for exciting sound bites. Trying to produce a populist version of a JIC report was therefore a challenging project, and one for which there had been no experience to draw upon before Iraq. In this light, the exchanges between the spin doctors and the spooks should not surprise. The e-mails and notes  making drafting suggestions are part of a normal inter-departmental staffing process. The difference for the September dossier was that public presentation was a key factor. As Mr A says:   &quot;The perception was that the dossier had been round the houses several times in order to try to find a form of words which would strengthen certain political objectives.&quot; A letter from a former Chief of Defence Intelligence, Sir John Walker, appears among earlier evidence and says quite clearly: &quot;There is talk of the JIC paper traveling between the JIC and 'other places'. This would seem to be a change of procedure if correct.&quot;<br>
					<br>
					Tony Blair provided the sound bites in his forward to the dossier. He said: &quot;The picture presented to me by the JIC in recent months has become more not less worrying. It is clear that, despite sanctions, the policy of containment has not worked sufficiently well to prevent Saddam from developing these weapons&quot;.  He then drew attention to the disclosure  &quot;that his military planning allows for some of the WMD to be ready within 45 minutes of an order to use them.&quot; Few WMD specialist academics took these warnings very seriously at the time. The evidence from former inspectors was much less alarmist. Nor was the British public much moved after the publication of this dossier, and even less so by the &quot;dodgy dossier&quot; the following February. <br>
					<br>
					So does it matter, that two senior officials working with the DIS have now told the Hutton inquiry that they, and their colleagues,  expressed concerns about the wording in the dossier during its drafting, and that they were ignored? From Dr Jones's evidence, it appears that normal JIC procedures were not followed. Unfortunately, it does matter. The intelligence system is less than perfect. It has to work with incomplete evidence, unreliable sources, and uncertain outcomes. The different agencies and their mixed messages have to be distilled to provide the best objective advice for Ministers to take decisions. These decisions may lead to war. If a culture of shaping intelligence to meet political demands is developing, we will be less safe. The JIC cannot foretell the future, but it can do its best to weigh threats and dangers. The politicians must then decide on action. A discredited intelligence process may leave us exposed one day when there is a real threat and not just a phantom like Iraq.</font></p>
