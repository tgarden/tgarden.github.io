			<font size="-1">James Bond  is not the only one with a licence to kill: around 200,000 British soldiers, sailors and airmen can also be authorised to take lives. We rarely think of the extraordinary responsibility that we put on these young men and women. The submariner, launching a cruise missile, will be unleashing destruction on a distant target, selected by intelligence officers thousands of miles away. The planners may decide to use a precision guided bomb from a Tornado aircraft to strike a depot. The pilot and the navigator work as a team to fly to the launch point and release their bombs, trusting in the calculations of other men and women. Soldiers are often closer to the reality of war, but they too may be firing artillery at targets they will never see, and causing death and destruction miles away. <br>
				<br>
				The authority to wage war, and for the armed forces to kill, is rightly constrained by strict legal concerns at every level. As we approach the endgame over the current Iraq crisis, letter pages in the broadsheets are full of academic debates about legitimacy of armed intervention. Does UN Security Council Resolution 1441 make the use of force legal, or is something more specific needed?  Eminent international lawyers argue about whether a pre-emptive action  to overcome some future possible threat can ever be legitimate under the rules of the game. International law is more flexible and open to interpretation than its national counterparts. Nevertheless, military commanders will need to be assured that the intervention is legal. &quot;Just carrying out orders&quot; has not been an adequate excuse since the Nuremberg trials after  World War 2. <br>
				<br>
				On this occasion, the British government will claim that it can legitimately use force under extant UN resolutions about Iraq, and will find legal opinion to back this. Certainly senior British military commanders will need explicit guidance on the legality of what they will be ordering their troops to do. A clear audit trail of responsibility is a comfort in the new world of the International Criminal Court, whose judges are sworn in for the first time today.<br>
				<br>
				The need to keep within the law goes much further once troops are in combat. The laws of armed conflict are a key part of military training. The distinction between combatants and civilians must be made.    Force used must be proportionate, and civilians must not be targeted. Indeed targets selected must be justified on the basis that they contribute to the enemy's military effort. Weapons must not cause unnecessary suffering, and they must be able to discriminate between military and civilian targets. As the British Defence Doctrine manual reminds its readers: &quot;The morale of an enemy's civilian population is not a legitimate target and attacks designed to spread terror among the civilian population are expressly prohibited.&quot; <br>
				<br>
				The Geneva Convention and Protocols also rule strictly on the treatment of prisoners of war, and the sick and wounded. If, as predicted, many of the Iraqi conscript forces surrender in the early stages of the war, the Allies may find themselves devoting considerable logistic effort to the safety and proper handling of their prisoners. An even worse problem would arise in the aftermath of a chemical weapon attack by Saddam Hussein on his own people. The rules allow for no distinction between friendly and enemy wounded.<br>
				<br>
				Much of the legal complexity for the soldier, sailor and airman can be removed by providing clear rules of engagement. Strategic planners will observe the constraints, and will have legal advice for difficult cases. Yet problems arise in a multinational force.  National judgements on proportionality, discrimination and weapon effects may differ. The UK has signed up to the landmine ban, but the United States has not. New technology weapons may turn out to break the ban on weapons which cause unnecessary suffering. There may be differences over whether a particular facility (like a television centre) contributes to the military effort.  As Geneva protocols seem to have been suspended by the US in Guantanamo Bay, the discussions between Allies on these topics may prove more difficult than usual. With Tony Blair making the moral case for war, the pressure to keep to the rules will be intense. James Bond had it easy without the constraints of international law.</font>
