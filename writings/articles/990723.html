<H3><CENTER>The lesson of Kosovo is: more troops, not airpower

<P>Just twelve months after George Robertson's much acclaimed
strategic defence review, overstretch of our armed forces is worse
than ever. As the lessons of Kosovo are taken aboard, the Ministry of
Defence has some hard choices to make; and it is likely to need more
than just minor adjustments to its current plans.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The first key question is whether NATO air power is now so
powerful that we can safely relegate ground forces to the role of
heavily armed policemen, whose task is merely to enforce any future
peace settlements. The argument runs that the Gulf War was almost
totally an air operation with just a brief follow-up ground operation
required to confirm victory. The lessons from that were applied to
the Kosovo campaign, and as a result air power alone was able to
achieve the required end. Yet there is still great uncertainty as to
what it was that caused Milosevic to cave in. It certainly was not
the destruction of his forces in Kosovo, since we now know that they
emerged relatively unscathed. It may have been the cumulative effect
of the strategic targeting of Serbia, but there was little sign of
popular unrest during the bombing. It may have been the damage to the
wallets of his close supporters both through bombing and freezing of
assets. The ebbing support of Russia will certainly have made a
difference. Yet the territory of Kosovo was a vital national interest
to Milosevic, and his change of heart coincided with the first
indications that an allied ground operation before winter was being
seriously contemplated. Certainly, Tony Blair worked hard to keep the
option to use ground forces in play.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The planners will have learned the limitations of many weapon
systems when constrained to operate from 15,000 feet altitude in an
area with murky weather. So long as such operations are dominated by
the Americans, the safety of their forces will be an over-riding
operational factor. We need more weapons that can achieve the
necessary precision to minimise civilian casualties, yet can be
launched in any weather from a safe distance. For the UK, this will
mean not just replacement of the submarine-launched cruise missiles
which were used, but perhaps other launch platforms armed with cruise
missiles to make a much greater number available. It will mean an
emphasis on weapons that are guided by satellite navigation systems
to overcome the drawbacks of laser designation in poor weather. It
ought also to mean some questioning over the balance of investment in
fighters as against bombers. Nations were all too ready to provide
air defence aircraft, which allowed them to claim a contribution to
the air campaign, but had virtually no effect on the outcome. Once
the mission statistics are released, governments will spin their
contribution in terms of total sorties flown, when what matters is
how many weapons they successfully placed on target compared to the
United States.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>George Robertson's defence review has been tested before it has
had time to be implemented. It was reckoned to be one of the better
thought out attempts to balance commitments, capabilities and
resources. One year on, the commitments have increased, the
capabilities need rebalancing and the resources are tighter. On the
commitments side, KFOR has added to Bosnia, Northern Ireland, Iraq,
and the Falklands as another major operational task for the armed
forces. As the permanent lead nation for the Allied Command Europe
Rapid Reaction Corps, we can take pride in having craggy British
General Mike Jackson running the show; but it comes at the price of
an extra commitment of resources. In the past year, we have seen Tony
Blair pushing the UK into the lead on European Defence matters.
Proposals at St Malo for Europe to do better in defence matters, and
this week's Anglo/Italian declaration on European capabilities, are
significant changes since the defence review assumed a traditional
Atlanticist approach to foreign policy. Robin Cook last month
reversed our reluctance to allocate forces to the UN on anything but
a case by case basis. UK rapid reaction forces will now have a formal
UN task to add to their portfolio.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The rebalancing of capabilities for air systems in the light of
Kosovo will not come cheap. However, the real winners of the air
campaign in budgetary terms are likely to be the army. The
limitations on policy options of an army, which at 110,000 is now
numerically so small, must have been brought home to the Prime
Minister during Kosovo. The increase in army establishment by 3,300,
as part of the defence review, will be insufficient for the tasks
envisaged. But the problem is made more acute by the shortfall of
some 5000 soldiers against the current establishment. Recruiting is
reported as buoyant, which must mean that retention remains poor.
Repeated back-to-back tours of operational duty far from families
take their toll. The short term solution will doubtless call for
retention bonuses, which pay soldiers to stay on a little longer. In
the long term, overstretch can only be solved by fewer commitments or
more manpower. Nor is it only the army which has a manning problem:
the RAF has difficulties in sustaining its aircrew numbers given the
level of operational deployments and the disappearance of its
expensive, but useful, cushion of pilots in non-flying appointments.
Manpower costs for the armed forces are set to rise steeply.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Resources are never easy in defence. Predicting the costs and
timing of expensive military equipment is at best a black art, as the
National Audit Office exposes with some relish every year. The
Strategic Defence Review initiated a startling number of new schemes
to improve effectiveness and reduce costs. Smart procurement,
centralised logistics, joint force structures, rapid land sales and
the use of public private partnership funding, all need to deliver
their promise to balance the budget. It would be surprising if such
an adventurous agenda was able to deliver all it promised on time
even without the interference of real world events.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Tony Blair wants to capitalise on the UK's preeminence in
delivering professional military capability.Those returning to their
desks at the Ministry of Defence after their well deserved holidays
will be trying to find a way to meet the new policy commitments,
implement the lessons of Kosovo, and make the books balance. That is
likely to be impossible without a real increase in defence
expenditure of perhaps as much as &#163;2Bn. Gordon Brown may need to
start preparing his fortifications.</P>
