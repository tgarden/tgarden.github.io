<H2><CENTER>CHINESE NUCLEAR STRATEGY</CENTER></H2>

<P>Until as recently as the early l9th century, China was accustomed
to its traditional role as the Asian power. For 2,000 years, China
had seen itself as the 'middle kingdom': the centre of culture,
influence and power. The collapse of the Chinese empire, the
intervention of the European powers and the Communist revolution have
not necessarily changed the traditional perception that the Chinese
have of their world role. In 1943, Chiang Kai-shek, when speaking of
the imposition on China of unequal treaties, said:</P>

as a national humiliation, and not until all lost territories have
been recovered can we relax our efforts to wipe out this humiliation
and save ourselves from destruction. l </I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Professor Liu has drawn attention to the similarity of the views
of both the Nationalist and the Communist leaders in this respect.
Mao Tse-tung was equally bitter about the many dependent states and
parts of its territories which China had lost to the imperialist
powers. Both leaders recognised the traditional superiority of China,
and anticipated its future return to great power status.2
Nevertheless, the advent of a Communist government has meant that
ideology, rather than nationalism, is the declared driving force of
foreign policy. An examination of nuclear strategy must bear in mind
the undercurrent of the great power tradition.</P>

<H4>CHINA WITHOUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS 1949-1963</H4>

<P>Mao Tse-tung refused to acknowledge the importance of atomic
weapons. There was, however, no doubt that China expected to get the
technology, if not the bombs, from the Soviets. In 1953, the
Committee of Atomic Energy was set up in the Chinese Academy of
Science. In 1955, the Soviet Union announced that it would help China
to study the peaceful uses of atomic energy, and would provide a
research reactor. Two years later, the 'New Technology for National
Defence' agreement was signed, and in 1958, the first experimental
reactor came on line. The following year, the Soviets withdrew their
assistance and the Chinese were later to claim that this broke a
promise, given by the Soviets, that they would provide China with a
sample atomic bomb.3 It has been suggested 4 that the original Soviet
aid was provided to buy unity in the Communist world, and
subsequently delayed, in the hope that a Test Ban Treaty would stop
China from producing a bomb.</P>

<P>During this period, the Chinese leaders both advocated general
nuclear disarmament and also declared nuclear proliferation to be
desirable. The rationale for these apparently conflicting policies
was that either would break the nuclear monopoly of the United States
and the Soviet Union. On proliferation they said:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>Whether or not nuclear weapons help
peace depends on who possesses them. It is detrimental to peace if
they are in the hands of imperialist countries; it helps peace if
they are in the hands of socialist countries. It must not be said
undiscriminatingly that the danger of nuclear war increases along
with the increase in the number of nuclear powers.5 </I></P>

<P>It is suggested that Khrushchev personally made the decision,
based - on the suspicions of the independent course of the Chinese
missile development.6 It is a measure of the importance which Mao
attached to the programme that as early as 16 October 1964, they
tested their first static 20 kt atomic device. They rapidly increased
yields, and reduced size, and by the test of 17 June 1967, they had
exploded a thermonuclear device of 3 to 7 MT. The tests in 1965 and
1966 had included live aircraft and missile delivery respectively.'
The three years from first atomic test to first thermonuclear test
compares with eight years for the United States, five years for Great
Britain and four years for the Soviet Union. Those working on both
the weapons and the delivery systems development must have been
exempted from the excesses of the Great Proletarian Cultural
Revolution which began in September 1965.</P>

<P>Having successfully broken the nuclear monopoly, China seemed less
enthusiastic about the prospect of proliferation. Vice-Premier Chen
Yi in talking about nuclear cooperation with other countries, said in
1965, '... as for the request for China's help in the manufacture of
atom bombs, this question; is not realistic'.8 Although China refuses
to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty, there is no evidence that the
of ficial view has changed since the policy expressed by Chen Yi. It
has also been necessary to accommodate the possession of nuclear
weapons with the policy of nuclear disarmament. To explain the
position, Premier Chou Enlai wrote to heads of government on the day
following the first test:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>The Chinese Government consistently
stands for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of
nuclear weapons. China has been compelled to conduct nuclear testing
and develop nuclear weapons. China's mastering of nuclear weapons is
entirely for defence and for protecting the Chinese people from the
US threat. The Chinese Government solemnly declares that at no time
and in no circumstance will China be the first to use nuclear
weapons.9 </I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>As China did not test its first intercontinental ballistic missile
c until as recently as 1980, this nuclear strategy of protecting
China from the United States is difficult to follow. Yet the stated
policy was to bring nuclear retaliation to the American homeland. In
1965 the Defence Minister said:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P>US imperialism relies solely on its
nuclear weapons to intimidate people. But these weapons cannot save
US imperialism from its doom ... If it threatens other countries with
nuclear weapons, US imperialism will expose its own country to the
same threat.10</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The 29 issues of the secret Chinese military journal, Kung-tso
T'unghsun, which were acquired by the United States government give
some insight into the more realistic top level thinking in the
Chinese military in the early 1960s. Hsieh concludes, from an
examination of these journals, that Chinese thinking about war with
the United States was entirely defensive.11 They expected an American
initiated attack as a 'bolt from the blue', with nuclear, biological
and chemical weapons. They realised their vulnerability for the next
three to five years, but they could still live to fight another day.
A leading member of the Military Affairs Committee, Marshal Yeh
Chien-ying said:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>The objective in a war is primarily to
annihilate the enemy, but attention should also be paid to the theme
of self preservation. Particularly under the present circum- stances,
weapons causing casualties on a large scale and mass destruction have
appeared in use. We cannot annihilate our enemy unless we pay enough
attention to the preservation of our lives and strengths. We should
not only prepare ourselves against the use of such weapons by our
enemy in a sudden attack, but also safeguard ourselves from disaster
when we ourselves employ them.12 </I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In addition to the deterrence of American attacks, nuclear weapons
were also seen as a means of encouraging those peoples who were
engaged in revolutionary wars. A number of the nuclear tests were
accompanied by statements similar to this One of 9 May 1966,
following the third test explosion: 'The Chinese people's possession
of nuclear weapons is a great encouragement to the peoples who are
fighting heroically for their own liberation'.13 It is unlikely that
the Chinese intended any direct application of their tiny nuclear
forces to revolutionary wars; but the rhetoric may have been aimed at
- making the American nuclear guarantee less credible t o pro-Western
states in Asia. As the stockpile of weapons -- increased, the
statements accompanying each test became more specific. After the
tenth test, a three megaton bomb on 20 September 1969, the statement
specified 'encouragement and support' given by Chinese nuclear
weapons to the Vietnamese, the Laotians and the Palestinians, and to
the people of all countries who are fighting for the people's
liberation. 14 It is difficult to postulate a consistent nuclear
strategy ; through Mao's time, given the internal turmoil of 1966 and
1967, the widening rift with the Soviets, and the eventual
rapprochement with the United States in 1972. Richard Nixon saw the
warming of relations with America coming from the increasing concern
about China's potentially hostile neigh- bours: Russia, India and
Japan.l5 Gelber saw the Chinese as having five objectives: national
security; regaining the lost great power status; extending influence
in Asia; regaining lost territories; and leadership of the Communist
world.16 One can draw a number of parallels with the French view of
nuclear strategy, if this was the case. He went on to describe how,
as a lesser nuclear power sharing a common frontier with Russia, 4
and possibly in conflict with either it or America, China has
cultivated a strategy of 'strategic ambiguity': leaving everyone
uncertain as to their strategy. There is much to support his view
that:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>There is no evidence that Peking
considers these matters principally in terms of scenario writing, or
that the usefulness of a Chinese force need depend on precisely -
formulated strategic purposes. 17 </I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>AFTER MAO</H4>

<P>The Chinese nuclear strategy after the death of Mao in 1976 was
not made any clearer by the internal power struggles which took
place. Test explosions continued, with a record four in one year in
1976, but there have been none reported since 1980. Rocket
development has also continued. However, there seems to be no urgency
in deploying operational forces. The force of less than 150 missiles
are all liquid fuel, and hence vulnerable to first strike attack. The
few hundreds bombs can only be delivered by aging Soviet-designed
bombers, which would have little chance of penetrating Soviet air
defences. One submarine had been produced in 1970, with missile
launch tubes, but the missiles were not tested until ten years later.
Thus despite all the development effort, there seems to be little
effort to make the force credible. It has been suggested 18 that
China has not worried about fielding an invulnerable second strike
force because it no longer believes that there is a threat from the
Soviet Union: or that the people's war doctrine, with a limited
nuclear capability, and credible civil defence is an adequate
deterrent posture; or that it is worth waiting, despite the risk,
until technology makes these weapons cheaper. The tests of the long
range missile, CSS, in May 1980 show that the intention to keep up
the development programme remains. That it is prepared to bear the
economic burden, without gaining a significant operational
capability, suggests that China's strategy is predominantly that of
an insurance policy, against future world developments.</P>
