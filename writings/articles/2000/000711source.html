<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">There will be very few tears shed in the
White House or Whitehall over the catastrophic failure of the US
missile defence test on 7 July. The momentum for a United States
National Missile Defence (NMD) system appeared unstoppable. Yet
President Clinton was unhappy at the prospect of going down in
history as the man who broke the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty.
Now he has an excuse for leaving the critical decisions on deployment
to his successor. He may opt to start ground preparations for a radar
site on an island off Alaska, given the long lead time that is needed
for working in such an inhospitable climate. However, given the
uncertainty of the technical development timescale, he would be more
sensible to let the building work slip for another year. Either way
the decision will have more to do with what the focus groups say than
any rational strategic analysis.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In Whitehall, the relief will be
considerable. The UK had a special place in the US plans. Fylingdales
was set to be upgraded as one of the NMD radars detecting incoming
missiles. Menwith Hill was also to be integrated into the system to
provide space-based data on missile launches. Both of these upgrades
would have been in breach of the current ABM treaty. Even if the US
had successfully renegotiated the treaty with the Russians, the UK
would have been left with real difficulties. From a British defence
aspect, the two establishments would become very attractive targets
for any potential attacker, but would not provide any missile defence
capability for UK territory. The British government would therefore
have been providing  added security for the US, while reducing the
security of its own citizens. There is also a European dimension.
Most of continental Europe has been against deployment of NMD on the
grounds that it will not work, but will encourage China and Russia to
increase their nuclear weapons. Had the UK been required to decide
about Fylingdales, it would again have been making an uncomfortable
choice between its relationship with the USA and with its fellow EU
members.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Geoff Hoon was sounding ever more
unconvincing with his mantra that since the US had made no request,
he had no opinion on the matter. In fact, the UK government handling
of the affair appears to have been much more astute than it is being
given credit for. The "don't ask, don't tell" approach to this policy
issue has allowed quiet diplomacy to indicate the UK's concern to the
US government. Reports from Washington indicate that the strength of
European feeling in the early part of the year on NMD took US
officials by surprise, and has resulted in some delay to their
timetable for negotiations with the Russians. With luck, Whitehall's
NMD policy problem can be filed away for another year. However, it
has not gone away forever, and it might be useful to use the time to
hammer out a common European policy.</FONT></P>
