			<h3>2002: Global Trouble from A to Z</h3>
			<p>by Sir Timothy Garden</p>
		</div>
		<p>It is customary to take the opportunity of a new Year to look forward with optimism to brighter prospects . In the field of international relations, this is more difficult than usual. The terror attacks of 11 September 2001 have alerted the world to a new source of insecurity. Not that there has been any lack of other intractable international problems on the table. The focus by the USA almost exclusively on the &quot;War on Terror&quot; gives plenty of opportunity for these other problems to fester. From Argentina to Zimbabwe there are signs of the fragility of democracies when the economy goes wrong. In this forward look at the coming year, we can do no more than put up the warning flags for the hazardous route that the international community will need to navigate over the next twelve months.<br>
			<br>
			The most pressing problem is to reduce the tension between India and Pakistan. Both are now on a war footing and have a primitive, but nevertheless operational, nuclear weapon capability. An early agreement over Kashmir is unlikely, but Pakistan (encouraged by the US and Tony Blair) may crack down on its fanatical groups, who started this cycle of violence with the attack on the Indian parliament. A war between India and Pakistan would not only be deeply damaging to both countries, it would complicate the international counter terrorism campaign by an order of magnitude. <br>
			<br>
			The second flashpoint remains the Israel/Palestine conflict. Swept off the front pages first by Afghanistan and now by India and Pakistan, the problem shows no sign of solution. The return of the US envoy, General Zinni, at least indicates some form of continuing engagement by the USA, but the portents are not good. Just as Islamic terrorists are destabilising the situation between India and Pakistan, so the suicide bombers can give Israeli Prime Minister Sharon the excuse he seeks for further action against the Palestinians. This continuing cycle of violence makes any peace process near impossible. Arafat is losing the always tenuous control that he had over the different Palestinian factions, and increasing violence is likely. This would suit Iraq very well, and the possibility of some military support  from Saddam Hussein for the Palestinians cannot be ruled out, particularly if the Arab world begins to come together more strongly against Israel.<br>
			<br>
			Europe entered the New Year with the inner 12 Eurozone nations celebrating the Euro appearing on the streets for the first time. It will now turn its focus on to the process of enlargement. The agenda for taking in up to a dozen new countries is complex and the time short, with the first expected in 2004. This may mean that the EU will be spending much of its effort on internal matters, and paying less attention than it should to the rest of the world. Already, the worry is that this is what, in a different way, the United States is doing. Focused on eliminating threats to America from terrorists and rogue states, the US may have even less patience with the building of global security through international co-operation. Arms control is just about dead as the US withdraws from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, having already failed to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, sabotaged the Biological Weapons Protocol and looked to replace the nuclear weapons reductions treaties by verbal agreements over Texas barbecues. <br>
			<br>
			It may be a rocky year ahead for NATO. While the rapid declaration of total support for the US after 11 September was impressive, the actual contribution that the Alliance has made has been much less so. Europeans are likely to take a different view from the Bush administration over the next stage of the war against terrorism, and this will keep NATO out of play. The Prague summit at the end of the year will mean that NATO groups will be discussing its enlargement for much of this year. While this is likely to be less acrimonious than last time, there will still be difficult judgements to be made. If the Baltic Republics are taken in (and Russia seems more relaxed about this possibility), then how will Romania and Bulgaria  react if they have to go to the end of the queue again? NATO may opt for a large enlargement with all the strains that that will add. <br>
			<br>
			Elsewhere in the world, particularly in Africa, Indonesia and South America there are plenty of problems which will need help from the international community. The United Nations may at last make some progress on reforming itself, but it will be a difficult process. The economic portents are not good for these regions.<br>
			<br>
			For UK foreign and security policy, there will be a range of difficult problems. The Balkans are not yet fully stabilised, and UK ministers are well aware that the effort there needs to be maintained. But shortages of British troops, coupled with a wish to lead by example around the world, may mean taking risks with currently relatively peaceful crisis areas. The pressure from the UK military chiefs for greater resources will be very strong this year, but so will the pressure on the Chancellor from other quarters. The Treasury may question the cost of the high intensity warfare capability, when this aspect has in Kosovo and Afghanistan been left largely to the Americans. For much of the Government, this is going to be year to convince the British public that the Euro is a good think for the country. If they fail, the UK will be outside the Eurozone for a long time.<br>
			<br>
			Finally, in looking forward to the next twelve months, the real possibility of some new mass terror attack cannot be discounted. The most likely target remains the USA, but Europe is also at risk. The countermeasures to enhance security will affect us all. If they fail, the implications are unpredictable. Another major attack on a centre of population in the USA might cause a much less measured response than was seen last year. A successful attack in the UK would bring into question the Government's competence. Although under fire for the poor quality of the public services, the handling of foot and mouth, and management of major projects like the Dome and the national stadium, success in the Defence area has given Tony Blair international standing. Apparent complacency over national security might change the political landscape rather rapidly. Let us hope this aspect of Government is not put to the test.</p>
