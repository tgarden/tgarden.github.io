			<h3>Letter from America</h3>
			<p>by Sir Timothy  Garden</p>
		</div>
		<div align="left">
			<p>Coming to the USA on holiday for the first time since 11 September makes one realise  how different the country is now, and how the differences from Europe are even sharper. The Florida Keys are at their usual sunny best with the temperature in the low 80s. November to April is the high season as Americans traditionally try to escape from the freezing temperatures in the rest of the country. But this February there is no difficulty in finding a lounger by the pool, or a table in the restaurant. The few customers seem to include a disproportionate number of Brits who have chased the sun for their winter break.<br>
				<br>
				It is the weekend of the great sporting contest, the Super Bowl, which is to be held in New Orleans. Yet the news channels are more interested in the security arrangements than the form of the  players and the likely result. Spectators are advised to arrive five hours before the start of the game so that they can go through the stringent security procedures. Mobile phones are now suspicious objects, and the fans are advised to dress lightly and carry nothing but their wallets.<br>
				<br>
				On the same headlines, new security measures for airport checks are announced. Mobile phones, pagers, laptops, consumer electronics and even electric toothbrushes are now objects of suspicion. They will be wiped down and the swabs tested for explosive traces. It looks like  the flight check- in may take longer than the flight.<br>
				<br>
				But surely all this continuing focus on the war on terrorism must be good for UK/US relationships after Afghanistan? Tony Blair would be disappointed to know that the Sunday edition of the Miami Herald, the local heavyweight (both in use of trees and content), fails to mention TB at all. The comment is full of the annual security conference held in Munich. The US delegates are reported as making it clear to the Europeans that they will be expected to support a campaign against Iraq, and in more tangible ways than just moral support. The concerns of the Germans, and other delegates, over lack of consultation are quickly rebutted. Germany will have to spend more on defence if it expects to be consulted more. The Miami Herald reminds its readers that the increase in defence spending announced by George W.Bush is alone  greater than the total of the UK defence budget.  Certainly, the political credit for help in Afghanistan is now fading. The US Administration is judging its Allies by their preparedness for the next phase of their endless war against terrorism.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				Somewhat to my surprise, the press comment is not uniformly with the administration over its handling of the captives at Guantanamo Bay. It may be that the careful  approach of Colin Powell, the Secretary of State, has found resonance in the country. The Administration is on a charm offensive over how it is handling the prisoners. The latest news has been about the refurbishment of buildings to make a hurricane shelter. However criticism about the status of the prisoners continues to be a topic on this side of the Atlantic as well as in Europe. <br>
				<br>
				There is also critical comment about some aspects of the State of the Union address. The definition of Iraq, Iran and North Korea as an &quot;Axis of Evil&quot;  is accepted without much debate. They have after all been characterised that way for over a year in the missile defence advocacy. However, the Enron collapse is still unfolding, and its implications sit uncomfortably with the call to the citizens to give 4000 hours of their time to help the country in its time of need. Even if the Bush administration manages to keep its distance from the scandal, there are plenty of stories about how the members of it, including the President, made their fortunes. The question is being asked as to why ordinary Americans should give of their time, when the corporate leaders are robbing them.<br>
				<br>
				  As the budget goes into deficit, defence spending rockets, and the economy stumbles, politics may be starting again. Even Al Gore relaunched himself, complete with beard, this weekend. He seemed a more confident and relaxed character than he was as Vice President or as Presidential candidate. <br>
				<br>
				Finally, the political cartoonists and gossip writers have been enjoying the news that Attorney General Ashcroft's staff have arranged for the classical styled male and female sculptures at his office to  be covered with drapes. He has a reputation for being pretty fundamentalist in his religious observance, and the comparisons with the Taliban approach to statues and women have not gone unnoticed. <br>
