<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In a surprise move on New Year's Eve, the
Camp David press office released a statement announcing that
President Clinton will sign the International Criminal Court (ICC)
Treaty. This 1998 Rome Treaty has already had more than 130 signatory
countries, but it had been widely assumed that the United States
would maintain its strong opposition to the establishment of what
they saw as a supranational  court. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The statement is directed more at the US
domestic audience than at the international community. President
Clinton makes it clear that he is signing the treaty in order for the
USA to be in a position to influence the evolution of the Court.The
treaty needs to be ratified by 60 governments before it comes into
effect. It will then have jurisdiction over war crimes, crimes
against humanity and genocide wherever they occur. The US has been
worried that this put its citizens at risk of prosecution after
international intervention operations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The UK Government supports the ICC as does
the rest of the EU. For once the United States seems to be following
a lead from Europe. However there is a long way to go before the US
Senate can be expected to ratify the treaty. Indeed President Clinton
has recommended that his successor does not submit the treaty for
ratification until "fundamental concerns are satisfied."
Nevertheless, it is a very helpful move that President Clinton has
made in his last few days in office.</FONT></P>
