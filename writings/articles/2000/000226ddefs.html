<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Lessons of the 90's</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"> 	The end of the Cold War left  NATO with a
vast and expensive set of military forces, which had been training to
fight a single campaign for over 40 years. The planning assumptions
for an all out war in Europe were relatively simple. The enemy was
well defined and consisted of the aggregate forces of the  Warsaw
Pact. The exact locations, strengths of forces, tactics to be used
and phases of the war were studied by generations of soldiers. The
fall of the Berlin Wall, the unification of Germany, the demise of
the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union, all changed the strategic
landscape in Europe in little more than a 3 year period.  NATO's
purpose was suddenly in question as nations scrambled to cash in on
the peace dividend. Yet in the event, the decade of the 90's  had
more diverse military action by the Western nations, under various
banners, than at any time previously.  Kuwait, Iraq, Somalia, Rwanda,
Bosnia, Haiti, Albania, Kosovo and East Timor have seen western
military force deployed to less than benign environments. A new
doctrine for peace support operations has replaced the manuals on
flexible response and the air-land battle in the military staff
colleges of the Alliance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	This series of military experiences is
sufficient now to have established a strong consensus on the new
rationale for NATO, which was articulated in the Strategic Concept
launched at the NATO summit in Washington in April 1999. The
accumulation of data from real operations, rather than deterrence
postures, has highlighted major shortcomings in the security
capabilities available to the Alliance for these new tasks. The Gulf
War, while not a NATO operation, was conducted by an ad hoc coalition
drawn for the most part from NATO members. It was conducted using
NATO procedures with forces drawn from NATO formations.  It was a
relatively clear cut case for the international community to react to
aggression, and thus an almost ideal trial for the concept of
enforcing international law. Iraq had broken international law by
invading Kuwait, and the UN could authorise military action to expel
the invaders. Iraq had few friends among its neighbours; had an
oppressive regime with potentially dissident  groups; and  was 
remote to US and European publics. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The US led coalition was able to take its
time in building up military presence in the surrounding area. The
then novel doctrine of a prolonged precursor air campaign was tested
successfully.  Lack of casualties to the allies made the 6 weeks of
offensive air action acceptable to politicians and public. The much
greater availability of precision guidance for bombs had also set a
precedent in terms of what was to become acceptable collateral damage
in this type of operation. Nevertheless in 1991, even after the air
campaign phase, there was a general expectation that the ground phase
would involve traditional levels of casualties to the attacking
forces. In the event, the ground campaign was short and almost
casualty free for the allies. The 4 days of ground war reinforced a
new vision of  war: ground forces sent in only when it was safe to
secure the victory that had been won  relatively bloodlessly from the
air. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The Gulf  War showed that the US was both
quantitatively and qualitatively in a different  capability league
from all the other nations involved. As the French discovered, if you
could not operate to US/NATO procedures, then you were kept out of
the action. In the air, it was a war primarily of offensive air
operations, and these had to be conducted from medium to high
altitudes, where advanced defence suppression methods were more
effective. Air defence fighters had relatively little work to do. The
European nations had invested heavily in  fighters to protect
themselves from the long range Russian bombers of the Cold War. For
their offensive operations, they had depended on low flying tactics
to improve their survivability against Warsaw Pact air defence
systems, while accepting that there would be a significant attrition
rate. In a war that was expected to last only 5 days before going
nuclear, training and equipment were posited on achieving rapid
results. The European military equipment was not well structured to
the new doctrine.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The UN operation in Somalia reinforced the
perception, both in America and  internationally, that the US was
only prepared to remain engaged if their troops were kept safe. The
predominance of air power solutions to international crises was
underlined by the continuing air operations over both Northern and
Southern Iraq. Operation Provide Comfort had successfully, through
air operations, given relief to the displaced Kurds who had fled from
their homes in Northern Iraq. It was less clear that the results for
the Marsh Arabs in the South were as positive. While there was a need
for some fighter capability to police the air exclusion zones, this
could be carried out as the secondary role of either bomber or
reconnaissance aircraft. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The sequence of events in Bosnia
reinforced the US view that offensive air power could provide the
necessary coercion to bring recalcitrant leaders to the negotiating
table. That the history of the region up to the Dayton accord is
considerably more complex is unimportant. There is a widespread
perception among  American decision makers that the threat and
application of air strikes was critical to obtaining Milosevic's
agreement to the Dayton proposals. Again, in this short air campaign,
publics and politicians expected precision attacks with no collateral
damage and no losses to our own side. When an airman was lost over
hostile territory, combat search and rescue effort became the
over-riding priority. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The 1999 Kosovo air campaign brought
together all the political and military lessons that had been learned
in the post Cold War operations. The US had expended a good deal of
research on improving its precision weapons. Nevertheless, the use of
laser designation remained a significant constraint if the target was
obscured by weather. The two other precision systems (GPS navigation
and TERCOM ground mapping) were available both in bombs and cruise
missiles, but were significantly more expensive and limited to fixed
targets. They required access to US national data. Nevertheless, this
mix of weaponry allowed the campaign to be planned on a requirement
for no casualties to NATO forces  , and minimal collateral damage
from attacks. These constraints undoubtedly prolonged the air
campaign, but given that the required outcome was ultimately
achieved, we can expect future operations to have similar assumptions
about the requirement for very low numbers of casualties.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	 The contributions from the 14  NATO
nations which took part were varied as shown in figure 1  , but all
were overshadowed by the US, which provided 61% of the sorties flown 
. For example, the UK  carried out 1618 of the total of 38,004 NATO
sorties flown, or just  over 4%  . 102 of these sorties were the Sea
Harriers doing little more than defending the small  anti-submarine
warfare carrier that they were deployed on. 324 were air-to-air
refuelling aircraft aircraft  mainly supporting the Tornados that
operated from their bases in Germany. The UK E3-D airborne early
warning aircraft clocked up 184 sorties. The sorties which directly
influenced the outcome were those carrying out offensive attacks, and
here the total UK effort was in the range 4% to 10% depending on the
method of calculation (the lower figure reflects munition numbers and
the higher missions flown)  , and we know that in many of these cases
it was not possible to release weapons. From 1008 RAF bombing sorties
just 1011 weapons were released.   Of these three quarters were
non-precision weapons.   The story is similar for the other non-US
NATO air forces. The US provided 70% of the total aircraft and 80% of
the total weapons delivered.   Europe was shown to be good at
providing political support for the operation, but poorly equipped to
contribute to an offensive air campaign in an effective way. </FONT>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">What Air Assets are available or
Planned</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The United States Defence budget for 1998
was $267 bn  from a GDP of  $8.1 tr. Out of almost exactly the same
total GDP,  the EU nations together spent some $173bn on defence or
64% of the US total.    The US fields some 1.4 million professional
forces and almost as many ready reserves. The EU runs 1.8 million
troops of which 700,000 are conscripts and retains 3.6 million
reservists at various stages of readiness. These raw budget and
personnel statistics show clearly why Europe is so far behind the US
in its military hardware development. Europe fields more full time
troops, and very many more reservists, than the United States, yet
spends only half as much on defence. It is often claimed that the
major factor in differences in US and EU capabilities stems from an
all regular force in America being compared with a largely conscript
force in Europe. As can be seen from the figures, this is not the
main issue. If all conscription were eliminated, and two thirds  of
the reservists were released, the EU could field over one million
professional soldiers,sailors and airmen.  Adding in the 6 non-EU
European NATO members (Czech Republic,Hungary, Iceland, Norway,Poland
and Turkey) would raise the regular forces to almost exactly the 1.4
million of the United States and lift the total current European
aggregate defence spending to 70% of that in the US </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	If Europe, however defined, wishes to be a
more equal partner with the United States in its ability to intervene
internationally, it  needs to spend its defence money differently. It
is currently trying to support far too large a number of regular
forces, conscripts and reserves on too few funds. This means that
little is available for funding research, development and the
procurement of equipment and weapon stocks. While the United States
is scarcely a perfect example of tight control of defence spending,
it is nevertheless achieving a different order of military capability
for its expenditure. This suggests that Europe needs either to raise
its defence spending, or reduce and restructure its forces to match
the current spending more effectively. It is unlikely that there will
be much political enthusiasm among nations for raising defence
expenditure, and it is therefore more sensible to look at how
European nations might work together at restructuring their military
forces to provide more appropriate capabilities to the likely demands
of the future.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Finding a Defence Role for Europe</FONT>
</H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Before making any assessment of the
appropriate size and shape of future European armed forces, we need
to examine the nature of the current and future security need. NATO
members remain firmly committed to the organisation's collective
defence task. Individual national governments have a responsibility
for the territorial defence of their lands, which they  exercise 
through NATO membership. Yet the current threat to their territorial
integrity is very remote, and the planning assumption is that there
would be a long warning time of any newly emerging threat. It is
important that European governments analyse the degree of risk that
they are prepared to take in this area if there is to be a sensible
allocation of defence resources.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Much of the force structure in Europe is
still drawn from the Cold War days, when the priority was to deter
the threat of a short warning time invasion by Warsaw Pact forces
across the Inner German Border. The nature of such a threat
determined the requirement for forward defensive positions on the
ground supported by heavy armour with limited need for range. In the
air, the need was for very good early warning detection to direct
large numbers of air defence fighters and ground-based surface-to-air
missiles. Those countries, such as the United Kingdom, which were
further distant from the Warsaw Pact forces, could develop air
defences on the basis of long range engagement of incoming bombers.
At sea,  anti-submarine warfare was a high priority. Overlaying the
force planning process for this set piece campaign was the assumption
that if the conventional battle were lost, then nuclear weapons would
be used. For some European nations, this meant that there was little
investment in conventional (non-nuclear) long range interdiction
capability. Air to ground capability was designed more to assist the
ground battle and halt the advance of Warsaw Pact  armour. In sum,
the long period of the Cold War produced a force structure in Europe
that was designed for a short, high intensity conflict, where air
power assets, with the exception of nuclear forces, were primarily
defensive or in a support role. Air strategists might articulate the
arguments for interdiction and offensive counter air campaigns, but
in practice their most effective bombers needed to be reserved
against the potential need for early nuclear options. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	While the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989
could change the security context in less than five years,  it is not
 easy to restructure the armed forces of Europe as quickly. Some
changes in balance were possible through the cuts that took place
throughout NATO nations in the early 90's. However, some of the
reductions were made  soon after the end of the Warsaw Pact, when it
was still thought possible that Russia might be able to pose a threat
in a relatively short time. Thinking, as the 1991 NATO Strategic
Concept showed, still looked primarily at maintaining a defensive
posture, although with significantly lower readiness for most forces.
By the end of the decade, three members of the Warsaw Pact (Hungary,
Poland and the Czech Republic) had become full members of NATO, while
the rest, including Russia, had become formal partners with the
Alliance. Russia was so weak that it was finding great difficulty in
winning a conventional war in Chechnya. Only her decaying nuclear
weapon arsenal remained as a potential residual threat to the
security of the rest of Europe. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The UK Strategic Defence Review (SDR),    
which was started in 1997 and was published in mid 1998, is a
thoughtful analysis of the security concerns of one European nation.
It identified the positive results from the collapse of Communism and
the emergence of democratic states throughout Europe. It stated that
there was no direct threat to Western Europe, and that none was
foreseen, provided that efforts were made to continue to promote and
develop the constructive relationships between all nations of Europe.
On the negative side, the SDR identified a number of new security
risks. In particular, it pointed to instability inside Europe, citing
Bosnia and Kosovo, as a threat to the UK's security. The SDR went on
to say: "Instability elsewhere - for example in Africa - may not
always appear to threaten us directly. But it can do indirectly, and
we cannot stand aside when it leads to massive human suffering." 
This was the first statement of humanitarian intervention as a
national security driver. The Review also identified the growing
threat from proliferation of nuclear, biological and chemical
technologies, particularly from a number of hostile regimes. Finally,
it reminded the reader of the new risks to security from drugs,
organised crime, environmental degradation, terrorism and new
information technology vulnerabilities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The security threats as perceived by the
UK were in line with the general thrust of, and indeed helped to
shape, European and NATO thinking.  The successive crises in the
Gulf, Bosnia, Kosovo and East Timor have also had an effect on 
political perceptions of the utility of military force.  NATO decided
to formulate a new Strategic Concept, which would be launched at its
50th anniversary summit meeting in April 1999 in Washington. As
officials from member states began drafting they drew on the recent
experience in Bosnia, and were already contemplating what might
happen in Kosovo. The United States was seeking to extend the NATO
mandate  beyond its collective defence remit and possibly beyond
Europe. The concerns felt by some European nations changed as the
Kosovo crisis showed how necessary this change had become in
practice.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	When the Washington Summit took place,
NATO found itself fighting a major air campaign against Serbia and
showing that it was prepared to intervene beyond its national
boundaries. The official summit communique   was summed up as: "NATO
says it will expand its numbers and its functions". It announced that
the 19 member countries had:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The development of a coherent defence
policy for the EU had been an area of great difficulty for most of
the 90's. The UK had been particularly unhelpful, fearing that any
enhancement of the EU's role would be at the expense of NATO
cohesion. The logjam was broken by the Anglo-French summit at St Malo
in December 1998. Despite having predicated the just completed UK
defence review on a continuing NATO-centred Atlanticist foreign
policy, within six months of its publication, Prime Minister Tony
Blair was advocating a much more significant  role for Europe. The St
Malo Declaration  made it clear that: "the Union must have the
capacity for autonomous action, backed up by credible military
forces, the means to decide to use them, and a readiness to do so, in
order to respond to international crises"  . The declaration went on
to say:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">"In order for the European
Union to take decisions and approve military action where the
Alliance as a whole is not engaged, the Union must be given
appropriate structures and a capacity for analysis of situations,
sources of intelligence, and a capability for relevant strategic
planning, without unnecessary duplication, taking account of the
existing assets of the WEU and the evolution of its relations with
the EU. In this regard, the European Union will also need to have
recourse to suitable military means (European capabilities
predesignated within NATO's European pillar or national or
multinational European means outside the NATO framework)."
</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#000000"> </FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"> This was a radical change of position for
the British and opened the way to the further developments in 1999 in
European defence. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The Western European Union (WEU) had in
the past been seen as the main focus for European  defence efforts.
It had been circumscribed in terms of access to capability, a lack of
an adequate planning staff, and a degree of uncertainty over the
types of operation that it could take on. A consensus was emerging
that it would be necessary to hand over the task of providing
European defence capability from the WEU to the EU. The WEU
ministerial meeting in Bremen at the end of May 1999 took forward the
thinking that had started at St Malo and had been confirmed in
Washington. The apparently insurmountable difficulties of the
differences in membership between NATO, WEU and EU appeared to be no
longer a sticking point. They agreed that there was a "need for WEU
to be operationally effective with the involvement and participation
of all WEU nations in accordance with their status and to continue
its cooperation with the EU and NATO, in preparation for any new
arrangements which may be agreed in light of ongoing developments".  
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The Cologne European Council Declaration,
the following month, put this into a wider context, but picked up the
same points, when they  committed themselves in paragraph 2 </FONT>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">"to further develop more
effective European military capabilities from the basis of existing
national, bi-national and multinational capabilities and to

necessary adaptations and notably the reinforcement of our
capabilities in the field of intelligence, strategic transport,
command and control." </FONT></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">It is  significant that this was a
declaration by all 15 members including four neutral EU
countries.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Work continued in the UK to keep up the
pace of European defence developments. The Anglo-Italian declaration
of 20 July 1999 produced some concrete proposals on what needed to be
done.  It  widened the requirement from a need for an EU  capacity
for doing its own humanitarian, crisis management and peace support
operations (the Petersberg tasks).  The need for a more effective
European role in NATO was promoted as a clear lesson from Kosovo. The
declaration sought to develop a timetable to achieve European-wide
goals for enhanced military capabilities, and a set of national
capability objectives to achieve this European requirement. The
declaration proposed a peer review process with meetings of EU
Foreign and Defence Ministers twice a year to check progress towards
the agreed goals. This would take place in parallel with NATO's
Defence Capabilities Initiative (DCI) work. The DCI made the point
that NATO members would have to be able "to make a fair contribution
to the full spectrum of Alliance missions regardless of differences
in national structures." The DCI, like the Anglo-Italian declaration,
highlighted the need to develop a common assessment of future
requirements. However, it recognised the importance of the resource
dimension as well as the need for better co-ordination between
defence planning disciplines.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	In November 1999, the first joint meeting
of EU Foreign and Defence Ministers took place with Javier Solana,
the new EU high representative for Common Foreign and Security
Policy, in the chair. They looked at how Europe might be more
effective in the defence field and in particular provide capabilities
for Kosovo-like crises. A further Anglo-French summit occurred in the
same month, when the two main defence players in Europe launched
their vision for a new rapid deployment force of up to 60,000 men.  
This would require the EU to develop a Corps sized capability, which
could be deployed within 60 days and sustained for at least a year.
The force would be militarily self-sufficient with the necessary
command, control and intelligence capabilities, logistics, combat
support and appropriate naval and air combat elements.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">To develop European capabilities, Member
States have set themselves the headline goal: by the year 2003,
cooperating together voluntarily, they will be able to deploy rapidly
and then sustain forces capable of the full range of Petersberg tasks
as set out in the Amsterdam Treaty, including the most demanding, in
operations up to corps level (up to 15 brigades or 50,000-60,000
persons).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">These forces should be militarily
self-sustaining with the necessary command, control and intelligence
capabilities, logistics, other combat support services and
additionally, as appropriate,air and naval elements. Member States
should be able to deploy in full at this level within 60 days, and
within this to provide smaller rapid response elements available and
deployable at very high readiness. They must be able to sustain such
a deployment for at least one year. This will require an additional
pool of deployable units (and supporting elements) at lower readiness
to provide replacements for the initial forces.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The UK Government published its annual
(although this was the first since 1996) White Paper   on Defence
immediately after the Helsinki Summit. In examining the European
dimension  , the White Paper argues that European nations must be
able to pull their weight, and have an international influence
commensurate with their size and economic presence. To do this they
must find ways to provide genuine capability improvements, and that
the Helsinki European Council declaration provides the way forward.
The Prime Minister emphasised his commitment to improving the
European defence capability when he reported to the House on the
Helsinki summit:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">However, it would be a tragic
mistake--repeating mistakes of British European policy over the past
few decades--if Britain opted out of the debate on European defence
and left the field to others. This is a debate that we must shape and
influence from the start, because our vital strategic interests are
affected by it.   </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	We have now, in theory, an outline plan
for progress in improving European defence capabilities in a way
which works with the grain of NATO. That is a remarkable step forward
given the reluctance of the US and the UK in past years to address
these issues. But there are many difficulties ahead. NATO would claim
to have a planning process, and to have expended much effort over the
years on coercing nations into setting more challenging force goals
for themselves. In practice, the achievement of the process has been
limited, particularly in the past decade.The institutional
arrangements will almost certainly delay the development of the
agreed capability. Nevertheless, there are a number of measures that
might be taken in the field of air power capabilities, which would
make practical sense in any case.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">How much air power does Europe need?</FONT>
</H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	In order to look at the air power
capabilities that the European Union nations should field, we need to
make some assumptions about the scale of effort that it would be
appropriate for the EU to seek to provide. The EU and the US are just
about equal in terms of absolute wealth. The EU is more populous and
has more potential conflicts in its backyard than the US. However,
the US has formal security obligations in Japan and Korea as well as
in Europe. Taking all these factors into account, it might seem a
reasonable initial benchmark for European nations to seek to
contribute a usable military capability of the same order of
magnitude as the United States plans for NATO. The United States is
seeking to generate ten air expeditionary wings, each with about
15,000 personnel and 200 aircraft. Certainly Europe would not need to
aim for any greater capability than this. This would not be a recipe
for duplication, but a significant challenge for Europe. It would
make the Europeans equal partners when operating within NATO, and
would ensure a capability for operations on a European basis when
necessary. While in theory such a force should be affordable, in
practice it would require massive restructuring of the way military
forces are provided within Europe.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The UK Government has taken this need for
restructuring as a strong lesson of the Kosovo operation:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">...... in
co-operation with our Allies, we need to examine ways in which member
states can increase their qualitative and quantitative military
contribution to NATO's overall capabilities. The   priority lies in
such areas as precision attack weapons, secure communications and
strategic  movement assets. Interoperability of systems will, of
course, be a key component of this.</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000"> ..... there is a particular need to
boost European capabilities. In order to strengthen our ability  to
use force effectively, we Europeans need to improve the readiness,
deployability and sustainability of our armed forces and their
ability to engage in both high intensity operations and  those of an
expeditionary nature. This would strengthen our contribution to NATO,
which remains  the sole instrument for collective defence. NATO will
still be the natural choice for the conduct of non-Article 5 crisis
management operations which North American and European Allies might 
choose to undertake in the future. A strengthened European capability
would allow us to undertake European-led crisis management
operations, in circumstances in which the whole  Alliance is not
engaged. We strongly support the focus of the European defence debate
on these  key capabilities and the more effective targeting of
defence resources. We will pursue these aims  through NATO's Defence
Capabilities Initiative, and the Western European Union's audit of 
European capability. The work on performance criteria which we
launched with the Italians in July  will help to achieve this.

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The key elements for early work in
improving European capability are contained in this analysis.
Readiness, deployability and sustainability are identified as prime
drivers for force structures. Precision attack weapons, secure
communications and strategic  movement assets are highlighted as
areas for priority work. There are significant implications for air
power in all of these six issues.  Europe needs to completely
restructure its expensive, but unusable, military capability to meet
these challenges. While the focus of this volume is on air power
issues, it is impossible to look at air power in isolation. The funds
provided for defence purposes throughout Europe are unlikely to
increase without a significant change in threat perception. This
means that restructuring of capabilities will need to be achieved
within broadly the same resource assumptions as today. Thus, a
balance will need to be struck between the different elements of the
joint force structure. Nevertheless, it is possible to start by
making an initial unconstrained assessment of what air power assets
Europe should be able to deploy, and then assess how they might fit
into the resource priorities.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">A Theoretical European Air Power
Capability</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Using the Kosovo  campaign as a benchmark
for a modern military operation which should be within the capability
of European nations, we can break out the scale of effort that might
be needed in future. The campaign needed to be able to call upon the
traditional mix of air defence fighters, bombers, close air support, 
reconnaissance, airborne early warning, air-to-air refuelling,
strategic airlift, tactical fixed wing and rotary transport
capabilities. Although the maritime aspects of the operation were
limited, it must be assumed that some future campaigns might need the
appropriate mix of maritime reconnaissance, air defence, attack and
anti-submarine warfare air assets.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The EU nations together have elements of
all of these air power capabilities. They field some 3235 combat
aircraft with a total air force manpower of 380,000. If the NATO
non-EU members are added (Czech Republic, Hungary, Iceland, Norway,
Poland and Turkey) the numbers rise to 4281 combat aircraft and
530,000 men.   These large air power assets, as discussed earlier, 
are however balanced to provide the defensive posture that was
appropriate to the static defence requirements of the Cold War. All 
forces have a strong air defence element reflecting the requirement
to defend their own territory. While many of the fighters can be used
in a bombing role, they are not all weather capable and aircrew will
not have undertaken primary training in this role. For offensive air
operations, the only EU nations with  a significant capability  are
France, Germany, Italy and the UK, who can field around 500 aircraft
in an all weather bombing mode. Looking at the scale of offensive air
capability needed for the Gulf and Kosovo, Europe needs to work at
providing perhaps 50% more all weather bombers than it can at
present. This is an achievable aim if the priority given to the air
defence role is reduced.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	However, the platform is only part of the
question in modern air campaigns. It has become very clear that in
future operations, precision weapons will be the norm. Figures for
weapons stocks are not readily available, but inferences can be drawn
from the data of weapon usage in the Kosovo air campaign. Only 250 of
the 1011 UK aircraft weapons used were precision  , and for France
the total was 582 laser guided bombs. The French Defence Ministry is
quoted   as saying that they had an inadequate stockpile of such
weapons.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Approaches to Improving European Defence
Capabilities</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	In any discussion about improving European
defence capabilities, the argument usually begins with a plea for
more spending on defence. It is also argued that greater integration
of defence industries would be beneficial. Neither approach has much
prospect of early success, and there can be no confidence that either
would generate real enhancements in capability without a  radical
restructuring. 	Putting aside the political difficulties, Europe
could undoubtedly organise its defence spending more efficiently if
it was done on an integrated basis in the same way that the United
States organises its armed forces at the Federal level. Such an
approach for Europe will not be possible for many years (if ever), as
it will necessary for EU member nations to give up national
sovereignty to what is currently an unacceptable extent. There are
similar, although slightly less acute, difficulties with moves
towards allocation of military tasks to particular nations. This
"Role Specialisation" was much studied during the later stages of the
Cold War. Even with a common view of the mission, nations were
reluctant to become reliant on other Allies for particular
capabilities. Nevertheless a de facto specialisation has occurred as
European nations have been unable to match the technology of the US.
It may be that there will be a greater willingness for each European
nation to undertake fewer roles, but make those that they field more
effective. This approach will require close co-ordination if it is
not to open up yet more gaps in capability.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The proposals agreed at the 1999 Helsinki
Summit could provide an appropriate mechanism for co-ordinating
efforts between EU nations, and also keeping less enthusiastic
contributors up to the mark. It would allow nations to move towards
as much specialisation as they felt comfortable with, and to be
credited with real military contribution to the EU force
component.However this will take some years to develop. In the
meantime there is a danger that European capability will degrade
further. What is needed is some early action to improve capability
without assuming large budget increases. This can only be achieved by
looking for ways to reduce nugatory expenditure by cutting
duplication, unnecessary support overheads, and inappropriate
capability. This is a painful process even when carried out on a
national basis. It will be yet more difficult if it is to be carried
out on an EU basis. Nevertheless, it is the only immediate option
available, and can be done relatively rapidly given the political
will. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	If we look at the European forces as a
whole, we see duplication of headquarters, planning, training,
logistics support, procurement, research, bases and other facilities.
This would be bad enough if the scale of the frontline in each nation
justified the scale of the support infrastructure, but it does not in
nearly all cases. For the final section of this chapter, we will look
at how this opportunity for rationalisation could be exploited to
provide Europe with a more effective and appropriate air power
capability.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Opportunities for more effective operation
of European military forces are apparent in land, sea and air
capabilities. However, the air capabilities offer more easily
achieved improvements for a number of reasons. Air procedures are
already better harmonised between nations than is the case for land
and sea power. This is partly because of air safety issues and partly
because speed of operation means that communications, standard
operating procedures, rules of engagement, planning methods and
terminology must all be agreed, standardised and practised between
air forces which are likely to operate together. English has become
the universal language of the air, and these considerably eases the
problem of mounting international combined air operations. Given the
high unit cost of air force platforms, it is not surprising that many
nations operate common equipment. This also eases the problems of
rationalisation. Finally, the high costs of infrastructure to support
air operations means that modest rationalisation can pay high
dividends in achieving greater military capability at lower
cost.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Near Term EU Air Power
Rationalisation</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	In looking for opportunities to provide
more effective European military power, the leap is too often made
towards a full scale integrated European army. Indeed the Helsinki
proposals are in danger of trying to achieve this step, which remains
impossible unless the EU becomes a much more politically integrated
entity. In the near term (the next 5 years), it would be much more
productive to look for opportunities to rationalise forces in being
which can be operated more efficiently on a multilateral or EU-wide
basis. The model for such a supranational activity is the NATO AWACs
force, which has successfully provided an airborne early warning
capability to NATO members at much lower day-to-day operating cost
than would have been the case if operated on an individual national
basis.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	What capability does Europe need which it
could operate on a similar basis to NATO AWACS? Airlift is an obvious
example. If forces are to be deployed rapidly, they need to be able
to call on a significant airlift capability. In looking for an
opportunity for early rationalisation, we need to identify a
capability which is common to many EU members. The air tactical
transport role is a capability which most nations need, and many
provide for it at least partly using the C130 aircraft. Pooling of
some of these widely used C130 Hercules could provide an immediate
European tactical fixed wing transport  capability. Provided that
nations structured their contributions sensibly, they could make
operating cost savings at the national level through closure of
bases, training units, and headquarters. The level of saving would
depend on the degree to which each nation felt able to rely on the
supporting infrastructure being provided by a European
facility.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	 Some ten EU nations operate C130 aircraft
 . It would be possible to imagine a pooled fleet of 70 aircraft,
which would look after all the national  C130 needs of  Belgium (who
operate 11), Denmark (4), Italy (10), Netherlands (2), Spain (12),
Sweden (8)  and Portugal (6). France with 14  C130s and the UK with
55 have larger  transport aircraft fleets; and they could provide a
partial contribution  of perhaps 6 and 10 aircraft respectively to
the pooled arrangement. Greece (15  C130s) might choose not to depend
on pooled aircraft. For those nations that were prepared to put all
of their C130 fleets into a common pool, there would be significant
savings in operating costs. They would also have a much better
assurance of availability on a day to day basis, given the ability to
plan routine servicing across a larger fleet. For Europe there would
be a usable airlift capability for humanitarian operations as well as
for use within NATO. Nor would nations lose the option to withdraw
their airframes and aircrews if they felt the need for some national
purpose. The force would not be rendered useless if one or more
nations declined to take part in a particular operation for national
reasons. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	However, for lower costs to be achieved
this would have to be quite different from current on-call
multinational arrangements. The force would operate from a single
main base located centrally in Europe, but would have dispersed
flights to service national needs. There would be a single
headquarters, manned by personnel from the contributing EU nations.
Aircrew would be multinational and not tied to the airframes provided
by their nations. There would be a single planning, servicing and
logistics organisation to support the force. Most importantly, the
manpower, headquarters, infrastructure and other savings would have
to be realised in the military structures of the contributing
nations. Those resources could then be redeployed to updating and
enhancing other capabilities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Over time, the management and operation of
this common fleet would lead to a common perception among
participating nations of the characteristics of the next generation
transport aircraft. This would have great benefits in terms of
reducing duplication of defence research and procurement costs in
this particular area. The extra costs of operating on a national
basis rather than a pooled basis would also become clear, and it is
likely that nations would begin to see the advantages of contributing
to such a force element.  This would also increase the pressure for
common equipment procurement programmes for successor
aircraft.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	In a slightly longer timescale, the
requirement for a large strategic airlift capability could be
tackled. The operation of such a fleet could easily be managed by the
same organisation that would look after the tactical C130 pooled
capability. It would be possible to procure a new capability of C17s
or Antonov strategic transport aircraft that could either be operated
by the military or on a leased basis from a commercial company. In
either case the costs would be lower than each nation trying to
operate a very small fleet of large and expensive aircraft. </FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Air to air refuelling capability is also
needed by all European air forces, and would be a natural candidate
for a European fleet operation. There is consideration being given to
procuring the UK air to air refuelling capability through a public
private partnership arrangement. This would be particularly easy to
enlarge to encompass those nations in Europe which sought such a
facility. The economics of the operation would improve for the larger
fleet and there would be no sovereignty issues to worry about given
the service is being provided by the private sector.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	It is possible to draw up similar
proposals for transport helicopters, although care must be taken to
ensure that sufficient assets are based within easy flying range of
their normal tasking. This will tend to require dispersed deployments
and the efficiencies from pooling short range assets will therefore
be less.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Reconnaissance and Combat Search and
Rescue (CSAR) are two roles, which are expensive in equipment and
training, but which could offer opportunities for building up EU
capabilities to operate with the US forces available to NATO. There
will be considerable development in the use of UAVs for the tactical
reconnaissance role, and there is a need for a European
satellite-based strategic reconnaissance capability. Both of these
capabilities will be expensive, but are essential if Europe is
serious in its intention to provide real military capability. The
information exploitation organisation will again be much more
cost-effective if operated at the supranational level. This
capability needs to be considered in the context of an EU
intelligence capability, which given the political, military and
financial complexities is dealt with below as part of  medium term
integration.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	None of the air transport, air tanker,
reconnaissance or CSAR pooling  proposals would undermine national
capability. Indeed for the smaller nations it would both increase
available capability and reduce costs. It is thus possible to see
opportunities for enhancing the support element of air power in
Europe in a relatively  short timescale through aggressive
rationalisation of forces in being, and exploiting the moves towards
public-private partnerships. Significant defence funds would be
released provided that nations took the consequent manpower and
infrastructure savings which would flow. There would remain a problem
of the "free-rider" nation, although the audit and capability
criteria proposals of the Helsinki Summit may help to stimulate
contributions from EU member nations. At an early stage, it will be
necessary to establish a European Defence Budget to which members
contribute either capability or money.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Medium Term European Air Power
Integration</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	While the support area offers
opportunities for pooling and rationalisation of air power forces
without too many issues of national sovereignty, real increases in
capability will need a similar approach to combat air power. It is
unlikely that major EU defence players will be attracted to giving up
their combat capabilities to a supranational authority until some
confidence has been gained through the less contentious pooling of
air transport and air-to-air refuelling capability. . </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Offensive and defensive air power
capability  is politically the most difficult element to pool and
operate at the European level. Nations are prepared to make
arrangements for multinational forces, but insist on retaining the
ability to operate their forces nationally. The effect of this
approach was seen in the divergence of the national Tornado
enhancements over the past 20 years. The Tri-national training unit
was closed down in 1999 because the aircraft it operated were no
longer representative of each nation's own Tornados. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	 As soon as it became politically
acceptable, some of the existing common combat air equipment
capabilities   could be pooled in a similar manner to that described
for the C130 force. An obvious example would be an EU F16 force.
Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Netherlands and Portugal operate 424 F16s
between them. This could provide some  support for the new deployable
Helsinki agreed force.  Despite the divergence in Tornado IDS
updates, Germany, Italy and the UK could look at how pooled
arrangements might allow them to contribute some of their 570
aircraft to an early offensive capability to the Helsinki force. 
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The introduction into service of
Eurofighter from 2002 to five European nations (UK, Germany, Italy,
Spain and Greece) offers a  good opportunity to enhance capabilities
and reduce costs through pooling of  assets. Sharing training,
engineering, logistic, and operational planning facilities would
throw up significant operating cost savings. These would be greatly
increased if the number of  bases required could be reduced as a
result. Most importantly common fleet management would play a vital
role in retaining system configuration control so that all
Eurofighters remain fully interoperable. From a political viewpoint,
if as a result Europe were able to offer a force of 500  of the most
modern combat aircraft for future NATO operations, it would be a
capability contributor more equal to the United States in any Gulf or
Kosovo type operation. A pooled fleet would also ensure that a common
approach to weapons procurement was adopted. Indeed, it would become
an attractive club to join: other EU nations would calculate the
additional cost savings to be achieved by procuring Eurofighter as
their successor combat aircraft.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The development of an EU precision attack
capability would be a key part of this medium term plan. The
provision of adequate stocks of appropriate munitions would allow
nations to contribute in other ways than just aircraft and aircrew.
Starting the process early would allow a common view to emerge about
the platform/weapons combination which should be developed. Leaving
France, Germany, Italy and the UK to research their own future
offensive capability will inevitably result in a sub-optimal
solution. A united EU view on both the importance and the nature of
the next generation offensive air power requirement would be a very
powerful driver towards procuring an effective capability. There is
time for this process to begin, provided that nations start to
operate in this role together. Under the current arrangements, Europe
is likely to perpetuate the mix of sytems of limited effectiveness in
the offensive role.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	One of the more expensive air power
capabilities is provided by the aircraft carrier, which is examined
in Dr Goulter's chapter on expeditionary warfare. Few European
nations can afford to field such a force; for those which stay in the
role, the opportunity costs are very high. The UK plans to provide 2
carriers in 2012, and it likely that France, Spain and Italy will
wish to retain the role as well. Operated on a national level, one or
two carriers do not constitute a viable and reliable force, and the
opportunity costs are severe for other defence capabilities. The
timescale is sufficiently long for interested EU nations to look at
how they might jointly contribute to a force of 5 or 6 aircraft
carriers with their supporting ships and aircraft. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Intelligence requirements permeate every
aspect of military operations, and an independent Intelligence
capability will be needed if EU forces are to be able to operate
truly autonomously. Pooling of current intelligence related air power
capabilities will be difficult for a number of reasons. The equipment
used by nations is diverse, and much of it outdated; the national
exploitation is jealously guarded; and there are bilateral
difficulties with wider information sharing. For these reasons, it
would probably be more effective to build up a new EU intelligence
capability from scratch. This would be expensive, but would allow a
fully integrated modern system to be established relatively quickly.
If the EU wanted to focus on one area for priority action, then
Intelligence would provide it. The platforms, communication, fusion,
exploitation and dissemination systems could be built up to be fully
interoperable with NATO, but also independently usable. Kosovo showed
 that the inability to share digital intelligence data was a problem
throughout the operation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	In the much longer term, it is possible to
contemplate the gradual development of a European Air Force as 
experience of pooling forces is gained. Confidence would grow as to
the greater availability of air power assets to individual nations,
to the EU and to NATO. Such a force would be a part of a wider
integration of European defence capabilities, which would require the
development of a European defence budget. The mechanisms for
operating such a budget are beyond the scope of this chapter, but are
an essential part of moves towards more efficient use of European
defence resources.  Nations would still be able to retain independent
national air capabilities if they so wished, but such national air

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	There is a close parallel in these
proposals with the original evolution of independent national air
forces. Armies and navies wanted to own their own air power, and were
concerned about becoming too dependent on an independent air force,
which would be centrally controlled at the higher level. The costs,
confusion and inefficiencies of maintaining army and naval air forces
eventually led nations to form a third service which could procure
and use air power effectively.  The next stage for such sensible
rationalisation must be an integration of air power across national
boundaries. Those national boundaries may have had physical meaning
on the ground and at sea, but are irrelevant in the air.If the
political will were there, Europe could produce effective modern air
power, and could even do it more cost effectively than does the
United States.</FONT></P>
