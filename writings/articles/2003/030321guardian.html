			<p><font size="-1">Tens of thousands of US and British soldiers are poised to start the journey from Kuwait to Baghdad and beyond to the oilfields in the north of Iraq. In the original war plan, military commanders could have assumed that there would be a simultaneous thrust south from Turkey, but politics have eliminated that option. This complicates the operational planning to a great extent. Not only will the Kuwait assembly areas need to be protected even more as the single point of entry, but the logistics of such an extended line need very careful consideration.<br>
					<br>
					The focus of public attention tends to be on the high tech weaponry, and the leading combat units. Yet none of them will work unless their operators are fed and watered, and their equipment has enough fuel, lubricants and ammunition. Logistics often feel like the Cinderella part of military activity, but no soldier, sailor or airman can fight without a reliable logistics supply line. Pushing an armoured division forward over a long distance is a bit like trying to build a pyramid. You need a much larger base line to support the sharp point at the top. In the Falklands conflict twenty years ago, it took a cascade of 21 air-to-air refuelling aircraft to put one Vulcan bomber over Port Stanley and return it safely to Ascension Island.<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					The army talks of the importance of &quot;lines of communication&quot;. These are the arteries from which the fighting units draw their sustenance as they advance. In the days of the Cold War, the NATO forces in Germany did not envisage advancing much at all in the event of war. They could therefore ensure that their supplies were ready in position. In the last Gulf War, the ground advance was fast but lasted for only 100 hours and then stopped. Even then keeping the fuel tankers up with the frontline was demanding. This time we are considering the possibility of sustained high intensity fighting in Baghdad, with the main supply base in Kuwait. This will require fast work in setting up forward logistics areas along the route. These will need to be in secure areas, and that means more troops to guard fuel, ammunition, food and water storage dumps. The resupply routes will also need to be well protected. <br>
					<br>
					None of this is that difficult given sufficient time and enough troops. However, Shock and Awe is by design short of both. The aim is rapid advance, and the plan uses fewer troops than were felt necessary to deal with Kuwait a decade ago. Dealing with refugees and prisoners of war is another logistics problem which can eat up manpower. We can predict some difficult decisions for the commanders as they progress northwards. There will be a reluctance to stretch the lines of communication too far. To be separated from resupply, and run the risk of running out of fuel, ammunition or water is not wise. Yet if the advance is as easy as is hoped, there will be great pressure to get to Baghdad as soon as possible.<br>
					<br>
					To some extent tactical air transport and helicopters will be able to help in the forward area, but they are always in demand. In this war, they are likely to be allocated  primarily for troop transport to urgent tasks such as taking the oilfields and any known chemical weapon storage sites. The US hopes to be able to use airfields in the northern Kurdish enclave to provide access. Planners will worry about the security in this region given the mix of Turks, Iraqis and Kurds with odd insurgents.<br>
					<br>
					Months of detailed planning will have gone into making sure that the logistic supply plan can work. It will also have to take into account what happens if a key supply dump is lost to Iraqi or terrorist action. Sometimes the enthusiasts imagine that an army can advance at the speed of a fast armoured personnel carrier on the road. The reality is that any military formation travels at the speed of its slowest component if it wants to remain a fighting formation. It's no use arriving early if you are on your own out of fuel, out of ammunition and out of ideas. The arithmetic of logistic support over extended distances is sobering, and mitigates against the short war. Even President Bush seems to be realising that now.</font></p>
