<BLOCKQUOTE><ADDRESS>The day when two army corps can annihilate one
another in one second, all civilised nations, it is to be hoped, will
recoil from war and discharge their troops.</ADDRESS>

<P ALIGN=RIGHT>ALFRED NOBEL in 1892 (1)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The scale of destruction possible with nuclear weapons must exceed
the wildest speculations of Alfred Nobel, yet his hopes for the
resulting disarmament have not been fulfilled. Theories for the
effects of nuclear weapons on international relations have blossomed
in the past 38 years; and central to much of this 'deterrent theory'
is the horror which Nobel foresaw, when he was inaugurating the prize
for peace, and wished that he could 'invent a machine of such
frightful efficiency for wholesale destruction that wars should
thereby become altogether impossible'.(2)</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Deterrence theories have tried to do many things: to explain the
rationale for a current national posture; to predict the actions and
responses of states in peace, in crises, and in war; to suggest
strategies for the furtherance of foreign policy objectives; and to
suggest equipment procurement to improve force effectiveness, world
stability or national survivability. The major weakness of deterrence
theory is its lack of supporting experimental evidence. While much
may, and has been, inferred from international events which involve
nuclear weapon states, the evidence is rarely conclusive. Since 1945,
the key issue of when nuclear weapons would be used in anger has,
fortunately, never been put to the conclusive test. The nuclear
strategists in this period have developed intricate theories against
a backcloth of rapid but largely untested technological innovation.
Their ideas are important, not solely because of their validity or
otherwise, but also because of the influence that they may have had
on the shaping of national strategies. That world peace may depend on
a capability to exterminate, virtually instantaneously, a significant
portion of mankind is bizarre; yet the possible results of a nuclear
conflict make the need for maintaining peace, a matter of prime
importance.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The first part of this book looks at the theoretical concepts of
nuclear deterrence, and draws out the various schools of thought
which have emerged in the short period of the nuclear age. That some
theories contradict others, or result in quite opposite conclusions,
is not surprising given the inevitable subjectivity of any analysis
which depends on predicting human reactions to given circumstances.
Having examined the theory, the practice in each of the nuclear
weapon states is studied in the second part. We look at how and why
nuclear weapons were obtained by each state, and the rationale for
their possession today and for the future. Finally, having put the
theory in the context, those factors which bear upon the stability of
the system are considered.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The stability of the system must be the key area of concern for
strategists and decision-makers alike. It is no part of my intention
to provide Utopian solutions to the world's problems. The aim of this
book is to highlight those areas which have an influence on future
stability, are amenable to change, and for which there are incentives
to implement the necessary changes. Through such examination, not
only will the question of whether deterrence can last be answered,
but options for improving its robustness will be offered.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>As a serving officer in the Royal Air Force, I have had ample
opportunity to think about the practicality of nuclear deterrence,
particularly while flying Canberras in Germany and commanding a
Vulcan strategic bomber squadron. The research for this book is drawn
from a year spent at Magdalene College, Cambridge, working for an
MPhil degree in International Relations. The help of Dr Philip Towle,
at the University, was invaluable in bringing together my thoughts in
this volume. Those thoughts, however, do remain entirely my own and
do not necessarily reflect official opinion.</P>
