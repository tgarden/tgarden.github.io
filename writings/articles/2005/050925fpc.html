			<h4>Securing the Future: Peace and Security in the Middle East</h4>
		</div>
		<div align="left">
			<p><b>A Fringe meeting at the Labour Party Conference Brighton on 25 September 2005 for the Foreign Policy Centre</b></p>
			<p><i>This event hopes to highlight the recent developments in the Middle East that have occurred over the summer.&nbsp; This includes the EU3 failure to prevent Iran from restarting its nuclear facilities, the withdrawal of Syria from Lebanon, the presidential elections in Egypt, the drafting of the Iraqi Constitution, the escaltion of oil prices, not to mention the withdrawl of Israel from Gaza.&nbsp; In essence, the Global Fringe is hoping to stand back and take a look at the big picture of the region, rather than isolating the various events.&nbsp;</i></p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>We have 10 minutes each to point the way to solving the problems of Iraq, Iran, Israel-Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, Saudi and the rest of the greater Middle East. Trying to step back and produce the political scientist's equivalent of a unified field theory in Physics.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Yet, such a broad view is important. Grand Strategy seems to have gone out of fashion. Rolling news, front-line images, and short term politics have made us focus on the tactical. We respond to each event in the region without thinking like a chess player in terms of the consequences three moves on and in another area of the board. A topical example might is western democracies' concerns about terrorism, security of energy supplies and&nbsp; proliferation. The intervention in Iraq was seen by some as a way of improving the situation in all three areas. Yet because actions have consequences, the number of terrorists, and the global support for them, has increased. The greatest influx of outside fighters to join the insurgency has been from Algeria. And on security of oil supplies, the simplistic view that control of Iraq would bring a golden age of oil in friendly hands has proved illusory. Better intelligence would have revealed what the April 2005 International Energy Agency report shows that the state of the Iraqi oil fields is so bad that only 1.8 million barrels per day are being produced compared with 2.6 million in 2000. Oil available for export is falling.</p>
			<p>On dealing with proliferation, we have become more constrained. Iran was always more likely to be successful at producing a nuclear weapon capability than Iraq (assuming that it wanted to). We encouraged it to keep the option open, by siding with Saddam in the 80's during the devastating Iran-Iraq war. We then convinced ourselves and Iran that Iraq had WMD. Are we surprised that Iranian military planners want to go down that route? And at the same time, our need for a helpful Pakistan means that we must support a nuclear armed military dictatorship, which has acknowledged its own role in proliferation, and has mixed loyalties within its military in the area of Islamic extremism.</p>
			<p>The focus on Iranian nuclear enrichment is&nbsp; right if we are concerned about nuclear proliferation. Yet we know that Iran has the ability to make life much more difficult in Iraq. The threat of US or Israeli military action makes those in Iran, who advocate the final step towards a nuclear weapon capability, more powerful. Such military action would not stop development. Nor in the post Iraq world are US and UK publics likely to put up with a major military intervention. Yet a nuclear armed Iran would make Saudi Arabia consider its options in this field.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Proliferation in the region will scarcely comfort Israel, despite its own significant nuclear capability (thought by some to be bigger than the UK's). The&nbsp; pre-emptive attack on the Osirak reactor in 1981 is seen by many Israeli military planners as the template for future counter-proliferation.</p>
			<p>Indeed the answer that the political leaders of the democracies come up with too often to problems in the region&nbsp; is the early use of military force. This is in some respects surprising. With the move away from conscription, the armed forces are much smaller than in previous times. We have also happily moved to a time when military lives are less expendable, but that again constrains their utility. We also have built up in the post Cold War last 15 years a breadth of experience of the limitations of military force. But the great advantage to governments in the era of rolling news is that military action will be seen as firm response to crisis.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>In looking at this region of diverse but interrelated problems, one generalisation might be made: external military intervention will probably make the problem worse. That does not mean that there is never a case for the threat or use of military force. There may be instances when the absence of intervention can lead to an even worse situation. What we cannot expect is to grow democracy through imperialism (whether real or perceived). The US and its allies can win any firepower exchange with players in the region. Yet destroying Fallujah will not bring democracy to Iraq. Israeli aircraft bombing Gaza City today in revenge for Hamas mortars will not produce a friendly democratic Palestinian state to leave in peace with Israel. RAF Harriers and Dutch F16's bombing the hills of Afghanistan will not reduce the threat of terrorism in Europe or heroin on our streets.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Securing the future is much more difficult, and is a long term project. It is about economic development, education, human rights, the rule of law, and eventually democracy. There will often be setbacks, but the Grand Strategy needs to be in place. We must work with the grain of the people and cultures, not expect to be able to impose our vision of democracy in an instant at the end of a gun. For UK policy, this means much more effort in the conflict prevention area. Clare Short, when Secretary of State at DfID, had the right idea with pooled resources between MOD, FCO and her own department. This forced policy makers to look at how we could best help countries and people in the region. Sometimes this would be through training of aspiring politicians, or police and military. Elsewhere it might be educational projects for women. Bringing together neighbours in the region through common problems such as water access. None of these produces as good front page pictures as last Monday's British troops ablaze, but it has more chance of pushing the region in the right direction.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>We cannot do any of this alone. The EU is able to afford to do much in this respect, and is also sympathetic. We need to help where we can to develop regional co-operation in the area. The UN must be central to this work. However, in the end, whether the region descends into chaos or not will depend more on US actions than any other country. We do need to use whatever influence we have to get the US government to think more about the long term interests of the world rather than tomorrow morning's headlines. I am afraid that I am pessimistic.</p>
