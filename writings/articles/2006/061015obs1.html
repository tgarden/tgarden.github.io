			<h4>This crisis could change our relationship with US </h4>

			<p>I can think of only one recent occasion when we've had a situation similar to the one that arose last week. In the early Nineties, the then chief of the air staff, Sir Michael Graydon, made a speech in which he talked about politicians 'bathing in the reflected glory' of the armed forces while cutting their budgets. It received a lot of prominence and a couple of days later he made a formal apology.<br>
			</p>
			<p>Constitutionally, it is very difficult if it appears the military are going public and trying to talk over the heads of the elected government. But they have another responsibility - to the armed forces which have no trade union or form or representation. They are the focus for all the concerns their men and women have. They have to be seen to be leading their forces.<br>
			</p>
			<p>I agree with everything he said. That doesn't mean he should have said it and expected to stay in the post. If he believes the army is in danger he has a duty to alert the nation, but if the government disagreed with him he would have to be prepared to stand down. However, we've had a moderately happy outcome. What he said was right and an accommodation has been found in that the Prime Minister has backed him, so he doesn't have to resign.<br>
			</p>
			<p>I don't think he was naive. In an introductory interview, just after he took up the appointment, he used this phrase 'running hot' [to describe the army's overstretch] and that excited an awful lot of comment. He knew people listened to what he said. He probably went in to the interview knowing he might have to resign. He's a man of integrity, so I rather assume he knew the risks he was taking when he did it.<br>
				When Geoff Hoon was defence secretary, there was a real clampdown in terms of the military speaking to journalists. Even if they were going to speak at old boys' reunions they had to clear what they said. Hoon ran a very tight ship, even in off-the-record briefings.<br>
			</p>
			<p>I've noticed quite a dramatic change in the last few months, presumably coinciding with the arrival of Des Browne, the new defence secretary. It's not just the chief of the general staff doing newspaper interviews. Recently we've seen the chief of the defence staff, Sir Jock Stirrup, on the Today programme, and the chief of the air staff, Sir Glenn Torpy, on Newsnight. These are serving officers who, it appears, are being asked to speak to journalists instead of ministers.<br>
			</p>
			<p>I don't doubt there has been an assessment that the public trusts someone in uniform not to be spinning. But the downside of that, from a political point of view, is the very fact that they're not spinning. If asked a question they will give an answer. If you put senior officers in the position of defending government policy, which seems to be happening, then you run risks that you will get problems and also compromise the relationship between the senior military and their political masters. I imagine there will be a tightening up as a result of this. They've tried an experiment, seeing how it is to put men in the firing lines of Jeremy Paxman and John Humphrys, and found it was not entirely wise.<br>
			</p>
			<p>Will this have a good outcome in terms of policy? Most certainly. We have been drifting in Iraq; the government just wants to talk about Afghanistan. In effect government policy is 'we'll wait until America tells us what to do'.<br>
			</p>
			<p>I think he's opened up this debate by saying that we may be doing more harm than good. We may need to change our view about sustaining troops in Iraq. This could have a massive effect on global politics because it could alter our relationship with the US.<br>
