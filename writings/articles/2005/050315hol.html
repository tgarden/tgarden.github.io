			<p>Debate: The Lord Garden&#151;To call attention to the economic, political and security developments in Iraq since the intervention in 2003 by United Kingdom armed forces; and to move for papers.</p>
			<p>My Lords, this weekend it will be 2 years since the United Kingdom joined with the United States, Australia and Poland in a large scale military intervention in Iraq. Ignoring the question of legality or legitimacy,&nbsp; the coalition powers&nbsp; after the short war were in an extraordinarily strong position to help build a new democratic, economically strong, stable Iraq. Unfortunately, the speed and efficiency of the combat phase of the operation has not been replicated over the past two years in the reconstruction phase.</p>
			<p>My Lords, I have not called for this debate in order to repeat the concerns that many of us have over the process by which we went to war in Iraq. Nor do I want to spend time attributing blame for mistakes made in the planning - or lack of it- for the aftermath. Rather, I hope that we can review progress in the economic, political and security aspects with a view to tackling the challenges ahead.</p>
			<p>One of the difficulties that those of us who study these matters have is the lack of usable objective data. It is particularly difficult to plot trends in the economy, quality of life or physical security when different baselines and indicators are continually used. The assessment which I shall make can be no more than a distillation of many sources, and I shall be interested to see how far it accords with Government assessments.&nbsp; The debate is about three inter-related aspects. Economic development is urgently needed, but requires better security and a stable prospect for governance.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>Economy</h3>
			<p>Lack of progress in infrastructure projects can contribute to lawlessness and Insurgency. We are now 2 years on from the intervention, and yet it appears that electricity in some urban areas remains as unreliable now as it was then. The measures of progress in improving fresh water supply, sanitation, transport, functioning health and education facilities are unclear.</p>
			<p>Of the population of 26 million, around 8 million should be in employment, but unemployment is running somewhere between 30 and 40%.&nbsp; We still have&nbsp; an aid program based largely on American decisions and this means foreign contractors with&nbsp; much of the money going to non-Iraqis. Maladministration, not to say corruption, is a further worry, with the US Office of the Special Inspector-General for Iraq Reconstruction reporting at the end of January that $8.8 billion of Iraqi funds handed out by US administrators to Iraqi ministries was &quot;unaccounted for&quot;. On top of this, the security situation is diverting too much of the effort away from infrastructure work. Only $2.5 billion out of $18.4 billion of 2004 US aid was used. Recent reports suggest that the number of Iraqis employed on these projects is actually falling.</p>
			<p>What is&nbsp; the British government doing to get Iraqis involved in rebuilding their country, both to ensure that the individual Iraqi citizens can see that things are getting better month by month, and also to ensure that unemployed young men do not turn to crime and terrorism in even greater numbers? Can the Minister tell us about the proposals for a conference later this year?</p>
			<p></p>
			<h3>Political</h3>
			<p>I will now turn to political developments. We all welcomed the impressive turnout for the elections in January. Many brave Iraqis ignored threats in order to cast their votes. However, the euphoria over this excellent exercise in democracy should not obscure the very real political challenges that still lie ahead.</p>
			<p>The 275-member National Assembly is charged with drafting the country's new constitution, as well as choosing a president and two deputies from among its members. Those three leaders will then nominate a prime minister who will go before the assembly for approval. Today the Parliament meets for the first time, but it has to be for ceremonial purposes only, as the agreement between the main groupings (the United Iraqi Alliance, the Kurdish Alliance and the Iraqi List) has not yet been reached. We keep being told it is close.</p>
			<p>An agreement on the key cabinet posts must be reached before the new government can be named, and it has taken 6 weeks from the 30 January election to make this much progress. Another clock is also running for the political process. The new constitution needs to be agreed by 15 August to make the plebiscite deadline of 15 October, although it can be delayed once for up to 6 months. This is an extraordinarily challenging timetable, particularly given the real differences of views between different groups. Keeping the Kurds aboard during this process may be difficult. It will not be easy to agree what status should be accorded to Islam in the constitution. Also there will be difficulties over their desire to include Kirkuk, with its oil, in the Kurdish-controlled area, as well as demands that the region&rsquo;s autonomous status should be laid down in the constitution.</p>
			<p>If running the country and formulating a consensus over the new constitution were not enough, the full democratic elections under the new constitution are due by the end of the year. These are all positive moves that we should welcome, but they do carry with them turbulent times as Ministers change, and predicting the future&nbsp; governance is so difficult for those inside the country as well of those who might invest from outside.</p>
			<p>While the process may need more time than currently allowed, keeping the momentum is important, particularly to reduce the dangers of turbulence in these transitional periods. Does the British Government still feel the timetable is achievable, and&nbsp; what help can we give to achieve it?</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>Security&nbsp;</h3>
			<p>I come now to the security situation. This is perhaps the most difficult area to make objective assessments.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>I was struck by this difficulty when I received a phone call from Baghdad&nbsp; two weeks ago from an American journalist, who asked me for my assessment of the security situation in Iraq. I said that I thought she must be better placed than me to make such an assessment. She explained that it was almost impossible to leave her hotel, and, when she did, she could not speak because her American accent made her an instant target. &nbsp;</p>
			<p>Another journalist, a regular visitor to Iraq, told me last week that he finds his most reliable sources are Iraqi lorry drivers, who have to negotiate their way through insurgents, bandits and criminals. He was dismissive of the multinational force intelligence &#150; bunkered in the Green Zone. As he said, they cannot even secure the road from the airport to the town.</p>
			<p>My sources thus are journalists, academics who interview Iraqis, the Pentagon (which is so much freer with information than our own MOD) and the hearings in the US. The picture that is painted is not a totally encouraging one, despite reassurances by Mr Hoon in the other place on Monday during defence questions.&nbsp; Let me start with the threat assessment. I draw heavily on the work of Professor Anthony Cordesmann of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. His interviews with Iraqi intelligence officers, and data from the Pentagon and the multinational force headquarters identifies four main threat sources:</p>
			<p></p>
			<ul>
				<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Zarqawi and Outside Islamist Extremist Organization Fighters:</i> Mostly foreign Arab and from other countries. Their numbers are small and probably well under 1,000, but their methods of attack have great impact.
				<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Former Regime Elements (FRE)s:</i> A mix of true supporters of the Ba&rsquo;ath, alienated Sunnis, paid volunteers, temporary recruits, and other Iraqis. Some estimate these as between 15,000 and 30,000 fighters.
				<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Iraqi Native Islamist Extremist Organization Fighters are a </i>small (perhaps fewer than 500) but&nbsp; growing threat.
				<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Organized Crime is </i>the major source of violence and insecurity in at least 12 of the 18 governorates. They often seem to cooperate with terrorists and insurgents. Numbers are very high, and the effect on the overall security situation is also high.&nbsp;
			</ul>
			<p>The question we must answer is whether our current approach is dealing with and reducing these threats, or whether they are still increasing. Following the daily fluctuations through media reports is particularly difficult as the threshold for reporting has steadily increased. These days a bomb outrage with more than 100 dead makes the front pages; those with 25 may make a few column inches in the inside pages. The many individual deaths, hostage taking, armed crimes and extortion do not hit the news unless one of our own citizens is involved. The Pentagon e-mails me every day the reports of deaths of US servicemen, and that gives some sense of the high level of violence across their area of responsibility. Sadly there continue to be such reports every day, and as we know the total passed through the 1500 killed milestone recently. I have through questions in your Lordships House tried to discover some consistent measure of Iraqi casualties over time. We need to know how many Iraqis are being killed and injured, where it happens, and who is likely to be responsible. How can we judge our strategy without collation of this data? As the editorial in last week's British Medical Journal said:</p>
			<p>&quot;Counting casualties accurately can help to save lives both currently and in the future. Understanding the burden of death, injury, disease, and trauma that the population is currently suffering enables proper planning of war, and health, and in assessing local responses appropriately. In the future this should help government and military planners to assess the likely humanitarian implications of conflict.&quot;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;I urge that the Government to look again at its counter-productive policy of not collecting and collating such data.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Our armed forces, and those of our allies, serving in Iraq have a difficult and challenging problem. I think there is widespread agreement that the only way forward is to provide the training and equipment necessary for Iraqi security forces progressively to take over the responsibility for national security. The question is how to keep that process on track, while the trainees themselves have become ever more targeted.&nbsp; Iraqi officials and officers readily acknowledge that Iraqi forces still have a long way to go, that they still lack proper training and equipment, and that transition to two new Iraqi governments in 2005 will create turbulence under the best of circumstances. They made it clear that they cannot predict how the new government would behave or how the constitutional process and efforts at inclusion would change Iraqi security policy. They acknowledge the limits to their ability to plan and manage Iraq&rsquo;s force development in any orderly way. Even if the course of the insurgency were predictable, Iraqi military and security developments are very much a matter of improvisation and uncertainty. Iraqi officials and officers also have no clear budget for force planning, and no way to predict the level of US and other MNC aid.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Some of the Iraqi officials interviewed by Cordesmann are reported as saying&nbsp; that three changes were needed:</p>
			<ul type="disc">
				<li>First, to develop and implement plans to create Iraqi forces more quickly that are equipped and deployed to stand on their own.
				<li>Second, to develop common plans with the US and MNC to phase down the role of MNC forces according to common criteria and in ways where both sides have the same expectations, allowing Iraqis to predict the future level of MNC aid and remaining capability.
				<li>Third, to develop mid-term plans to create forces with enough support and heavy land and air weapons to eventually replace all MNC forces other than those remaining in an advisory and training role.
			</ul>
			<p>Does the British Government recognise this as a possible way forward? If so are discussions between MNC members aimed at co-ordinating this approach, and does the noble Baroness, the Minister, agree that more specific timetabling, with targets and milestones, for the build up of trained Iraqi forces and parallel reductions in MNC forces, would generate a more focused strategy? If she does not, then what is the strategy? This approach is now even more urgent after Italy, which has been a significant force contributor, has decided to draw down its forces through the year.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>My Lords, I began by explaining that I hoped that this debate would be an opportunity to share our expertise and look for a way forward in Iraq. We have to help in whatever way we can to make it a stable country. Not just because as a nation, we were deeply complicit in setting these events in motion, but because growing instability and terrorism there will affect the region and even increase terrorist threats closer to home. The reports that Saddam's nuclear facilities were professionally stripped during the period of anarchy in April 2003 are particularly worrying.</p>
			<p>There are many challenges, and I have attempted to outline some of them. Some are beyond the UK's ability to influence or affect. We will need to work with other MNC contributors, particularly the US, and increasingly in a supportive role to the emerging Iraqi government. We do have some levers though, which we must use carefully. In concert with allies and the Iraqis, we need to look at how we can progressively reduce our military presence on the ground while not letting civil disorder make a step change for the worse. This means investing much in both rebuilding the infrastructure and offering training and equipment to the Iraqis in all aspects of nation building including security. We have little time. If we fail, it will be much more costly in the long term.</p>
