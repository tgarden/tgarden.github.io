			<h4><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Transforming Times</font></h4>
			<font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">At one level, Lord Robertson, the NATO Secretary General, should be celebrating his achievements after 3 years as the front man for the Alliance. It has been an extraordinary period of strategic change in the world, and there are plenty of successes to toast over this volatile period. Yet the trends for NATO are not encouraging. At the end of the Cold War, it managed to find a role as Yugolsavia disintegrated. Developing new capabilities and doctrines, the Alliance, that had deterred an East-West nuclear war for half a century, transformed itself into an effective peacemaking and stabilising force. New relationships with old enemies through Partnership for Peace have done much to improve European security. As the Balkans played out, NATO even found itself running a shooting war for the first time in 1999 in Kosovo. Yet the success of the Kosovo air campaign was a salutary reminder that its real effective military might depended almost totally on US contributions. <br>
				<br>
				After the terror attacks of 11 September 2001, NATO moved faster than anyone expected with its first historic  declaration under Article 5. This centrepiece of its founding treaty was designed to ensure that all members of the Alliance would come to the help of any member who might be attacked. The drafters in 1949 are unlikely to have had an international terrorist attack on the mainland of the United States in mind when they put the treaty together. But Washington was slow to take up the offer of help. Experience during the Kosovo crisis, and frustration at the need to achieve consensus among the other 18 members has coloured the views of the Bush Administration. Perhaps no American President could have contemplated giving NATO a leading role  after such an attack. In the event, NATO sent its airborne early warning force to help defend American airspace while the real  battle moved to Afghanistan. <br>
				<br>
				A number of European nations have played a significant role in Afghanistan and continue to do so today. They may use NATO procedures, but they are there through bilateral arrangements with the USA. Nowhere is there a NATO flag to be seen. Few who study Alliance arrangements are surprised, and some would say that Kosovo will prove to be NATO's first and last war.<br>
				<br>
				The last great NATO summit was held in Washington in April 1999 right  in the middle of the Kosovo air campaign. The next is due to be in Prague at the end of November this year. It will  again be overshadowed by the prospect of another war: this time in Iraq. At the Washington summit 3 years ago, NATO had a direct interest in the management of the Kosovo war. This time, it will be a spectator as the Iraq situation develops. Does this mean NATO is now irrelevant?</font>
			<h4><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The Prague Agenda</font></h4>
			<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The agenda for Prague is daunting. In 1999, NATO took in 3 new members (Poland Hungary and the Czech Republic) after much soul-searching. At Prague they  will consider the case of  9 applicants (Albania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia). The hot money is on seven being given the green light. There are new much closer arrangements with Russia, and even the Ukraine is asking to be considered for membership. <br>
					<br>
					At the Washington summit, members signed up to a daunting list of promises to improve their military capabilities under the rubric of the Defence Capabilities Initiative (DCI). Some 58 weaknessess were to be corrected. Unsurprisingly, little was done subsequently. The Europeans continued to spend their budgets on every public service except defence. In Prague, they will focus on some key capabilities in the DCI list. But the USA has moved on. It is  now spending over twice as much on defence as all of the Europeans put together, and is using the money to transform the way it fights. How can the European members of NATO hope to keep up? <br>
					<br>
					New imaginative schemes will be put on the table at Prague. The latest idea from the Bush Administration is a proposal for a new quick reaction NATO Response Force (NRF). This would provide two brigades instantly available at very short notice to deploy globally with air and naval support. It might allow NATO to take an airfield in some emergency. Countries would provide a brigade for 6 months training followed by another 6 months on standby. The hope is that having elite forces working at the high end of the spectrum of warfare would in time trickle down the US technology and methods to the remainder of European standing forces. The NRF is a very modest proposal which is not timed to be operational until 2006, and yet there is little expectation that NATO will rise to this new challenge. Even if it does, there seems little hope that such a deployable force will have the desired effect on the rest of Europe's now largely obsolescent military capabilities.</font></p>
			<h4><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Deterrence, Pre-emption or Nation Building?</font></h4>
			<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The US will also be trying to change the focus of NATO.  The War on Terrorism  remains the priority for American planning. The new US national security strategy document, published in September 2002, expresses concern about the future effectiveness of deterrence, and offers the option of pre-emptive action. NATO was for all of the Cold War  about deterrence, and its structures still reflect that philosophy. There will therefore  be a push for new structures as well as new capabilities. <br>
					<br>
					Does all of this mean that NATO is in its final days; and that failure at Prague will spell the end of the Alliance?  Almost certainly not. There is no lack of business for NATO. The peacekeeping task in the Balkans remains important. Eventually many hope that it will be possible for the EU to take over. Problems between Greece and Turkey continue to make this problematic, but eventually the Balkans must become an EU responsibility. Already  some are exploring  a role for NATO in the nation building phase of the Afghanistan operation. It  has become progressively more difficult to find nations to take the lead in the very limited Kabul stabilisation force (ISAF). Yet it is clear that a much larger scale peacekeeping operation is required throughout Afghanistan. Turkey is expected to hand over to a German/Netherlands led ISAF early next year. NATO might well find itself taking a lead by the middle of 2003. <br>
					<br>
					NATO also has an important and continuing role in making ad hoc coalitions possible. If the US is to be able to cobble together military formations from allies, they need to be able to talk the same military language. NATO provides the common doctrine and standards. It will be a hard job to continue this role as Europe continues to be stuck in the technology of the 20th Century, and America hopes to be able to leap to the 22nd Century with one bound. NATO can act as the agent for trying to keep the capabilities on both sides of the Atlantic compatible.</font></p>
			<h4><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">NATO and Iraq</font></h4>
			<p><font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">If military operations are launched against Iraq, there will be no NATO flag. The US may keep its allies informed on what it is doing, but will not allow them to constrain operations. Some NATO members, such as the UK, may have contributions to make, but they will be done on a bi-lateral national basis. If  a major military operation is mounted, then NATO may find it has a role once the shooting stops. When the nation building phase is begun, there will doubtless be plenty of encouragement for NATO to take on a yet larger peacekeeping role. This is yet another cause for debate within the Alliance, which begins to see itself cast in the role of the dustcart in the Lord Mayor's show.<br>
