<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Why Care about the future of
NATO?</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">I seem to have spent the last two
years going to a succession of conferences, workshops and seminars
addressing the problems of European Security in general and the
future of NATO in particular. This could at one level seem rather
curious. With the end of the Cold War and the rapid move towards
democratic government and market economies throughout central and
eastern Europe, one ought to be able say that the prospects for a
stable European continent have never been better. Certainly there is
for once no immediate threat of war across the continent - and that
is an unusual state. In the past, Europe has been a source of both
instability and conflict. The two most destructive prolonged and
geographically extended wars of this Century began in the centre of
Europe, as you in Australia know only too well. The post-War peace in
Europe was bought only at the price of the continuous threat of a
possible third even more destructive war. &nbsp; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">By the end of the Cold War, part
of Western Europe had made considerable progress, along a route of
economic interdependence, towards making armed conflict unthinkable
between fellow members of the European Union. The Common Market was
an excellent example of an institution which has been a successful
conflict prevention mechanism. The development of common economic
interests, with a system of rules and laws common to member nations,
has led to an entity, within which war has been relegated to the near
impossible. This process continues as the EU develops, and as it
looks at its scope for a common European security identity. In
parallel, the success of NATO since its foundation has been not just
in its role as a collective security alliance, but also as a
mechanism for building confidence between members and preventing
conflicts between members. &nbsp; </FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Concerns in the Transition
Period</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">So why is there so much angst
recently about future European security? Despite the end of the years
of nuclear confrontation, and the absence of any significant feeling
of military threat in Western Europe, it is clear that we are in the
midst of a transition period, when decisions are being made that will
profoundly affect the future of not just European security, but have
long-term world-wide repercussions. The two parallel, but distinct,
activities which are coming to a head are the changes in NATO and for
the European Union. July this year saw the decision in Madrid by NATO
on how to take forward the enlargement process, and also this year
the EU, at Amsterdam, has made some progress on its approach both to
extended membership, but rather less on its defence policy. </FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">There have been, and there are,
other organisations which have an impact on European security, but
the contribution that the EU and NATO have made to the elimination of
conflict between member states is of a different order. For this
reason, when looking to European security issues of the future, it is
these two organisation which are the starting point. Future security
predictions can only be made in the context of assumptions about the
way in which both NATO and the EU are likely to develop. </FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">What are the Security
Problems?</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">There are a number of current and
future security concerns for Europe. All States have a concept that
they define as their vital national interest. This will certainly
include the survival of the State itself, but will also include the
preservation of its territorial integrity and the defence of its
airspace and surrounding waters. This is familiar to you in Australia
as the rationale for your own defence forces, although no immediate
threat is apparent. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">European states will continue to
examine whether there is any potential external threat to their
individual vital interests. The mechanism for defining a European
collective vital interest is not yet properly developed, but this
might be expected to emerge in the coming years. Many in Western
Europe will take the view that there is no such threat at present,
but that there may be future potential problems. The future of Russia
will be a major factor in this analysis. While Russia now has neither
the capability (with the exception of nuclear forces) or inclination
to pose a direct threat to Western European nations, it is still of
concern to its nearer neighbours, and could remilitarise to pose a
wider threat in the future under certain circumstances. The future of
China is also a factor in the longer term. Some other countries,
which are potentially hostile to western liberal democracies, may be
developing a strategic delivery capability, which could provide the
threat of attack using weapons of mass destruction.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Russia is not the only possible
source of concern for territorial integrity. Pressures of population
and economic need, particularly from the North African states, may
lead to mass migration northwards to European States. This is a
different form of invasion from the use of armed forces, but is a
potential source of conflict. The Middle East remains a source of
potential conflict.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Territorial disputes remain, and
are likely to become more intense as environmental pressures
increase. Water, fishing and minerals can all lead to conflict. The
geography of Europe offers many opportunities for experts in
international law to earn their money in boundary disputes. In
particular Turkey and Greece have shown continuing hostility over
territorial limits around the many islands in their neighbouring
coasts. There is also the continuing problem over the partition of
Cyprus.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Ethnic disputes are not new to
Europe, but the growing acceptance by the international community of
a philosophy of ethnic self-determination is a potential cause for
much new disputation. The experience gained in the break up of
Yugoslavia has shown that the strength of feeling among ethnic groups
can still lead to conflict which cannot be ignored by neighbouring
states. If this presages a development towards more of Europe's
ethnic groups seeking realignment of national boundaries, and
fragmentation of states, there will be no lack of potential causes
for conflict. Such bids for ethnic self-determination can be a threat
to the survival of the state. However as the division of
Czechoslovakia has shown, it is possible for states to divide without
conflict.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">A key security issue that is
directly relevant to Europe's interests is the future relationship
with the United States. For the post-War period, Western Europe has
depended greatly on the direct involvement of the United States in
its security. That involvement has been guaranteed through NATO. With
the demise of the Soviet Union, the United States has taken on the
role of world policeman, even if it has at times been reluctant to do
so. As economic competition becomes greater, the world seems to be
forming into three competing regions: NAFTA, EU and ASEAN. If this
regionalisation of economic competition leads to trade wars, then it
is likely that the United States will be less willing to provide
costly support for European security. This will have a direct affect
on the security of European states.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Internal National Security
Concerns</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">In addition to the vital interests
of European states, there will continue to be a range of national
security concerns to be taken into account. They will be different
for each nation, and even when they overlap, they may be accorded
different priorities. For example, in the UK terrorism stemming from
the Northern Ireland problem remains a major national security
concern. Spain has a terrorist problem as well, and all states can be
at risk from both internal and external terrorist activity.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">The counter-terrorist requirements
can absorb a considerable proportion of a nation's defence resources.
In Northern Ireland, a fifth of the British Army are in place at any
given time, and the need for roulement of troops involves all of the
army. In this respect a national terrorism problem can have an
indirect effect on a nation's ability to contribute to wider European
security. For the future, there are concerns within the international
community that extremist terrorist organisations may gain access to
chemical, biological or nuclear weapons which would have profound
implications on security.&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">The world-wide drug trade is a
security issue, which is not a directly military threat. It carries
with both corruption and criminality cultures, which can be difficult
to eradicate. They can lead to a breakdown in the rule of law, and
put at risk democratic government. In all these policing fields there
are significant long term national security problems for an
increasing number of nations.&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Intelligence operations did not
cease with the end of the Cold War. With the dependence on
technological developments for economic success, some states and
companies will use espionage techniques which have security
implications. In particular, the massive increase in the use of
networked computer systems for data storage has opened up new
vulnerabilities. As economies become even more dependent on computer
systems, states will need to pay attention to potential information
system threats.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">What is NATO's Role?</FONT></B>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">As I travel round Europe and the
United States, the question that come up every time is what relevance
NATO has now, and what is its role with no Warsaw pact as a threat.
All the current member states, and certainly all the aspirant members
continue to see the major benefit of membership as an insurance
policy to provide defence of vital national interests at a lower cost
through a collective security arrangement. In this sense, the lack of
an obvious threat is unimportant. Just as Australia continues to
provide defence forces, as does every significant state, so the NATO
members share the risks and benefits of committing themselves to the
defence of each other. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">NATO also continues to act as a
conflict prevention organisation within its membership. There is a
transparency of information, and a will to settle potential causes of
tension. It continues to keep the Greeks and Turks just about from
each others throats. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">On top of these direct security
benefits, it is proving more and more valuable as a mechanism for the
training, standardisation and development of procedures for armed
forces who find themselves operating together under UN auspices. This
very great benefit should not be underestimated. If NATO did not
exist we would need to set up some sort of alternative mechanism for
allowing multinational forces to operate together effectively.</FONT>
</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Why should NATO
enlarge?</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Even if one accepts a continuing
need for an alliance when the threat has disappeared, many experts
are uncomfortable with the thought of it enlarging. They see this as
having a number of problems. Decision making on a consensus basis had
not always been easy between the 16 members, even with a single view
of the security threat. Any increase in membership, at a time of more
diffuse purpose, would compound this difficulty. In addition most
European nations are in the process of significantly reducing the
resources devoted to defence. Any new members of NATO would therefore
be welcomed only if they could participate on an equal footing. There
seemed little enthusiasm among the current NATO members for
increasing their defence obligations in order to provide protection
for new members. A diluted NATO, coupled with a lack of obvious
threat, might lead to the demise of the organisation. For many
however, the major problem is how to manage any expansion of NATO
without risking a return to a confrontational and divided Europe.
Expanding NATO would be a cause for concern to the nations which were
not brought into the collective security arrangement. In particular
Russia could feel threatened by its former adversary expanding and
coming closer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">The alternative is to leave NATO
as it is at 16 nations with arrangements to cooperate will the
Central and Eastern European states including Russia and the Ukraine.
This co-operation through the PfP process has already advanced the
moves to democracy greatly in a number of the countries. However,
their enthusiastic involvement has been with the assurance that
membership would ultimately be on offer. In any event, can it be a
sensible policy for the newly free states of Europe to be denied
membership of the co-operative security organisation which their
western neighbours enjoy as a way of providing security at lower
cost. Finally, membership of NATO prevents disputes between
neighbouring members, and this is important as the newly free states
develop.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">How will NATO develop to meet
security needs?</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">After considerable debate, some
fairly heated, the NATO Summit at Madrid in July set the organisation
off on its path to enlargement. The US, which had been at the
forefront of the pressure for enlargement, pushed for just 3 new
member states (Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic). Some European
states, and in particular France, were looking for Slovenia and
Romania to be added to the list. The US, supported by the UK, got its
way given that NATO requires unanimous decisions. The three states
are now possible new members for NATO's 50th birthday in 1999. There
are a number of hurdles still to be crossed. Each of the 16 current
members must ratify the change to the treaty. The US may find this a
difficult process, particularly over the question of costs, but
doubtless a solution will be found. Turkey seemed to be a potential
difficulty when it tried to couple agreement to its own bid for EU
membership. Nevertheless, it is likely the new members will raise
their flags in 1999. At that stage, there will be an expectation that
the next tranche of members will be announced.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">The biggest problem of course is
the question of how to handle the countries which are not in that
first tranche, and especially Russia. There is considerable concern
that if this part of the process is mishandled, we could see Europe
divided again. There does not seem to be a consistent view from those
in Russia on what arrangement they might be satisfied with. Nor is
the hope in some European capitals that, since NATO is self evidently
not an aggressive organisation, the Russians will understand that an
enlarged NATO is a good thing. The negotiation of a special
relationship between Russia and NATO, with the Founding Act, was a
triumph of diplomacy. It has yet to be seen whether the Russians are
prepared to use the Act as a vehicle for cooperation and benefit to
them, or as a way of obstructing further development of NATO.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">The Ukraine is in a different
position, and seems to have difficulty in deciding where its best
interests lie. Its special position has also been recognised in a
separate NATO-Ukraine arrangement. &nbsp; More problematic are the
central European nations that were not included in the first
invitation, the Baltic States, Romania and Bulgaria, Slovakia,
Albania and the successor states in the former Yugoslavia. All these
need to be brought closely into the European fold. It may be that the
commitment for future enlargement coupled with a deepening of PfP to
keep them interested will be enough. It will be a difficult
diplomatic trick to turn. &nbsp; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">So the choice of approach, the
achieving consensus of current states (and that becomes a greater
problem in an enlarged NATO), and the handling of those left out,
especially Russia and the Ukraine, are some of the problems. There
are others: resources for the enlargement, resources to keep NATO as
a real military force, the role of NATO, internal disputes between
members (particularly Greece and Turkey and the question of Cyprus),
the push by some for greater European command authority and the
management of relations with the EU if a common foreign and security
policy becomes more developed. Time will not allow me to develop the
role of the WEU in all this, except to say that it seems sensible to
continue to insist that the WEU full members must be both members of
the EU and of NATO. However, if that does remain the practice, there
will be some difficulties if EU and NATO enlargement diverge in terms
of countries. &nbsp; </FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">How will EU develop to meet
security needs?</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Let me turn then to the other side
of this security coin. As I said the European Union in its various
stages of development has acted as a stabilising force. It has of
course recently enlarged to take in the 17 million people of East
Germany with German Unification. The economic burden of this
relatively small expansion has brought home, particularly to Germany,
the costs of the process and the need for clear criteria for new
members. To many it has looked as though the EU is moving
deliberately slowly. The cynic might say that NATO enlargement can be
made as a political decision and the problems solved afterwards,
whereas EU enlargement is an economic decision which will have a
direct effect on the wealth of the current members. The EU has moved
with great care towards wider association agreements with prospective
new members. Negotiations about the fine detail of each market sector
have taken a long time both to hammer out. The first of the
non-members to apply back in 1987, Turkey, still is without any date
for prospective membership - hence its possible use of its NATO veto
as a lever. It took from 1990 to 1995 for the EU to move to a
position where it has started to give a tentative timetable. The
criteria for entry (the so-called Copenhagen criteria) require a
functioning market economy which can cope with the competitive
pressure inside the Union. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">On 16 July this year, in the
aftermath of Amsterdam, Jacques Santer presented Agenda 2000, which
takes this process forward significantly. It recommends that
accession negotiations start with Hungary, Poland, Estonia, the Czech
Republic and Slovenia. Negotiations will open at the same time as
with Cyprus in 1998. The first accessions are predicted to be
possible by 2001, although 2003 is seen as more likely. Bulgaria,
Romania, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia are invited into partnerships
to speed up their preparations for membership.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">The interaction between EU and
NATO enlargement </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">What does all this mean for future
European security. We have a headlong rush towards a limited but
important expansion of NATO by 1999, and uncertainties how to handle
the remainder of Europe in a NATO context beyond that. At the same
time the EU is progressing more slowly, and in a more detailed
negotiating fashion towards an orderly enlargement of its economic
community. Membership of the EU may not overtly confer a security
guarantee on member nations, but it certainly provides an implicit
guarantee. It is inconceivable that EU nations would stand aside if
one of their number came under external attack. Into this unclear
future, we must also add the uncertain developments down the road to
common foreign and security policy for Europe, and how it will relate
to the WEU and NATO. In addition the pressures for a move to a single
currency may result in a two tier community within the Union, and
this would have very uncertain results for the future of the EU.
Behind both NATO and EU enlargement there is also the question of
costs. As nations run down their national defence assets, they are
showing little sign of being prepared to pay for the NATO transition
costs. Similarly, semi- stagnant European economies in recent years
have delayed the provision of the funds to accelerate the
transformation of the Central and Eastern European economies. &nbsp;
</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">The United States &amp;
European Security</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Finally what does this uncertain
picture mean for the United States and its relations with Europe?
There is no doubt that uppermost in the consideration of the current
European members of NATO is the importance of keeping the
organisation relevant to provide the key linkage with the US. This is
not to suggest that there are not variations between States. The
attempts to reintegrate France in the military structure has been at
the price of opening up debates about the need for more European
representation at the higher command levels. Nevertheless in managing
the transition, one of the aims will be to keep the US both
interested and involved in NATO. A mature European Union expanded to
25 or more countries perhaps towards the end of the next decade,
would have twice the population of the United States. On current
figures its combined GDP would already be a fifth greater than that
of the US, and of course for many of the states they would expect to
have a rapid growth ahead until they caught up with their western
European neighbours. This would make Europe relatively even richer.
It seems unlikely that under such circumstances, a stable and secure
Europe, rich and populous, that US would wish to keep its 100,000
troops based in Europe. However a draw down of these could lead to a
weakening of the NATO transatlantic bond, particularly if NATO felt
it had no real role. From a European perspective therefore the long
term security of the continent must centre on the development of a
European foreign and security policy with an ability to carry it out
on a European basis. We are a long way from that as yet.
&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Conclusion</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Europe faces uncertainties, but no
clear major risks to its security in the next decade, provided that
it can manage the transition of the former Soviet Union into a
collection of partner states. This it can best do through the
evolution of the European Union and NATO. Both will need to help
Central and Eastern European nations including Russia with both
economic and security improvements. At the same time, it will remain
important to keep the United States closely involved. There is an
unusual opportunity for enhancing European security at the same time
as enhancing economic prospects. It does however require the Western
European nations to be generous in their help to the rest of
Europe.</FONT></P>
