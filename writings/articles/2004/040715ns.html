			<p>Any thinking member of the military will question the morality of war. The state authorises soldiers to go other lands and kill people. Some of those killed will be innocent bystanders caught in the crossfire, or classified as unavoidable collateral damage.&nbsp; Today we hear British politicians arguing that the 10,000 civilian Iraqis dead from our latest intervention are in some way acceptable in the light of Saddam Hussein's much greater atrocities. Finding a way through the moral and ethical arguments has never been more challenging.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>I first read Michael Walzer twenty years ago after finishing a tour commanding a Vulcan nuclear bomber squadron. If World War 3 had started, I and my squadron&nbsp; would have been flying East to destroy millions of our fellow human beings with bombs far more powerful than the one used on Hiroshima. Spending the following year at Cambridge reflecting on deterrence theory, I found Walzer's seminal work &quot;Just and Unjust Wars&quot; invaluable. He examined the moral dilemma that nuclear deterrence posed. If the mutual&nbsp; threat of an immoral act, the killing of millions, prevented a war between two nuclear powers could it then be moral?&nbsp; I took comfort in his conclusion then that &quot;We threaten evil in order not to do it, and the doing of it would be so terrible that the threat seems in comparison to be morally defensible&quot;.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Whether nuclear deterrence was morally correct or not, the world survived the Cold War, and the role of the military has become yet more complex. It was therefore with some interest that I looked to see what Walzer would make of the quarter of a century of conflicts that had passed since. Unfortunately, &quot;Arguing about War&quot; is not a straight update of his previous volume. It is an edited collection of his magazine articles of the intervening years. The chapters may be ordered in logical subject sequence, but successive chapters skip back forth across years and wars. That the theme hangs together reasonably well is to the credit of Walzer's consistency of argument, but the reader might have more enjoyed a constant perspective from the present.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Since the end of the Cold War, the international community has faced many challenges. Walzer traces the development in his thinking about intervention and just war theory. He explains that the term &quot;just&quot; means no more than justifiable, defensible or perhaps morally necessary given the alternatives.&nbsp; The fight against Nazism gives the easiest example for the just war. The aims of modern interventions are complex. To be a just war, there must be a legitimate reason for action. In humanitarian operations, how much suffering provides the rationale?</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Just war theory has traditionally divided into two parts: the decision to go to war (<i>jus ad bellum</i>); and the conduct of war itself (<i>jus in bello</i>). Walzer proposes a new third consideration of <i>&nbsp;jus post bellum, </i>which he defines a justice after the war. He also highlights how the strategic need for moral conduct of war has become much better understood. The US lost the Vietnam War because it failed to win the hearts and minds battle both at home and in the theatre of operations. A moral approach to warfare is now necessary if the long term aims are to be achieved.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The first major intervention of the post Cold War period was designed to oust Iraqi forces from Kuwait, which had been invaded in&nbsp; August 1990. Walzer, writing immediately after the operation tests, how well it stood up to classical just war theory. He looks at the alternatives to war including economic sanctions, blockades,&nbsp; diplomatic action and negotiated settlement. Politicians like to talk of war as the last resort; but in reality the lesser options can be spun out endlessly without conclusive failure. Walzer argues persuasively that the diplomatic options had to be backed by a credible threat of force against a fixed deadline. When that deadline expired on 15 January 1991, war was a legitimate rather than a last resort.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Just war theory also requires that war be a proportionate response to a situation. Was the value of Kuwait's independence worth all the deaths that would follow a military intervention? Making this assessment is particularly difficult.&nbsp; If&nbsp; there had been a risk of starting a nuclear global war by going to the rescue of Kuwait, then few would have thought it worth defending. New weapon systems reduced the risks of unnecessary deaths on all sides. Not to have taken on Saddam Hussein would have encouraged him to further adventures in the region. The 1991 Gulf War passed these tests. A just war seeks only to restore things to the state they were before the act of aggression. Again, the limited aims of expelling Iraqis forces from Kuwait were sustained. A further push to Baghdad, now argued for by some commentators, would have turned a just war into an act of aggression.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Twelve years later the United Nations came to a different conclusion about an intervention over Saddam Hussein's bad behaviour. Walzer in late 2002 analyses the information available at the time, and concludes reasonably that the conditions for a just war intervention in Iraq did not exist. He titles his article &quot;Inspectors Yes, War No&quot;.&nbsp; He&nbsp; accepts that the moral distinction between preventive and pre-emptive war may have narrowed in the era of weapons of mass destruction. Yet this in his view strengthens the case for continuing inspections. He dismisses the thought that regime change can be a justification for war, particularly given the historical precedents.&nbsp; By early 2003,&nbsp; he is advising anti-war supporters to argue that containment of Saddam remains a better course than war.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Once the 2003 Iraq war is underway, Walzer condemns both Saddam Hussein and George Bush for fighting unjust wars. Saddam has forfeited the right to defend his regime because he has no moral legitimacy. America's war is unjust because there were alternatives to war that could have achieved disarmament at lower cost.&nbsp; However with the war is underway, justice in the conduct of the war becomes the main concern. The central requirement for a&nbsp; just peace after the conflict needs also to be shaped. The Pentagon planners might have done better to think about <i>jus post bellum </i>at an early stage of planning.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Another American,&nbsp; in another age, disagreed with his government's policies about war. Brigadier General Smedley D.Butler was a much decorated Marine officer, whose 1930 writings are reproduced in a slim volume &quot;War is a Racket&quot;. He was decorated for interventions in China, Nicaragua, Cuba and Haiti; and then nearly court-martialled for making offensive remarks about Mussolini. After retirement he accused the US of conducting wars to support big business. He led a march of First World War veterans on Washington DC during the depression; and he is credited with exposing a fascist plot for a coup against President Franklin D.Roosevelt.&nbsp;&nbsp; He came to believe that the US should stay out of all foreign wars, and that there should be a constitutional amendment to prevent the military from operating overseas. He died just before Pearl Harbour might have made him revise his more isolationist views. Yet this book reminds us that armed forces think about what they are asked to do; and perhaps more deeply than the politicians who do the asking.</p>
