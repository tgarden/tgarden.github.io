<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In introducing the ACAS area this morning, I can do little more
than paint a fairly broad picture of the uncertainties against which
we developing our priorities for the future structure of the Royal
Air Force's operational capabilities. We are in times of great change
- change in how UK military force may be used in future; changes in
how it will be organised; and changes in the relative priorities for
different forms of military force.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Let me look first at the Changes in our defence requirements. In
the old days of these sessions we might have started with a
comfortable analysis of the the threat. That is no longer possible.
We have no cohesive potential enemy arrayed across the centre of
Europe, with forces ready to move at a moment's notice. The east is
in such a state of disarray, that we cannot even be certain that its
most senior Generals will stay in post long enough to get home from a
trip to Britain. But this disorder and collapse may pose its own
security concerns. The tens of thousands of nuclear weapons fielded
by the Soviet Union still exist; the aircraft production lines still
roll and Backfires come off the line in numbers that BAe would envy;
the new aircraft carrier sails into the Med this week. Of course we
are safer from a superpower confrontation now than we were five years
ago. But there is instability and the weapons of war. Eastern Europe
is also suffering from strains: economic ethnic and historic. We have
a war raging in Europe at this very moment in Yugoslavia. We have
open rumblings of discontent from the FSU (new acronym for the Former
Soviet Union) military. So that is the nature of the European future
security concern: unpredictable and  potentially dangerous. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Outside Europe, the hollow laugh that OOA used to get from the
developers of British Defence Policy has gone post the Gulf.
Proliferation of missile technology and weapons of mass destruction,
coupled with the dangers of transfer from the crumbling FSU have made
our security interests OOA much greater over a very short period.
Again the threat is unpredictable and potentially dangerous.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>To add to this uncertainty of threat, we have the uncertainty of
organisation with which to meet it. Again in the cold war, we knew
our place in the jigsaw that was NATO. Today, we are not only trying
to build the NATO picture with fewer pieces, but also by putting them
into different places in the puzzle. The European dimension serves
further to add to potential uncertainty with the WEU taking on a role
that would have been unthinkable only a couple of years ago in an
attempt to draw France back into the European Defence fold. The
search for a common European foreign policy within the Community will
also inevitably lead to roles for an EC defence force. But if we have
uncertainty in Europes defence organisations, we also have the
greater possibility of the use of military force on behalf of the UN.
The changes in the Soviet Union have unblocked that organisation as
well, as we saw in the Gulf. So we have more organisations that we
may have to operate within, and more scenarios where we might be
needed. Finally we can add the dimension of arms control to this with
the pan-European nature of the CSCE; in any event that is likely to
give us an aerial verification requirement, although some would like
to see a wider security role.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>If the organisations and alliances that we may have to serve are
changing, so are their internal structures. Of greatest interest to
us is of course NATO. We see nations reducing their in place forces
markedly; looking for a reduction in headquarters; and seeking
changes in degrees of influence. I can only briefly cover the present
state of play and many of you are aware of the detail in any event.
We expect to see one of the three Major NATO Commanders (ACCHAN)
eliminated leaving just SACLANT and SACEUR. In SACEURs area, he will
have three Major Subordinate Commanders: CINCSOUTH - a sailor;
CINCENT - a soldier; and a new post of CINCNORWEST - who logic
suggests should be an airman. The AFNORWEST area would include the UK
land mass, UK Air, an expanded  CINCHAN area; Norway; and probably
the maritime aspects of Baltap. A weighty command area, which High
Wycombe would be ideally placed to run. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>But NATO is also having to change the way its forces are deployed.
The move to Reaction forces, able to deploy relatively rapidly to
supplement now reduced main defence forces is the key. This would buy
time until augmentation forces could be brought into being. The most
reactive of the reaction forces will of course be the air element -
and this has implications for us. By their nature all our forces are
able to react quickly - and the Gulf showed that to the world. We
already have deployment options for the Harrier and Jaguar and we see
them forming a part of NATO's RRF(Air). However the extraordinary
power projection capability of the Tornado GR1, and the unique Recce
capability of the GR1a, mean that we feel it must form a part of this
deployable force. The fact that it is also nuclear capable may also
be a consideration in deterrence terms in the future.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>As NATO changes its structure and forces, so of course are we in
the Royal Air Force. I am not going to spend any time on the Options/
Prospect plot. That is not because it is unimportant, but because you
all know it, and it is the given from where we are starting. What is
important today is discussing how we use the post-Options front line
and the post Prospect organisation to meet the challenges that this
uncertain world of the future brings.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>So let me spend the final few minutes I have outlining the
Operational Priorities  as I see them. I am not going to get head
down in the detail of LTC 92. Many of you are involved in it anyway.
Money is tight - as always - but not as tight as it could have been
following the PES settlement. In any event this can be characterised
as a holding LTC before a General election. So we need today to
consider what is important in the longer term. We have the benefit of
the lessons of the world's first air war: fought from the air and won
from the air. Yes it was unique, yes it was peculiar, yes it will
never happen again - but that is true of every conflict. And in one
sense it may be more representative of potential future conflicts in
the uncertain world I have described. A theatre where the forces have
not trained; extended lines of communication; an ad hoc alliance of
nations; a reliance on control of the air.  This has immediate
implications for out priorities: if we could truly be in any
unpredictable alliance of nations we need to continue to field
balanced forces across the spectrum of capability. We can make
judgements about our potential allies and draw conclusions as to
where the weight of effort is most important. In my view that must be
in offensive capability. That brings us to the questions of weapons. 
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Technology has not moved as fast as it promised in the past to
produced advanced affordable weapons - but it looks as though we are
now reaching a time when significant improvements are possible, and
for some aspects of war will be essential. On the conventional side,
we must move towards stand-off; have the ability to kill the more
demanding targets such as modern armour; and provide precision where
necessary for order of magnitude improvement in mission effectiveness
and for reduction in collateral damage. On the nuclear side for
technical reasons we must replace our current weapon within about the
next ten years. Again you will be aware of both the political and
technical problems - but the substrategic role is essential in the
future, and we will need to provide the best capability that is
possible within the money and time that is available. The TEP is
important for keeping our main offensive aircraft up to date through
what is likely to be a long lifetime. Despite the various teething
problems of the Harrier, it will be a particularly useful capability
in this new world order - and the T10 may offer extra flexibility.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I have already spoken of the emphasis I place on the offensive
role in the future, and our proposed contribution the the RRF(Air)
reflects this. But, Air Defence  will also remain a key requirement.
It has taken thirty years to rebuild the air defences of the UK from
the Sandys decisions of the late fifties. Even now we are taking
risks with capabilities. However the introduction of E3-D into
service, and the coming together of IUKADGE is very encouraging. Much
is hanging on EFA, and we need to be clear that it is our major
priority. Not only will it give us our UK air defence capability, but
a deployable one, and one that can be used for offensive action if
necessary. On area air defence coverage, MSAM has been given new
visibility after the political importance of Patriot was demonstrated
in the Gulf.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Recce is also assuming greater importance. Longer warning times
are of no use unless you have the intelligence to make use of them.
The new longer range systems, both air and ground, are also needing
appropriate targeting information systems, and arms control is
looking for another form of recce capability. Gr1a is a wonderful
success story for the tactical recce requirement, but we still need
to give appropriate weight to the other recce tasks, and they will be
a priority for the future.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>On the Maritime side, there are those - predominently in dark blue
- who would happily see then end of an offensive air maritime role.
Yet this is a key capability which may well be necessary in future
conflicts. Happily, the multi-roling of Tornado with Sea Eagle will
allow us to keep this role going. On the MPA side, we certainly need
to update the current sensor arrangements, and following the P7
cancellation we will need to see what the comparative advantages of
the various options are. Again submarines are proliferating, and
despite the cost of Merlin, it will be very limited in the range of
its activities.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>On tankers and transport,  the new security requirements obviously
put a greater onus on such assets - looking for rapid deployment over
greater distances - this means they are key enablers. My real concern
is that so few nations of potential coalitions or alliances in the
future are adequately scaled in this area. Certainly the ground force
proposals for Europe do not yet seem to have fully though through the
air support bill.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>And if that is true for fixed wing, it is doubly true for rotary
support. The more mobile battlefield, the lack of in place logistic
support, the new peacekeeping, deterrence, relief, evacuation and
every conceivable commitment requires helicopter lift. I have not
talked about the continuing, and apparently increasing, commitment in
Northern Ireland. It is absorbing more and more of our SH forces. The
army plans for AH have yet to quantify the SH they need. One US
figure I have had quoted suggests a need for 1 chinook to support
every 2 Apache. None of this is provided for. We need to get the
Wessex out of service by providing a new airportable LSH which can
also do SF tasks, and we will need more helicopter lift.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Conclusion</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>A very rapid scramble through the way the world is changing both
in the nature of the requirement, and the sort of forces we may need.
In an uncertain world,  air power can provide the reactive flexible
forces for crisis management, deterrence and if necessary winning
wars. Within the financial constraints, which may grow tighter after
an election, we need to be clear on our priorities and how we can
operate in the most efficient way. Can we use the longer warning
times to get more bang for our buck? Can we use multi-roling to
provide  more flexible capability within the available funds? Can we
provide adequate air power for the UK needs within the budgetary and
manpower constraints that we anticipate? These are the sort of
questions that I trust we will be addressing in our seminar sessions.
