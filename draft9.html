<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Chemistry is a branch of science which can all too readily be
discounted as potentially fruitful for military applications. While
we will consider Chemical Weapons in the narrow sense in this
chapter, they represent only one application of chemicals to war. 
The great achievement of the early chemists was the production of
gunpowder, and it is in the field of explosives that they may yet
have much to offer. As with all aspects of modern military
technology, the new weapons draw on many disciplines. Chemical
reactions can provide power in the form of an explosive release of
energy, or as a controlled propulsive force.  Chemicals can kill
through direct effects on different vital functions of human beings,
and they can also provide the protection against such weapons.  They
can provide healing drugs to assist casualties' injuries to heal
rapidly, or disabling drugs to affect the will of a soldier to fight.
Chemicals can be used to attack indirectly through the food chain, or
can provide extra resources through fertilisers and pest control. In
sum, chemistry is used offensively and defensively, and as with so
much of modern science, the products of civilian research play an
important role in the security of a nation.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In modern strategic jargon, Chemical Warfare refers only to the
use of chemical substances which kill or disable living organisms.
While chemical weapons may be dropped on buildings, equipment or
dispersed over territory, it is done to deny access by vulnerable
human beings.  Agents are characterised by five qualities: Stability,
Potency, Persistence, Delay Time and Cost of Production (1).
Stability is a measure of how well a particular chemical agent
retains its potency. Technical developments have worked towards
producing stable agents which can be more easily stored and handled,
while at the same time remaining effective for many years. The
production of binary nerve agents in the United States greatly
enhanced the stability factor of their chemical agents. Potency
reflects the amount of agent necessary to produce the desired effect.
 Development work directed towards increasing potency allows either a
wider area to be covered, or greater range with reduced warhead
payload.  Some agents disperse and lose their effectiveness in a
relatively short- time (often depending on wind); whereas others can
remain effective for days. The tactical situation will determine
whether a persistent or non-persistent agent is preferable. The delay
time is a measure of the time taken between contact with an agent and
the onset of the required effect. It will normally be advantageous to
minimise the delay time. Finally the cost of production of any
chemical agents is important, as large quantities are required for
effective operations, and technology can be directed towards
minimising unit costs.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The range of chemical weapons, which have been developed in the
20th Century, attack the human vital systems in different ways.
Blister agents, causing burns and skin blisters, date from mustard
gas in World War I. Lethal concentrations are difficult to achieve,
and protection is relatively easy.  Blood gases,  like Hydrogen
Cyanide, interfere  with  cell  respiration. Protection can be
achieved through the use of gas masks, but it is possible rapidly to
saturate the breathing filter with such agents. Lung irritants, such
as Phosgene, attack the respiratory system, and again gas masks
provide protection. Nerve agents affect the body's ability to control
muscle action, and lead to death through respiratory failure. Some
such as Sarin must be inhaled, while the V agents can be absorbed
through the skin. They are rapid in effect and can be either
non-persistent  or much longer lasting  low volatile substances.
Protection can only be achieved by whole body and gas mask coverage.
	 	</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>There are occasions when chemicals which incapacitate rather than
kill may be useful. This is  the case with riot control agents, and
also in certain counter- terrorist operations. To incapacitate an
individual, it is possible to attack either the body or the mind with
chemicals.  The widely used phosgene-oxime (CX gas) causes severe
nose and eye irritation to incapacitate. The drug LSD has been
suggested as psycho-chemical agent which would incapacitate  by 
producing hallucinations.  However as predictability of effect is an
important aspect of the use of incapacitating agents,  mind altering
drugs have few attractions at present.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In addition to agents lethal and incapacitating to mankind,  it is
also possible to target other living organisms. Between 1965 and
1971, the US sprayed the South Vietnam jungle with some 10.6 million
gallons of defoliant chemical known as Agent Orange. While this was
done to expose the enemy,  the use of such chemicals on both
vegetation and livestock to deny food resources is also possible.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Looking to a possible future where hostile parties might use the
full spectrum of chemical agents,  a number of avenues for productive
research are apparent.  On the offensive side rapid acting agents, 
with precise and predictable consequences,  which can be produced
easily and safely will be sought. As international control of
chemical weapons is tightened, methods for more covert production may
be sought by some states. The chemical characteristics must take into
account the available countermeasures. Properly fitted gas masks
reduce toxic concentrations in inhaled air by a factor in excess of
100,000 (2). The filter in the mask uses activated charcoal to absorb
vapour, and paper to filter particles. Reagents  against specific
small  molecule chemicals, like Hydrogen Cyanide, can also be
included. Skin protection can be provided by impermeable material
such as rubber, or liquid repellent air-permeable charcoal-lined
cloth. The cloth protection is much less tiring to work and rest in.
Collective protection for troops can be provided in filtered
accommodation. The other necessary part of any defensive system is a
reliable detector for the presence of chemical agents. The detector
must give sufficient warning for protective measures to be adopted.
Finally, in the event of the chemical being absorbed into the body,
it may be possible to provide an antidote. The continuing debate over
the Gulf War Syndrome (3) indicates that taking precautionary drug
protection against chemical and biological threats may have longer
term drawbacks. Chemical decontamination is also a requirement if
operations are to be continued after an attack by a persistent agent.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Research can offer improvements in the effectiveness of chemical
weapons, the efficiency of protective measures, the success of
antidotes and the ease of decontamination. The widespread horror of
chemical warfare and the  Chemical Warfare Convention (CWC) makes
such research limited in democratic states. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Yet the number of nations which may resort to chemical warfare is
increasing. The US Office of Technology Assessment that Egypt, Iran,
Iraq, Israel, North Korea, Libya, Mynamar, Syria, Taiwan and Vietnam
have either a chemical warfare capability or considerable interest in
the development of such a capability.(4)   As one study into the
problem (5) has highlighted, pesticides, which are closely related to
nerve agents, are widely used and increasingly produced in developing
countries. The pesticide production facilities could be used to
produce nerve agents, especially as the development of binary weapons
has made manufacture much safer. Even without such an ability, some
of the pesticides can act as chemical warfare agents in sufficiently
high concentrations. The CWC bans activities involving particular
chemicals, but does not ban the chemicals themselves. Verification of
adherence to the terms of the Convention will therefore be difficult,
and require continuing research into ways in which states might evade
compliance.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Comprehensive chemical disarmament is the ideal, and the CWC has
been a significant step forward in the process. Nevertheless, there
is little prospect of the elimination of the dangers of chemical
attack. The Iran/Iraq war has already shown the impact of chemical
warfare, with the attack on a civilian town by Iraq in 1988. Although
no chemical weapons appear to have been used in the Gulf War, all the
coalition forces were constrained by the threat of such an attack.
Since then, Japan has undergone two terrorist attacks using Sarin.
There is therefore ample evidence for a continuing need for research
into chemical warfare in order to provide effective counters.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>At the lower end of the spectrum, a riot control agent which
disperses a mob without any risk of injury is needed. It may be that
research into psycho-chemicals could be productive. It is possible to
envisage an agent which could generate short-term amnesia,  perhaps
an appropriate phobia to cause dispersal of a crowd, or remove all
aggression. These are likely to be safer approaches than the agents
which  produce  physical  discomfort.  Inevitably  the difficulties
of predicting concentrations of gas in riot areas, make injuries
possible through the overstimulation of body reactions, when using
those chemicals which produce physical reactions. Work on non-lethal
incapaciting agents will require significant continuing research.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In the field of lethal chemical agents, we need to consider how
potential users of chemical weapons will develop their capabilities.
The current range of weapons provide a full spectrum of effectiveness
if they are able to penetrate to the targets. Undoubtedly advances
can be made in each of the qualities discussed above, but the most
productive area for research will be in increasing the penetration of
the agents.  This has implications for delivery systems and dispersal
mechanisms as well as the chemical composition of the agents. Agents
with elements which rapidly saturate filtration systems, or are able
to pass through unattenuated, could prove more effective.  Perhaps
agents which specifically attack the protective materials are
possible.  Another  avenue of approach would be to attempt to deceive
detection systems, so that troops had insufficient warning.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>For the defender, research will be needed for the development of
improved protection systems.  Whatever  the efficacy of the Chemical
Weapons Convention, it would be wise for nations to retain the
technology to protect themselves against this threat.  The material
for protective clothing must not hamper operations, but must protect
against all threats. The filters for gas masks must be both effective
and long lasting. It may be that the development of personal oxygen
generating equipment would offer complete security against inhalation
threats. The research in this area must also extend to vehicle and
building protection, and will inevitably cover the associated threats
from both nuclear and biological weapons.(6)</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In the field of counter-measures following chemical contamination,
there remains much work to be done. The decontamination of equipment
and surfaces of persistent agents is a laborious process. Effective,
rapid and cheap decontamination reagents are needed.  The antidotes
for individuals suffering from chemical exposure are even less
satisfactory. For rapid acting agents, there is little time to
administer antidotes,  which in any event have side effects which
incapacitate. The ideal medical countermeasure would be a preventive
drug, which would be taken before the chemical attack,  and would
have no side effects.  If developed this panacea drug could alter the
balance of advantage in chemical warfare. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Moving away from the narrow definition of Chemical Warfare to the
wider, it is clear that the Chemist is a key developer of
conventional killing systems. High explosive in munitions and
propulsive power from bullets to missiles are all the products of
chemical reactions.  Improvements in conventional munitions have come
from the work of the Engineer in designing explosive charges to match
specific targets. Nevertheless, the characteristics of the explosives
remain a key feature. For a long time weapons have divided into two
classes: the target penetrator and the area weapon. In the last
century, this would be the difference between the  assassin's bullet
and the anarchist's bomb.  The requirements for each type of weapon
system are quite different. For the bullet, shell or missile,
accuracy and predictability of propellant are essential. The
explosive content can be small,  if it is designed to exploit the
target's vulnerability. For the area weapon such as the high
explosive bomb, the explosive power for a given weight becomes the
important factor. Much work has been done on the development of
fuel-air explosives,  which can give a large and uniform overpressure
over a wide area.  The development of explosives with considerable
area destructive capability offer attractions to the military
commander as an alternative to tactical nuclear weapons.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Development work on chemical propulsive fuels also has far to go. 
Missile motors have moved away from the liquid fuel versions, which
made them so vulnerable in their slow reaction times.  Yet solid-fuel
motors require much greater technological expertise if they are to be
reliable and predictable. The fuel must not only burn in the expected
manner, but must also have a long life without deterioration in
performance. At the same time, the more power that can be generated
for a given weight of fuel,  then the greater the warhead that can be
delivered over a given distance. All these aspects of propellant
design are areas rich for the work of the chemist.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In one other area of propulsion, the efficiency of fuel is of
critical importance.  Military forces depend on fuel oil for nearly
all their ships, vehicles and aircraft. While the dire predictions of
a world without oil have temporarily been quieted, oil is a finite
natural resource. In any event, the sheer mass of fuel used in war
brings with it enormous logistic burdens. Research into fuel
technology offers considerable benefits. It may be that an increase
in cost of fuel is acceptable if it reduces the capital cost of a
particular weapon system. One could envisage an aircraft which
required a specific range/payload combination being produced with a
simpler design using a more efficient fuel. If fuel could be
generated compactly where the army was fighting,  its logistic supply
problem would be reduced. Rechargeable electric cells offer a clue,
but remain ludicrously inefficient in power to weight ratios when
compared to the internal combustion engine.  The development of fuels
which allow  prolonged  operations requires a parallel development of
lubricants which can keep mechanical parts operating without
attention for longer periods. In both these fields, it is likely that
commercial pressures will ensure that research continues which may
have military application.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The final area for military interest in the work of the chemist is
in pharmacology. The advent of penicillin was as important in warfare
as many new weapons. If the aim of a particular weapon is to kill, 
its effectiveness can be reduced if the rate of survival is increased
through medicine. The use of antidotes in chemical warfare has
already been discussed.  Immunisation against biological agents will
be considered in Chapter 11. The importance of drugs to promote rapid
return of casualties to combat fitness is obvious. Of increasing
importance will be drugs to derive maximum effort from troops when
required.  The advent of 24 hour operations has made the resting of
troops even more difficult than in the past. The use of drugs to 
utilise fully rest periods, and to stimulate maximum performance when
needed may become the norm.  When this extends to drugs which reduce
fear, or affect the soldier's mind in some other way,  a number of
difficult moral questions arise.  Nevertheless, the possibility of
drug- enhanced combat performance  is  one  which cannot be
discounted in future conflicts.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The chemist has therefore much to offer the military in new
technologies. In chemical warfare the research must be virtually
exclusively military.  Even where the use of such weapons is
prohibited, there will be a continuing need for research into
protective measures and into CWC verification techniques. In fuels
and propellant technology,  commercial considerations are likely to
make civil research the most productive path. In healing drugs and
techniques,  civil  medical  research will produce applicable
techniques.  For drugs tailored to enhance performance under the
stress of combat, it is likely that a specific military research
programme would be necessary.</P>
