<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>My remit is to give you an air staff update to set in context your
detailed presentations on logistics support.  For those in the back
row who may not know what the Assistant Chief of the Air Staff does,
I work in Whitehall and am responsible to CAS for the operational
effectiveness of the Royal Air Force. That is a fairly tall order,
and covering all aspects in 25 minutes would leave you confused and
me breathless.  I thought what I might do instead is look at 3 hot
areas as an illustration of some of the current issues - they are
also areas which I imagine will come up through the rest of the day
and they are inter-related : Options, Granby and the future
programme.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Options</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I am sure that this afternoon you will be dealing with support
implications of Options, but let me start by giving you our thinking
behind the Options package.  When Tom King made the public
announcement in the House on 25th July last year, he envisaged that
the four boat Trident force for nuclear deterrence would be
underpinned by a continuing sub-strategic force of dual capable
Tornados at much the same numerical level as before.   Effective
defence of the UK would remain a key requirement, and that meant a 
comprehensive air defence capability.   The planned Tornado F3 force
would be retained but the Phantoms would be withdrawn.   For the
contribution to the continent, he announced that our stationed forces
in Germany would be roughly halved, but that our contribution would
need to be shaped to fit the force structures of our Allies.   For
the RAF in Germany, he announced a reduction from 4 bases to 2, the
phasing out of the air defence contribution - allowing the Phantom to
be withdrawn from service-, the retention of the Harrier, a reduction
from 8 to 4 Tornado squadrons and a reduction in RAFG SH assets.   On
Berlin, he agreed to Chancellor Kohl's request that the 3 Western
powers would remain while Soviet forces remained in what was the GDR
and that meant we were to keep RAGF Gatow going until then.   In the
maritime area,   the RAF's anti surface ship capability provided by
the ageing Buccaneer would be replaced by one of the Tornado
squadrons withdrawn from Germany (the other 3 being kept in store)
and one of the UK squadrons - but both would keep their strike role
as well.   This was a modernization of our ASUW capability that we
had been seeking for some time. There would also be a  reduction in
our maritime reconnaissance force of Nimrods.  On manpower we would
decrease from around 90,000 to about 75,000.  The plan therefore took
the main cuts in Germany, phased out the Phantom early, and looked to
greater multi-roling. We were therefore broadly content with the
approach, although we felt that we had perhaps lost one Tornado GR1
squadron more than was prudent.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>We formed DOIT to look at the best way to implement these
reductions and generate the maximum benefits in savings on support
costs. Obviously a reduction in the estate was implicit in this work,
and this gave us the chance to consider 3 groups of factors:</P>

<P>					</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>-	Operational</P>

<P>	--	Location; sensitive to task and threat.</P>

<P>	--	Hardening/ Survivability.</P>

<P>		---	COB plans/NATO infrastructure programmes.</P>

<P>	--	Communications.</P>

<P>		Future EFA requirements</P>

<P>-	Economic</P>

<P>	--	Relocation costs.</P>

<P>	--	Reduction in estate support costs.</P>

<P>	--	Manpower mix / contractorisation.</P>

<P>	</P>

<P>-	Quality of Life</P>

<P>	--	Station facilities.</P>

<P>	--	Turbulence/Timing of personnel moves</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The rundown of RAFG was critical to all the other work, and
provides a good illustration of the way we have tackled this
opportunity.  Although taking the cuts where they fell would have
suggested that we should close Wildenrath and then either Laarbruch
or Bruggen, there were other factors.   We were of course conscious
of the relative environmental impact of the various bases.   Also the
closure of two bases close to each other would have a relatively
greater impact on the German economy.   More importantly, from an
operational and quality of life aspect, there was much to be said for
closing Gutersloh - it had dispersed quarters, was cramped, lacked
the survivability of the Tornado bases, and of course its proximity
to the IGB was no longer as relevant.    For all these reasons we
were able to develop a plot which favoured basing 4 Tornado squadrons
at Bruggen, and retained Laarbruch, with its good infrastructure and
survivability, as the base for the other RAFG elements - the Harriers
and a proportion of the helicopters.   I say "a proportion" because
we do not yet having an agreed role and force level for the British
Army in Germany.   We are also now looking at how we need to operate
the Harrier in the future given the strange geostrategic
considerations stemming from Unification.We expect to be able to draw
our AD forces down over the next year, making Wildenrath available
for closure from the end of 1992.   Gutersloh will take a little
longer as we will have to wait until the Tornados have gone from
Laarbruch, before transferring the Harriers, Chinooks and Pumas
there.   We anticipate that, when the rundown is complete, HQ RAFG
will assume Group status under HQ STC, but retaining certain direct
links with the MOD.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	 We are looking to concentrate our Tornado GR1/GR1a/ASUW
operational units in the UK into 2 bases, and are examining the scope
to rationalise other basing arrangements, for example for the Nimrod,
SAR and Jaguar Forces and for the RAF Regiment.   Throughout such
changes, we seek to stagger events to limit the effects of turbulence
on our personnel and on the training machine.   In similar vein, we
are looking at opportunities  to reduce further by concentrating
support activities, such as deep aircraft maintenance and storage
tasks, particularly where these will decrease in size.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Reductions in the Support Area which are at least proportionate
to those in the front line are assumed.   Some flow naturally from
removing types - the Phantom, the Buccaneer and the Hunter - from our
inventory, but we have also to capitalise on the smaller air force to
make more general savings in the whole of the support area.   A
Defence-wide Team following a report by Sir Kenneth MacDonald, the
former 2nd PUS,  known as PROSPECT, has been established to pull
together the various elements of the Support Area Study, and also to
monitor implementation of the MOD slimming process.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Training is another area where we are examining our future
needs closely.   Pilot shortfalls mean that we must maintain current
levels of flying training throughput.   Nevertheless, we have
developed proposals which will reduce our basic flying training
schools from 3 to 2, while the creation of 2 mirror image combined
AFTS/TWUs will permit closure of one of the Hawk flying training
bases.  </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Options then gave us a chance to restructure our inventory, and
as you can see, we decided to retain all our roles: sub-strategic
nuclear, air defence, offensive counter air, air interdiction, close
air support, reconnaissance, maritime, transport tactical and
strategic- fixed and rotary wing, and air to air refueling. A week
after the public announcement, Saddam invaded Kuwait and the first
lesson of the Gulf became apparent: you never know quite what you are
going to be asked to do in the future, and therefore giving up
capabilities in a particular role can be a dangerous economy. 
Moreover the balance between equipment and people will remain as
important as ever. As I indicated we are very concious of quality of
life aspects in our options work. We are fortunate that it does not
seem likely that we will need to have redundancy. But we do need to
make sure we have got our manpower planning right - we have been
operating with nearly a 10% deficit for far too long.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Granby &amp; Op Haven</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Time will not allow me to give you a blow by blow account of the
Gulf War.  In any event, for once everyone was able through
television to have a vivid instantaneous picture of the various
phases, and you will be covering the logistics support aspects in the
second half of this morning.  It was a coalition war and it was above
all else an air war. From the UK perspective this meant an immediate
deployment of a squadron of F3 air defence Tornado - 48 hours from Go
to in theatre and operational. Another 48 hours and the first
offensive aircraft - a squadron of Jaguar. There followed
progressively Tornado GR1 for greater offensive power, GR1a for
Recce, Buccaneer for laser designation, Nimrods for the maritime ops,
Chinooks and Pumas for support of the ground forces, transport and
tankers to support the whole operation. Our aircraft were involved in
every major role except sub-strategic nuclear that I have just
mentioned. It was a salutary warning that we were right under Options
not to contemplate giving up a major role capability. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>We sre currently analysing the many lessons from the campaign, and
it will be some months before they are all available.  Let me just
head up a few of the issues which need to be considered for the
future. Low level operations is certainly one. We have optimised our
aircraft and weapons for low level delivery against the assumption
that life would always be more dangerous the higher you were. Since
the air forces were given a relatively free ride once above the
height of AAA (and even that was relatively ineffective), medium
level operations became possible and we needed some quick fixes in
terms of weapons. Maybe that opportunity will never come again, but
we had better consider it  in our future planning. Next is the
question of balance between precision and dumb weapons. Here it is
easy to get so enthused by the shots of Cruise Missiles and LGB
attacks as to forget that the vast majority of firepower delivered
onto Iraq was conventional dumb bombs. Certainly the high tech
solutions were impressive, but they will never be affordable in the
numbers necessary to conduct a prolonged air campaign. For many jobs,
where collateral damage is not an issue, they may not be the most
effective weapon. The third issue to consider is the question of how
far we can depend on industry and PE to pull out the stops to rectify
known weaknesses at the last moment. Just like Corporate, Granby was
a great success story for such mods across all our aircraft and
weapons. But again that was a function of available time before
hostilities broke out - can we always plan on that? Then there is the
question of uniformed manpower available for rapid deployment - and I
think we will have some useful evidence for our requirements in the
future. Finally, I would raise the question of Reserves. The Gulf
made us realise how dependent we had already become on Reserves for
various specialist activities, and also the reluctance that Ministers
show when asked to authorise their use. Despite the pressures on
moving to greater use of Reserves, I believe the experience of the
Gulf War has shown that we need to be cautious.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The drain on our resources from the Gulf continues - we have just
recovering the last  Tornado squadron in theatre. Of course Operation
Haven, has also caused us to switch our Chinook assets to the North
now both in support of relief operations and also for those tasks
which 3 Cdo Sea King's can't do in the height and heat of the
mountains.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Lessons learned from the Gulf will be a time coming, but I can
hardly improve on the analysis of my good friend Lawrence Freedman,
Professor of War Studies at Kings London, who wrote in the
Independent on 1 March:</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>But if any one lesson can be drawn from this war it is this: that
it is impossible to conduct a ground war having conceded command of
the air to the enemy.  The allies were always able to fight in three
dimensions while Iraq was confined to only two.  Those responsible
for planning Western armed forces in the light of the end of the Cold
War will now seek to ensure that superiority in air power is never
lost.</P>

<P>The Programme</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The Threat, it is less certain, less immediately catastrophic in
Europe, but increasingly high intensity wherever conflict breaks out.
That suggests that deployability, range, speed of reaction, and
flexibility are the sort of key words we need to look for in threat
response.  Gaining control of the air is the key to successful land
or sea operations. It is impossible to predict whether offensive or
defensive counter air will have the ascendancy in any operation - and
the capability for both is therefore needed. Rapid application of
massive firepower will be needed in any conflict. The arguments about
the balance between close air support, battlefield air inderdiction
and deep inderdiction are sterile. Each is necessary, and the balance
between them is a dynamic of the battle. If choices have to be made
between systems, then we must go for the ones that can cover all
three requirements.</P>

<P>So we need everything, but the reality of resource constraints
says we cannot have everything.  What then is the answer? It must be
to retain roles through multi-roling aircraft, designing aircraft and
weapons for multi-role capability. The current structure of the Royal
Air Force reflects this, the planning under options looked to retain
all the roles, and the procurement of EFA continues this pattern.  We
face a very uncertain world, and one in which flexibility - the key
characteristic of air power - will need to be exploited to the full. 
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>											</P>

<P>	Clearly,  Options work has been a key part of the LTC process. 
Money has been a considerable difficulty and there remains a question
mark against the affordability of the Options package.  we have had
already to propose additional saving measures.   </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P> In the air defence area, Tornado ADV's future is now, I think,
clear, and rather than pursue any major improvements for the F3
beyond the Stage 2 radar programme, (and we have had a significant
upgrade to a part of the fleet for use in the Gulf) we plan to
replace the  fleet progressively with EFA when it comes into Service,
starting at about the turn of the Century. I will be working hard to
ensure that it comes in in the right numbers with the right weapons.
One of the difficulties I will have to face is perhaps a constant
nibbling at force levels to meet short term savings requirements.  
Furthermore, we need to replace the Bloodhound capability as soon as
possible with a modern Surface to Air Missile. .   Introduction to
Service of our Airborne Early Warning aircraft, the E3D, is
progressing well, and the troubled Improved UK Air Defence Ground
Environment is now making good progress.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P> 	On the maritime side, an early replacement for Nimrod is the
priority.   We had planned to purchase the Lockheed P7, but this is
no longer under development, and therefore we are now examining
closely an enhanced Lockheed P3-C.   Our Maritime attack capability
has been addressed as part of Options, as discussed earlier by
replacing Buccaneer with Tornado.  </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P> 	The Tornado GRl has received some excellent modifications for
Operation GRANBY and with a major fleet enhancement programme
imminent, it is set to retain its effectiveness well into the first
decade of the next Century.   A replacement for the Tornado GRl's
tactical nuclear weapon is  required, and a decision on the way ahead
for a stand-off nuclear weapon is due to be taken later this year.  
On the conventional weapons front, we are addressing the  development
of a stand-off weapon to replace the JP 233 and, at the moment,
funding is firm to meet this requirement.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Turning to the Jaguar, during our Options for Change
deliberations we concluded that, because the fleet was
extraordinarily cost-effective for its firepower, it should remain in
Service ( and the Gulf proved this beyond doubt).   The question of
whether or not it should eventually be replaced was, however, left
open. The core assumption remains replacement by EFA on a one-for-one
basis, and I will be stressing EFA's multi-role characteristics in
preparation for the production investment decision which is due next
year.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Turning to Recce, our proposals for tactical recce envisage an
eventual rationalisation on Tornado and EFA, and we are still
examining how we fund a Recce capability for the Harrier GR5/7.   For
strategic tasks, we plan to replace the PR9 Canberra with an aircraft
such as Gulfstream, which will primarily provide a long range
stand-off radar capability and also be available for CFE verification
and Open Skies. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>We decided recently to rationalise the Air Transport and Air to
Air Refuelling fleets because of the declining availability of the
passenger version of the VC10 and the rising cost of the projected
Tristar refuelling pod programme.   To offset the loss of planned
air-to-air refuelling capability, we have funded the conversion of
the remaining 5 passenger VClOs to 2-point tankers.   However, we
have not been able, this year, to fund a new VVIP transport to
undertake both the Andover and VC10 VVIP tasks.  For the Air
Transport Force plot, our priority is the introduction of the   
C-130J on a rolling replacement programme for the Hercules.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>There is also a glimmer of light at the end of the long and dark
Support Helicopter tunnel, and we now intend to replace most of the
Puma fleet by a new Light Support Helicopter, which will, in turn,
allow the ageing Wessex to be replaced and retired.     	</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	In addressing Options, I have already spoken of the balance
between people and equipment and between the front line and the
support area.   The balance I have not yet addressed is the key one
of platforms and weapons, and this is where LTC 91 has been
particularly difficult since weapons constitute a major and
increasingly expensive element of the equipment programme and have,
therefore, been vulnerable.   Important new weapons in prospect
include ASRAAM, the Advanced Short Range Air-to-Air Missile, with
which we have made encouraging progress in the last year, and 1238
which is our projected stand-off anti-armour weapon.   Despite
technical, financial and inter-Service difficulties, we hope to make
good progress in the coming year on this important advanced air
delivered anti-armour weapon.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Concluding Remarks</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>		This has been a gallop around the air staff operational
imperatives which shape the way each of you will have to provide
support for the front line. Because that is what each of us must do.
It is difficult in a time of uncertain requirements and budgetary
restraints. But as we saw in the Gulf, any nation which gets its air
power wrong, will lose the war.</P>
