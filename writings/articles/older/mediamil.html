<P>	It is always exciting to discover a new field of intellectual
pursuit. Dr Young is an Associate Professor in Defence Media Studies
in Australia, and seems intent on providing course material. I trust
that the Defence Media students will be given a grounding in history,
international relations and strategic studies first, so that they may
approach the subject with rigour. There are certainly important
issues to be considered in the relations between the media and
military operations. New communications technologies, coupled with
the diversity of news outputs, mean that governments cannot ignore
the "CNN Factor". The debate is usually about reporting of situations
which may drive policy changes towards more intervention. This is not
the question that the authors address. They seek to show that
governments and the military obstruct the media and use it for their
own nefarious purposes.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Young and Jesser have no doubts about the place of the media in
the hierarchy of accountability. They are surprised that during World
War II Winston Churchill, despite his journalistic background,
"consistently bypassed the press on important issues by broadcasting
direct to the nation or making statements in Parliament". This
arrogance affects their descriptions of virtually every campaign. Nor
is the difference between media handling at the strategic and the
tactical level properly separated. They seem to expect governments
and the military to share every stage of operational planning and
execution with any representative of the Press. They expect the media
to act as a powerful restraint on action, noting that Australian
public opinion is now less favourably disposed towards defence. In
looking at the Falklands conflict, they castigate "the win at all
costs attitude displayed by the politicised military". It is not
Argentina but Britain that they accuse, and that criticism is even
stronger over Northern Ireland policy. But most of their indignation
is directed at the United States in Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, the
Gulf War, Somalia and Haiti. For those who have forgotten the "Desert
Strike" in the title, it merits just a single page, and Suez fails to
make the index.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>It is difficult to recommend the outlay of &#163;50 for such
biased analysis. There is no lack of footnotes to give a veneer of
authority. An example (page 275) is the assertion that a policy of
deceit and denial in Northern Ireland continues to this day. The
relevant footnote is for publications dated  1972 and 1974. There is
a place for the debate over the differing needs of government,
military and press in military operations. This volume does not
provide it.The rationale for the book becomes apparent in the
conclusion. The authors explain that their Australia-based
International Defence Media Association is the only international
lobby group able to counter the dominance of the military. Single
issue lobby groups usually give their propaganda away, rather than
expect the punter to pay for it.</P>
