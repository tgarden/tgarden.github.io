<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	As I write, yet another "last deadline" approaches for an
agreement between the Serbs and ethnic Albanians over Kosovo. The
only factor that is able to keep them talking is the threat of
imminent air strikes. It seems that every month, there is a new
threat of bombing to help the diplomatic process in one of the
world's difficult areas. </P>

<P>	Yet, the end of the Cold War has returned us to an age where
the tools of diplomacy can be used more flexibly. No longer is the
primary concern which camp, West or Communist, benefits from any
change in strategic balance. Of most of the day to day interactions
between states, the wider public remains blissfully unaware. Trade
discussions only hit the headlines when local jobs are threatened by
the outcome. Arms control negotiations rarely impinge beyond  a small
elite. Even major international treaty changes, such as NATO
enlargement, wring few withers among the British public. However, the
prospect of our military being in action will invariably hit the
headlines. We have seen an extraordinary rise in the use of threats
of force by the West to underpin diplomatic strategy. We have
restructured our forces so that they are tailored to such actions.
</P>

<P>	The sequence of media reporting in the UK is now well
rehearsed. The crisis with its human suffering is reported in detail.
The brutal invasion of Kuwait, the fleeing of the Kurds in Northern
Iraq, the plight of the Marsh Arabs in Southern Iraq, the  miseries
in Somalia, the refugees in the Great Lakes, the atrocities in
Bosnia, and now the inhumanities of Kosovo are all brought to life on
the television news. In most cases, there will have been work going
on behind the scenes through normal diplomatic channels, through the
United Nations and through Non Governmental Organisations to try to
prevent a crisis or alleviate the suffering. For those events in
which one or more players are acting in an unacceptable or illegal
manner, the focus turns to methods to coerce more reasonable
behaviour.</P>

<P>	The United Nations is not yet the universal international
policeman able to enforce an agreed body of international law. It has
no standing police or military force, no assurance of agreement for
action and indeed in many cases no certainty of interpretation of
international law. Yet there are well established norms of behaviour,
reinforced by the universal declaration of human rights, with which
to measure whether particular behaviour by a State needs
international action.  The process of negotiating agreed Security
Council resolutions is again not a part of diplomacy which will
excite the public, who are telling their elected representatives that
"something must be done". Resolutions for imposing sanctions lack the
thrill of deploying military capability, and, as we have seen in
Iraq, can over time be turned into useful propaganda issues for the
transgressor.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	We have become used to the call for the threat of force to back
diplomatic negotiation. So long as the negotiations appear to have a
reasonable hope of success, there is not much criticism of such
threats if they will speed the process to arrive at a reasonable
settlement. However, once the use of force becomes likely, media
opinion becomes more critical. If air strikes are to be a regular
tool of diplomacy, we need to make sure that we face up to the
problems of sustaining political will. There is much to learn from
the successes so far. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	The threat of force must always be underpinned by the political
will to use the force if necessary. Empty threats undermine the
ability of the international community to take action in future
crises. This does not mean that bombing should be entered into
lightly. When deadlines are extended in the hope of achieving
diplomatic resolution, commentators must not characterise this as
weakness or lack of resolve. Such delays show how seriously the
allies take the use of force as the method of last resort in the
diplomatic process. It is a very difficult moment to decide when all
alternative avenues have been exhausted. The last minute faxed
agreement by Saddam Hussein in February 1998 was an example of
ultimate brinkmanship. The waiting bombers were rightly stood down.
When the crisis began again in August, the process leading to the
December bombing campaign of Desert Fox was much more acceptable to
Western publics because of the flexibility shown earlier in the year.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	When the fateful decision to use force is made, the first
question for both government and the media commentators must be what
outcome is sought through the bombing. What are the political and
military aims? It will often be said that an intransigent leader will
be bolstered at home by a bombing campaign. Perhaps, we should always
be prepared to think of the rationale for the use of force in terms
of the three 'C's: Coercion, Containment and Chastisement.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Coercion is the stick with which the transgressor is threatened
in order to make him more amenable to a negotiated settlement. In the
Cold War we were used to the concept of nuclear force as a deterrent.
It was designed to prevent something undesirable from happening.
Force today will sometimes be used in a purely deterrent sense, but
is more likely to be there to coerce a State, or even non-State
actor, into a particular course of action. The diplomatic process
must continue during and after the bombing campaign so that the
coercive aims can be achieved.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Containment is an important ingredient of the design of the
military intervention campaign. The problem which generated the
international crisis in the first place must be addressed. If Iraq
threatens its neighbours, the bombing campaign can be designed to
reduce that threat. If the Serbian forces are likely to massacre the
Albanians in Kosovo, their movements can be restricted by the use of
air power. If the Kurds are driven out of their homes to take refuge
on the mountains in Northern Iraq, intervention forces can provide
them with safe havens and security to return to their homes.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Chastisement is the most difficult element in the intervention
plan. The media will often characterise a bombing campaign as being
used to punish Saddam or Milosevic. If it is possible to weaken key
supporting elements of the leadership, punishment for failure to keep
to previously given undertakings may be open to punishment in this
way. Thus attacks on the Republican Guard in Desert Fox could be seen
as partly chastisement and partly contributing to both containment
and coercion.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	When the media asks what good will bombing serve, the answer
must always be framed in terms of the alternative outcomes if the
threat to bomb were removed. Are the likely outcomes, both short term
and in the longer term for peace in the world, better or worse? In
the past 10 years, there are more examples of the threat of military
intervention helping the diplomatic process than there are of it
causing greater chaos. Bombing is an important diplomatic tool.</P>
