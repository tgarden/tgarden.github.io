			<h4>Countering Terrorism</h4>
			<h4>Tim Garden</h4>
			<h5><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Liberal Democrat Spring Conference Southport - 21 March 2004</font></h5>
			<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
			<p>The tragic and violent deaths of 200 people, and the further 1400 injured, in the multiple bomb attacks in Madrid have reminded us - if we needed reminding - that we are all at risk from terrorism. Spain faces its home grown ETA terror, as well as the fanatical offshoot of militant  Islam, which murders and maims on a global scale. It is not just Europeans and Americans who are targets. We see Iraqis, Afghans, Pakistanis, Indians, Saudis, Russians, Indonesians, Africans and Australians among those killed at the hand of al-Qaeda franchised terror groups. We condemn all terrorism - but we must also have a strategy.</p>
			<p>We have an internatonal terrorist problem that needs international solutions. Combatting terror must take place at many levels. For long term success, we must starve the fanatics of their recruits, their finance and their supporters. Rushing to war in Iraq, without the support of the international community has made that more difficult. We Lib Dems warned of the consequences, and our judgement was right. But we must work with the world as it is. Britain now has an obligation to help to get Iraq to function as a democratic state. Almost every mistake in the book has been made. The Iraqi people - all the Iraqi people - need to feel they have a say in the future of their country. The UN must legitimise the process, and we must be prepared to help bear the cost and pain of rebuilding the nation and securing the rule of law.</p>
			<p>In Afghanistan we have the process right with UN involvement, but we have failed to provide the necessary security. The Taleban and warlords are returning; the opium harvest is a bumper one. NATO must respond to Hamad Karzai's request for more troops. Nor should we forget Kashmir, which has spurned so many terror movements. The fragile India-Pakistan peace process needs every help we can give. </p>
			<p>Nor can we abandon the Israeli-Palestine situation. The promise that the road to Jerusalem lay through Bagdhad seems very hollow now. Leaving the problem to fester brings yet more misery to Israelis and Palestinians alike. The anger, over injustices to the Palestinians, among muslims around the world, acts as recruiting sergeant for al-Qaeda. Nor can we lorget the unfinished work in the Balkans as events in Kosovo have reminded us. All of these areas of violence and injustice need sustained international effort with the United Nations providing legitimacy. </p>
			<p>Yet, important as the long term strategy is, the immediate threats to our citizens will remain for many years. We may suffer our own Madrid - or worse. The Spanish people showed by taking to the streets in their millions that they would not be cowed by terrorism. We may need to show similar resilience. Guantanamo Bay and Belmarsh prison are not the answers to terrorism. Certainly good intelligence, with international co-operation, can reduce risks. But the terrorist has so many targets in so many countries. We must also be prepared to cope with the aftermath of an attack, and to deal with the injured quickly. In this respect, Spain did outstandlingly well. In the UK, local authorities need the cash to meet their emergency planning duties. The terrorist looks for soft targets, which may mean places other than London.</p>
			<p>As a party, we Liberal Democrats have shown consistency and wisdom in dealing with these difficult issues. The world would have been different if our way had been followed. But we must live with others' past incomptence and misjudgment. We must continue to point the most effective way forward.</p>
