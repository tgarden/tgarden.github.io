<ADDRESS><CENTER>Presentation to Secretary of State - 30 October 1991
</CENTER></ADDRESS>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>1.	Secretary of State, I do not intend to paint a detailed threat
picture - even if I could today -  but to look at how the current
trends in security needs affect our thinking about the role of air
power in future. The world security order has changed markedly over
the past two years. We  are having to come to terms with much less
certain requirements.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>2.	Yet recent events in Europe are leading both to reductions in
force levels - both for us and our Allies - and changes in the
readiness and availability of the remaining forces.  But if the
threat is now less great, it is also less predictable, and there is a
consequent shift of emphasis from capabilities needed to defend
against a large direct threat towards conflict prevention and crisis
management.  At the same time, there is increasing emphasis on
international cooperation for management of security concerns beyond
the NATO area of interest; and finally there are our continuing
national security concerns both at home and overseas.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>3.	We have therefore the problem of managing our security
interests against a backdrop of potential instabilities, large
military capability to be disposed of, and declining in-place forces
to police the transition. It is against this background, and the
recent practical example in the Gulf War, that the key role which air
power has to play has become more widely recognised. With these
opening thoughts, I shall develop briefly what it means to our future
air force structure and concepts.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>Key Characteristics of Air Power</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>4.	We need to look to our future forces in the light of a
requirement to defend against less predictable threats, while
providing a credible response from reduced numbers at lower states of
readiness. Happily air power has the ideal characteristics to solve
the problem.  The byword on every airman's lips is Flexibility . 
Given the appropriate arrangements, air power can cover a wide range
of possible  threats without the need for them to be closely defined
in advance.  Through multi-roling, we can take on a much wider range
of tasks for a given number of aircraft. These threats can emerge in
different places and so the Mobility, which air power provides to
both firepower and ground forces is a key to crisis management.  The
third key characteristic is that of Responsiveness.  We have seen how
rapidly trouble can flare up around the world with little
forewarning. Again the knowledge that we can respond quickly and
powerfully is in itself an important factor in bringing political
pressure to bear for resolution short of conflict.  Again we have
seen this form of signalling in order to pressurise Iraq into
compliance with the UN resolutions on inspection. The next stage
would be the deployment of air power capabilities.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>5.	Depending on the context, of course, air power can provide a
more acceptable show of force than the insertion of ground forces and
can even achieve a deterrent effect from outside the potential
conflict zone.  Its deployment is politically easier than ground
forces - and its extraction is faster and cleaner.  And of course if
as a last recourse we have to resort to the use of force, we must not
forget one of the key lessons we learnt from the Gulf war; the ground
war would never have been envisaged without the hugely successful
preceding offensive air campaign.  Only the latter could guarantee
the low casualty rates our media driven public have now come to
expect.  I suggest that this is a trend for the future, as we look
more to crisis management outside traditional areas of interest; a
successful opening air campaign preparing the way will invariably be
essential and critical.  As in Iraq, winning the air war is the vital
factor.  But the maintenance of these characteristics and
capabilities involves relatively high readiness and hence readily
available personnel and equipments in a war-fighting condition. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Air Power in Crisis Management</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>6.	The use of air power as a crisis management tool is not new.
Nor need it be of an overtly military nature. At one end of the
spectrum is the  rapid deployment of humanitarian aid during critical
stages following natural disasters. Military aircraft employed on
relief operations can promote stability and security. The examples
are many. In recent years we have been involved in such places as
Ethiopia, Mexico, Colombia and Bangladesh responding to the need for
aid following famine, earthquake, flooding or other natural disaster,
with great benefits to UK influence. Op HAVEN and WARDEN are 
examples of the next stage up in such relief operations. Here some
military protection is necessary as well as the relief of the
starving and displaced Kurds. These operations are met by military
air transport, with an appropriate mix of fixed wing and helicopters.
 Here it was initially the Hercules and the Chinook to carry relief
supplies and move troops, refugees and the sick. To disengage ground
forces, the threat of offensive air action, through our Jaguars, was
an interesting rerun of the use of cost-effective policing from the
air first carried out by the RAF in Iraq in the 20s.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>7.	Moving along this spectrum of crisis management, the
surveillance possible by air  systems can be a key to stability. Arms
control agreements and UN resolutions following conflict must  be
verifiable. Indeed air reconnaissance can provide both increased
confidence in compliance and a deterrent against non-compliance. In
this respect the role of aircraft in  Open Skies is an area where the
UK should wish to play a part. Again, the movement of powerful
surveillance capabilities into a region can be used as a signal of
concern about the actions of a potential aggressor.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>8.	If conflict seems probable, the rapid deployment of air defence
capability will be an early priority. Airmen have always spoken of
the importance of control of the air in any war. Keeping enemy air
attacks at bay is crucial - as Iraq learned to its cost. If conflict
is likely, then its resolution will require the ability to deploy
convincing offensive firepower. Again aircraft can provide such a
show of resolution at short notice, and if war has broken out can
provide the time for main defence forces to ready themselves and
deploy to theatre.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>9.	Thus at every level from humanitarian aid to the risk of high
intensity conflict, military air power has a key role to play in
providing policy options to governments and alliances.  To provide
these options however requires properly structured, equipped and
trained air forces.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Future Air Power Roles</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>10.	What then are the roles which air forces need to train and
equip for against these new requirements?  Here, I expand the
requirements beyond crisis management to the ability to resolve
conflict, and also the continuing need to contribute to purely
national security needs. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>11.	It is clear that for national as well alliance and world
security needs, air defence remains a key role. Each nation will want
to be able to ensure the integrity of its airspace, work within an
alliance to protect the members from aggression, and be able to
provide air defence cover for any other military capability that is
deployed. When we look at how we are equipped in the UK, the Tornado
F3 provides an interceptor capability optimised for the peculiar
geostrategic position of the UK.  It can intercept bombers at long
range before they release their stand-off missiles against targets in
the UK, although its effectiveness is constrained by its ageing
missiles and its lack of ability to counter electronic warfare
measures with its radar.  We also have a much more limited point
defence capability with Rapier and armed Hawk aircraft.  Furthermore,
the F3's lack of agility makes it unsuitable for close-in fighting
and its lack of modern self defence systems make it less surviveable
in hostile airspace.  Thus, we are also not well provided for air
defence scenarios beyond the UK and, for these reasons, the F3 will
not be a prime choice for deploying to other areas.  This all makes
EFA a key requirement for the future, both at home and for a
deployable air defence option.  The fact that EFA can also be used to
attack ground targets makes it even better</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>12.	Even in this new more defensively orientated world order,
offensive air assets will be needed.  The ability to destroy or
neutralise enemy air capability is not only fundamental to an
effective air campaign, but an essential pre-cursor to the land/air
battle.  Moreover, the flexibility to attack an enemy's second
echelon and war fighting infrastructure while also contributing to
the contact battle is an attribute derived only from air assets.  As
a maritime nation we recognise the importance of our sea lines of
communication and, in this respect, the Nimrod MR served us well in
its primary ASW role.  We are now seeking a worthy successor to this
ageing aircraft to maintain this vital capability.  For deterrence,
the risk of punishment from air attack is an important aspect. The
nature of these offensive capabilities may be changing as more
precise application of military force is demanded - but fortunately
technology is helping us in this respect. If we find ourselves
fighting a war, offensive combat aircraft remain vital to counter the
opposition's air, land and sea forces.  Here we are much better
provided for in the UK than are some other nations. The Jaguar force
provides a moderate level of capability, at very low cost, which can
be deployed at very short notice and maintained on deployment for
prolonged periods of time. It can in daylight deliver reasonable
offensive firepower and also carry out reconnaissance.  EFA will
replace Jaguar in this role at the turn of the century.  The new
Harrier GR5/GR7 is coming into service now and provides a day and
night capability from very rudimentary operating strips.  The Tornado
GR1 - to be updated to the GR4 - gives the deep penetration long
range all weather day night capability against almost any type of
target, including, in the near future, ships. In all this the weapons
are every bit as important as the aircraft that have to deliver them,
and here we have been less well placed in some areas. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>13.	The balance of investment between weapons and the platforms
has been an area of concern for many years. The JP233 anti-airfield
weapon and the Sea Eagle missile represent few areas of successful
development. With the exception of the day-only Pave-Spike capability
provided by the Buccaneer, and the limited TIALD capability provided
for the Tornado GR1 we have had to continue to rely on dumb free fall
bombs.  The Gulf war has given a much needed priority to altering the
balance towards precision weapons and we are looking to provide a
much increased TIALD capability for our Tornado GR1s. They are
important in two ways: precision is needed for the offensive
operations under the close scrutiny of the world's media; and it is
also needed to improve the effectiveness of missions against hard
targets.  But in one area, the way ahead is still disturbingly
unclear.  Tanks still remain important targets in any conflict. 
While there are a plethora of ground-based anti-tank weapons, the
longest range , fastest responding anti-armour system - the Harrier -
is still without a suitable weapon to use.  </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>14.	Of course our wish for all weapons is to release them as far
away from the enemy defences as possible to preserve as many as
possible of our limited number of platforms. This is why stand-off is
a key aspect of so many of the future weapon systems. We have
provided a stand-off capability for our Sea Eagle and Harpoon
anti-ship weapons, and it might be useful to mention why we attach
such importance to it for the future theatre nuclear weapon. I know
that I do not need to rehearse the rationale for a sub-strategic
system to underpin the submarine based strategic deterrent force. 
Nuclear weapons delivered from aircraft will in the post
INF/SNF/START era be the only way to provide that capability - and
give us any redundancy in nuclear systems. We will be thinking in
terms of relatively small numbers of weapons, which must have a high
chance of successfully carrying out their very carefully planned
missions. Unless it is clear that this is the case, their use will
appear incredible, and their role in the deterrence structure will be
undermined. The best way to provide that assurance of success is to
release the weapon well away from enemy defended territory and make
it difficult to intercept by making it supersonic and stealthy. These
thoughts lead to the sort of characteristics being discussed for
TASM.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>15.	While discussing weapons, it might be useful for me to
mention the air defence side as well. The lack of an upgrade to the
Tornado F3 will of course leave it without a modern missile.
Interestingly, until the advent of EFA with AMRAAM and ASRAAM, we
shall be defending the fleet with better and AI radar missiles than
we provide to defend the UK.  For surface to air missiles, we have
taken a risk with the early withdrawal of Bloodhound. However, the
political importance of a deployable air defence missile with a
limited counter ballistic missile capability, as seen with Patriot in
the Gulf, has strengthened our wish to get on with procuring such a
system as soon as practicable.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>16.	The aircraft I have been talking about so far are those that
deliver weapons, but as I indicated earlier air reconnaissance and
air transport are also key capabilities to be able to respond to the
new uncertainties. Reconnaissance can be of the sea - with the Nimrod
- covering vastly greater areas than can ships' helicopters. The
Nimrod's systems, however, are progressively becoming less capable
against modern nuclear and diesel submarines.  Improvements are
required before we lose this important ASW capability.  It can be of
the air - with the really remarkable capability we are now getting
with the E3D Sentry aircraft.  It can be of the electromagnetic
spectrum - and you will be aware of how valuable our small force of 3
Nimrod R is in intelligence gathering. Finally it is needed for the
land in so many ways. We need strategic reconnaissance to keep up to
date our mapping, force dispositions and longer term intelligence.
Satellites can of course do much, but are very predictable in their
orbits. Unfortunately our Canberra strategic recce is getting very
long in the tooth, but it is a capability which we need to retain as
a nation. At the tactical level we have an excellent system in the
Tornado GR1a - which incidentally flew low level throughout the whole
of the Gulf conflict to get the best imagery - and without a single
loss. The Jaguar can also provide a recce capability. The bit that is
missing is the ability to monitor the battle on the ground as it is
happening, and bring weapons (both air and ground) on to highly
mobile targets. The technology is there and we have done some good
work towards introducing such a capability.  Having identified a
threat or target, credibility also depends upon the means to destroy
it.  In this context, our offensive contribution to the land/air
battle must continue to be complemented by an offensive maritime
capability based, not only on the Tornado ASUW squadrons already
agreed, but also on an up-to-date force of Maritime Patrol Aircraft.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>17.	In this new world, the ability to deploy force far and fast
is a key. There is never enough air transport and the bulk of ground
force deployments are constrained by the need for slow sea lift. In
the past we have got round that by concentrating our rapid deployment
capability on lightly equipped troops, or by prepositioning heavy
equipment.  Our new RRC concepts will of course put a much greater
demand on air transport.  Civilian charter will of course be an
important aspect, but the need for certainty for key deployments at
short notice will increase the demands on military air transport,
which in any case will be needed for tactical operations in any
theatre of war.  The Tristar gives us great capacity - it was
invaluable for transporting the JP233s we needed for  Granby. The
VC10s are showing their age, but again were able to fly at
extraordinary rates of effort for the build up to the war, during the
air and land battle, and for the return at the end. In theatre, the
tactical flexibility of the Hercules is the key. They will need
replacing or refurbishing relatively soon, but it looks very much as
if the best solution will be another Hercules.  I do not doubt that
special forces will continue to have a key role in the sort of future
world we are considering. For that reason we are working hard to
provide the necessary covert operation capability to the Hercules and
its successor?</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>18.	If air transport becomes more important then so does air to
air refuelling as we consider potential areas in Europe that are
further away, and deployments elsewhere worldwide. Here we are able
to take advantage of having our transport aircraft equipped to give
fuel. We can at much less expense run a fleet of aircraft that
provide transport lift or tanking capability in any blend. A
deployment can be done using the a Tristar to carry parts of the
support equipment and personnel, while it also refuels the combat
aircraft on their way to the theatre of operations.  </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>19.	One last aspect of transport is the key one of helicopter
lift. The new more mobile ground forces need to move by helicopter. 
The longer lines of communication on the battlefield need more
helicopters to lift personnel, ammunition, fuel and supplies. The
advent of modern attack helicopters will multiply again the support
helicopter lift requirement. Whether it is for relief operations,
special forces, conventional battle, clearing up after the war is
over, Northern Ireland operations, air mobile forces - wherever we
look we seem to need for helicopter lift. We are well served by our
Chinooks and Pumas - but the Wessex is long overdue for replacement.
We need to move forward with both more big lift and with the more
flexible smaller helicopters, which would also be particularly useful
for SF operations.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Conclusion</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>20.	Secretary of State this has been a race round a complex
subject. I have tried to look at the changing world and our security
needs in an objective way. We can meet those needs with lower force
levels overall, but the new requirements put a greater onus on the
ready availability of appropriate air power. We are compensating for
reduced numbers by giving more than one role to each aircraft type -
a trend which was already well under way - but is now vital given the
uncertainty of the nature of future operations. The Tornado GR1, for
example will be able to be used as a deep bomber, for reconnaissance,
for suppression of enemy air defences for attacking ships, for the
battlefield, as a tactical air-to-air refuelling aircraft, and as a
nuclear delivery system.  When EFA comes we will have similar
versatility in the air defence field, supplemented by its offensive
support role, while the Harrier will continue to provide its valuable
and unique contributions.  These added roles do of course bring extra
demands on the crews and training will remain demanding.  We shall of
course take what advantage we can from increased warning time, but as
I hope I have shown, you will want to know that you could call on
your air force at short notice to deter conflict, hold the line or
fight the war,whether in coalition or for national needs.</P>
