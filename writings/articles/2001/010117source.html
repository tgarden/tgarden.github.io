			<h3>Another couple of billion on defence equipment</h3>

			<p>In the apparently topsy turvey world of the Defence budget, the Services are near crisis point over training costs and retention bonuses while MOD announces that the UK is committing &pound;1.9 bn to the US Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) programme. The JSF is &quot;a strong contender&quot; to replace the Royal Navy Sea Harrier fleet and the RAF&#146;s Harrier GR7s sometime around 2012. Optimists believe this might be a requirement for 150 aircraft; but many can see no need for this quantity given that Eurofighter and Tornado will still be in service. Even if it were to be150 eventually, the memorandum of understanding (MOU) just signed equates to nearly &pound;13 million per aircraft just for joining the development phase.</p>
			<p>Why is the UK government prepared to spend so much? JSF is likely to be the best option  for the two new aircraft carriers which were announced in the Strategic Defence Review. Eurofighter looks as though it would be expensive to turn into a maritime version and would require very large carriers for its take off run. The hope is that a short take off version of JSF can be produced to keep the aircraft carrier size and cost down. There are also industrial benefits to UK. Some 70 British companies will be involved, and the money invested is designed to ensure that they get in at the start. If JSF becomes a world wide product replacing F16s this may prove to be a good punt.</p>
			<p>The real worry is whether JSF will happen at all. Perhaps it is merely coincidental that the MOU was signed in the dying days of the Clinton administration. There have been straws in the wind from the Bush camp that JSF may be for the chop. If the new administration&#146;s policy is to fight big wars only, then the JSF may seem a bit under par. They will also need to find the money for national missile defence. It is to be hoped that they make their position clear at an early stage before too much of the UK&#146;s development money has gone across the Atlantic. In any event our new aircraft carriers with their aircraft are going to be expensive: we shall have to hope there are some pilots left in the Services in ten years time.</p>
