<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Although the title of this conference is
Military Lessons from Kosovo, most of the action that is required
from those lessons is political rather than military. Whether it is
the question of preventative diplomacy, crisis management, rules of
engagement, offensive air strategy, end game negotiation, post
conflict reconstruction or restructuring capabilities, the military
lessons can only point in the general direction of how to be better
prepared next time. To implement some or all of those lessons will
require some difficult political decisions, just as the politics was
uppermost during the Kosovo crisis and operation. While European
countries can congratulate themselves on having kept their nerve
through a difficult campaign, they can hardly claim to have played a
starring role. You have covered the detailed military aspects earlier
in the day, and I shall focus on what the lessons for European
defence should be, and how we might work to getting some of them
implemented.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Lessons of the 90's</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The end of the Cold War left NATO with a
vast and expensive set of military forces, which had been training to
fight a single campaign for over 40 years. The planning assumptions
for an all out war in Europe were relatively simple. Yet in the
event, the decade of the 90's had more diverse military action by the
Western nations, under various banners, than at any time previously.
Kuwait, Iraq, Somalia, Rwanda, Bosnia, Haiti, Albania, Kosovo and
East Timor have seen western military force deployed to less than
benign environments. A new doctrine for peace support operations has
replaced the manuals on flexible response and the air-land battle in
the military staff colleges of the Alliance. However much of Europe's
force structure is still a hangover from the positional defence
requirement of the Cold War. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">This series of military experiences in the
Gulf, Rwanda, Bosnia, Somalia, Albania, Kosovo and East Timor, is
sufficient now to have established a strong consensus on the new
rationale for NATO, which was articulated in the Strategic Concept
launched at the NATO summit in Washington in April 1999. The
accumulation of data from real operations, rather than deterrence
postures, has highlighted major shortcomings in the security
capabilities available to the Alliance for these new tasks. </FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The 1999 Kosovo air campaign brought
together all the political and military lessons that had been learned
in the post Cold War operations. The US had expended a good deal of
research on improving its precision weapons. Nevertheless, the use of
laser designation remained a significant constraint if the target was
obscured by weather. The two other precision systems (GPS navigation
and TERCOM ground mapping) were available both in bombs and cruise
missiles, but were significantly more expensive and limited to fixed
targets. They required access to US national data. Nevertheless, this
mix of weaponry allowed the campaign to be planned on a requirement
for no casualties to NATO forces , and minimal collateral damage from
attacks. These constraints undoubtedly prolonged the air campaign,
but given that the required outcome was ultimately achieved, we can
expect future operations to have similar assumptions about the
requirement for very low numbers of casualties.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The contributions from the 14 NATO nations
which took part were varied as shown in figure 1 , but all were
overshadowed by the US, which provided 61% of the sorties flown . For
example, the UK carried out 1618 of the total of 38,004 NATO sorties
flown, or just over 4% . The sorties which directly influenced the
outcome were those carrying out offensive attacks, and here the total
UK effort was in the range 4% to 10% depending on the method of
calculation (the lower figure reflects munition numbers and the
higher missions flown) , and we know that in many of these cases it
was not possible to release weapons. From 1008 RAF bombing sorties
just 1011 weapons were released. Of these three quarters were
non-precision weapons. The story is similar for the other non-US NATO
air forces. However, the platform is only part of the question in
modern air campaigns. It has become very clear that in future
operations, precision weapons will be the norm. Figures for weapons
stocks are not readily available, but inferences can be drawn from
the data of weapon usage in the Kosovo air campaign. Only 250 of the
1011 UK aircraft weapons used were precision , and for France the
total was 582 laser guided bombs. The French Defence Ministry is
quoted as saying that they had an inadequate stockpile of such
weapons.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The US provided 70% of the total aircraft
and 80% of the total weapons delivered. Europe was shown to be good
at providing political support for the operation, but poorly equipped
to contribute to an offensive air campaign in an effective way.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">A comparison of US and EU capability</FONT>
</H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The United States Defence budget for 1998
was $267 bn from a GDP of $8.1 tr. Out of almost exactly the same
total GDP, the EU nations together spent some $173bn on defence or
64% of the US total. The US fields some 1.4 million professional
forces and almost as many ready reserves. The EU runs 1.8 million
troops of which 700,000 are conscripts and retains 3.6 million
reservists at various stages of readiness. These raw budget and
personnel statistics show clearly why Europe is so far behind the US
in its military hardware development. Europe fields more full time
troops, and very many more reservists, than the United States, yet
spends only half as much on defence. It is often claimed that the
major factor in differences in US and EU capabilities stems from an
all regular force in America being compared with a largely conscript
force in Europe. As can be seen from the figures, this is not the
main issue. If all conscription were eliminated, and two thirds of
the reservists were released, the EU could field over one million
professional soldiers,sailors and airmen. Adding in the 6 non-EU
European NATO members (Czech Republic,Hungary, Iceland, Norway,Poland
and Turkey) would raise the regular forces to almost exactly the 1.4
million of the United States and lift the total current European
aggregate defence spending to 70% of that in the US </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">If Europe, however defined, wishes to be a
more equal partner with the United States in its ability to intervene
internationally, it needs to spend its defence money differently. It
is currently trying to support far too large a number of regular
forces, conscripts and reserves on too few funds. This means that
little is available for funding research, development and the
procurement of equipment and weapon stocks. While the United States
is scarcely a perfect example of tight control of defence spending,
it is nevertheless achieving a different order of military capability
for its expenditure. This suggests that Europe needs either to raise
its defence spending, or reduce and restructure its forces to match
the current spending more effectively. It is unlikely that there will
be much political enthusiasm among nations for raising defence
expenditure, and it is therefore more sensible to look at how
European nations might work together at restructuring their military
forces to provide more appropriate capabilities to the likely demands
of the future.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Towards an EU Defence Capability</FONT>
</H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The development of a coherent defence policy
for the EU had been an area of great difficulty for most of the 90's.
The UK had been particularly unhelpful, fearing that any enhancement
of the EU's role would be at the expense of NATO cohesion. The logjam
was broken by the Anglo-French summit at St Malo in December 1998.
Despite having predicated the just completed UK defence review on a
continuing NATO-centred Atlanticist foreign policy, within six months
of its publication, Prime Minister Tony Blair was advocating a much
more significant role for Europe. The St Malo Declaration made it
clear that: "the Union must have the capacity for autonomous action,
backed up by credible military forces, the means to decide to use
them, and a readiness to do so, in order to respond to international
crises" . </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">This was a radical change of position for
the British and opened the way to the further developments in 1999 in
European defence. The Western European Union (WEU) had in the past
been seen as the main focus for European defence efforts. It had been
circumscribed in terms of access to capability, a lack of an adequate
planning staff, and a degree of uncertainty over the types of
operation that it could take on. The WEU ministerial meeting in
Bremen at the end of May 1999 took forward the thinking that had
started at St Malo and had been confirmed in Washington. The
apparently insurmountable difficulties of the differences in
membership between NATO, WEU and EU appeared to be no longer a
sticking point. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Cologne European Council Declaration,
the following month, put this into a wider context, but picked up the
same points, when they committed themselves in paragraph 2 </FONT>
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">"to further develop more
effective European military capabilities from the basis of existing
national, bi-national and multinational capabilities and to
strengthen our own capabilities for that purpose. This requires the
maintenance of a sustained defence effort, the implementation of the
necessary adaptations and notably the reinforcement of our
capabilities in the field of intelligence, strategic transport,
command and control." </FONT></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">It is significant that this was a
declaration by all 15 members including four neutral EU
countries.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Work continued in the UK to keep up the pace
of European defence developments. The Anglo-Italian declaration of 20
July 1999 produced some concrete proposals on what needed to be done.
It widened the requirement from a need for an EU capacity for doing
its own humanitarian, crisis management and peace support operations
(the Petersberg tasks). The need for a more effective European role
in NATO was promoted as a clear lesson from Kosovo. The declaration
proposed a peer review process with meetings of EU Foreign and
Defence Ministers twice a year to check progress towards the agreed
goals. This would take place in parallel with NATO's Defence
Capabilities Initiative (DCI) work. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In November 1999, the first joint meeting of
EU Foreign and Defence Ministers took place with Javier Solana, the
new EU high representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, in
the chair. They looked at how Europe might be more effective in the
defence field and in particular provide capabilities for Kosovo-like
crises. A further Anglo-French summit occurred in the same month,
when the two main defence players in Europe launched their vision for
a new rapid deployment force of up to 60,000 men. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">All this work was brought together at the EU
Summit in Helsinki on 10/11 December 1999. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The more detailed Annex spells out the
scale, types and readiness of the forces which are proposed.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">To develop European
capabilities, Member States have set themselves the headline goal: by
the year 2003, cooperating together voluntarily, they will be able to
deploy rapidly and then sustain forces capable of the full range of
Petersberg tasks as set out in the Amsterdam Treaty, including the
most demanding, in operations up to corps level (up to 15 brigades or
50,000-60,000 persons).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">These forces should be militarily
self-sustaining with the necessary command, control and intelligence
capabilities, logistics, other combat support services and
additionally, as appropriate,air and naval elements. Member States
should be able to deploy in full at this level within 60 days, and
within this to provide smaller rapid response elements available and
deployable at very high readiness. They must be able to sustain such
a deployment for at least one year. This will require an additional
pool of deployable units (and supporting elements) at lower readiness
to provide replacements for the initial forces.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Member States have also decided to develop
rapidly collective capability goals in the fields of command and
control, intelligence and strategic transport, areas also identified
by the WEU audit.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">They welcome in this respect decisions
already announced by certain Member States which go in that
direction:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">- to develop and coordinate monitoring and
early warning military means;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">- to open existing joint national
headquarters to officers coming from other Member States;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">- to reinforce the rapid reaction
capabilities of existing European multinational forces;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">- to prepare the establishment of a European
air transport command;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">- to increase the number of readily
deployable troops;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">- to enhance strategic sea lift
capacity.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">We have now, in theory, an outline plan for
progress in improving European defence capabilities in a way which
works with the grain of NATO. That is a remarkable step forward given
the reluctance of the US and the UK in past years to address these
issues. But there are many difficulties ahead. The institutional
arrangements will almost certainly delay the development of the
agreed capability. Nevertheless, there are a number of measures that
might be taken, which would make practical sense in any case.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">What military power does Europe
need?</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The UK Government has taken the need for
restructuring as a strong lesson of the Kosovo operation in its
lesson learned White Paper:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">...... in co-operation with
our Allies, we need to examine ways in which member states can
increase their qualitative and quantitative military contribution to
NATO's overall capabilities. The priority lies in such areas as
precision attack weapons, secure communications and strategic
movement assets. Interoperability of systems will, of course, be a
key component of this. </FONT></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The key elements for early work in improving
European capability are contained in this analysis. Readiness,
deployability and sustainability are identified as prime drivers for
force structures. Precision attack weapons, secure communications and
strategic movement assets are highlighted as areas for priority work.
There are significant implications for air power in all of these six
issues. Europe needs to completely restructure its expensive, but
unusable, military capability to meet these challenges. The funds
provided for defence purposes throughout Europe are unlikely to
increase without a significant change in threat perception. This
means that restructuring of capabilities will need to be achieved
within broadly the same resource assumptions as today. Thus, a
balance will need to be struck between the different elements of the
joint force structure. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Approaches to Improving European Defence
Capabilities</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In any discussion about improving European
defence capabilities, the argument usually begins with a plea for
more spending on defence. It is also argued that greater integration
of defence industries would be beneficial. Neither approach has much
prospect of early success, and there can be no confidence that either
would generate real enhancements in capability without a radical
restructuring. Putting aside the political difficulties, Europe could
undoubtedly organise its defence spending more efficiently if it was
done on an integrated basis in the same way that the United States
organises its armed forces at the Federal level. Such an approach for
Europe will not be possible for many years (if ever), as it will
necessary for EU member nations to give up national sovereignty to
what is currently an unacceptable extent. There are similar, although
slightly less acute, difficulties with moves towards allocation of
military tasks to particular nations. This "Role Specialisation" was
much studied during the later stages of the Cold War. Even with a
common view of the mission, nations were reluctant to become reliant
on other Allies for particular capabilities. Nevertheless a de facto
specialisation has occurred as European nations have been unable to
match the technology of the US. It may be that there will be a
greater willingness for each European nation to undertake fewer
roles, but make those that they field more effective. This approach
will require close co-ordination if it is not to open up yet more
gaps in capability.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The proposals agreed at the 1999 Helsinki
Summit could provide an appropriate mechanism for co-ordinating
efforts between EU nations, and also keeping less enthusiastic
contributors up to the mark. It would allow nations to move towards
as much specialisation as they felt comfortable with, and to be
credited with real military contribution to the EU force
component.However this will take some years to develop. In the
meantime there is a danger that European capability will degrade
further. What is needed is some early action to improve capability
without assuming large budget increases. This can only be achieved by
looking for ways to reduce nugatory expenditure by cutting
duplication, unnecessary support overheads, and inappropriate
capability. This is a painful process even when carried out on a
national basis. It will be yet more difficult if it is to be carried
out on an EU basis. Nevertheless, it is the only immediate option
available, and can be done relatively rapidly given the political
will. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">If we look at the European forces as a
whole, we see duplication of headquarters, planning, training,
logistics support, procurement, research, bases and other facilities.
This would be bad enough if the scale of the frontline in each nation
justified the scale of the support infrastructure, but it does not in
nearly all cases. Opportunities for more effective operation of
European military forces are apparent in land, sea and air
capabilities. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Near Term EU Military
Rationalisation</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In looking for opportunities to provide more
effective European military power, the leap is too often made towards
a full scale integrated European army. Indeed the Helsinki proposals
are in danger of trying to achieve this step, which remains
impossible unless the EU becomes a much more politically integrated
entity. In the near term (the next 5 years), it would be much more
productive to look for opportunities to rationalise forces in being
which can be operated more efficiently on a multilateral or EU-wide
basis. The model for such a supranational activity is the NATO AWACs
force, which has successfully provided an airborne early warning
capability to NATO members at much lower day-to-day operating cost
than would have been the case if operated on an individual national
basis. At a lower level the Dutch/Belgian joint naval headquarters or
the Nordic logistics battalion in Bosnia show other successful
approaches to rationalisation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In work that I have been doing over the past
two years, we have looked where it would be practical for European
nations to produce better capability for no greater cost by pooling.
This is to me the major lesson for European defence after Kosovo. The
vast amounts of money being poured into national defences are not
producing useful military capability. The Germans have been leading
with suggestions for an EU air transport force and this is certainly
an obvious early candidate. Pooling of C130 Hercules would be
relatively easily achieved. Air o air refuelling is another good
example. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Reconnaissance and Combat Search and Rescue
(CSAR) are two roles, which are expensive in equipment and training,
but which could offer opportunities for building up EU capabilities
to operate with the US forces available to NATO. There will be
considerable development in the use of UAVs for the tactical
reconnaissance role, and there is a need for a European
satellite-based strategic reconnaissance capability. Both of these
capabilities will be expensive, but are essential if Europe is
serious in its intention to provide real military capability. The
information exploitation organisation will again be much more
cost-effective if operated at the supranational level. This
capability needs to be considered in the context of an EU
intelligence capability, which given the political, military and
financial complexities is dealt with below as part of medium term
integration.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">None of the air transport, air tanker,
reconnaissance or CSAR pooling proposals would undermine national
capability. Indeed for the smaller nations it would both increase
available capability and reduce costs. It is thus possible to see
opportunities for enhancing the support element of air power in
Europe in a relatively short timescale through aggressive
rationalisation of forces in being, and exploiting the moves towards
public-private partnerships. Significant defence funds would be
released provided that nations took the consequent manpower and
infrastructure savings which would flow. There would remain a problem
of the "free-rider" nation, although the audit and capability
criteria proposals of the Helsinki Summit may help to stimulate
contributions from EU member nations. At an early stage, it will be
necessary to establish a European Defence Budget to which members
contribute either capability or money.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Medium Term European Integration</FONT>
</H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">While the support area offers opportunities
for pooling and rationalisation of air power forces without too many
issues of national sovereignty, real increases in capability will
need a similar approach to combat air power. It is unlikely that
major EU defence players will be attracted to giving up their combat
capabilities to a supranational authority until some confidence has
been gained through the less contentious pooling of air transport and
air-to-air refuelling capability. Here F16s, Tornados and
Eurofighters provided common equipments for pooled operation.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The development of an EU precision attack
capability would be a key part of this medium term plan. The
provision of adequate stocks of appropriate munitions would allow
nations to contribute in other ways than just aircraft and aircrew.
Starting the process early would allow a common view to emerge about
the platform/weapons combination which should be developed. Leaving
France, Germany, Italy and the UK to research their own future
offensive capability will inevitably result in a sub-optimal
solution. A united EU view on both the importance and the nature of
the next generation offensive air power requirement would be a very
powerful driver towards procuring an effective capability. There is
time for this process to begin, provided that nations start to
operate in this role together. Under the current arrangements, Europe
is likely to perpetuate the mix of sytems of limited effectiveness in
the offensive role.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">One of the more expensive capabilities is
provided by the aircraft carrier. Few European nations can afford to
field such a force; for those which stay in the role, the opportunity
costs are very high. The UK plans to provide 2 carriers in 2012, and
it likely that France, Spain and Italy will wish to retain the role
as well. Operated on a national level, one or two carriers do not
constitute a viable and reliable force, and the opportunity costs are
severe for other defence capabilities. The timescale is sufficiently
long for interested EU nations to look at how they might jointly
contribute to a force of 5 or 6 aircraft carriers with their
supporting ships and aircraft. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Intelligence requirements permeate every
aspect of military operations, and an independent Intelligence
capability will be needed if EU forces are to be able to operate
truly autonomously. Pooling of current intelligence related air power
capabilities will be difficult for a number of reasons. The equipment
used by nations is diverse, and much of it outdated; the national
exploitation is jealously guarded; and there are bilateral
difficulties with wider information sharing. For these reasons, it
would probably be more effective to build up a new EU intelligence
capability from scratch. This would be expensive, but would allow a
fully integrated modern system to be established relatively quickly.
If the EU wanted to focus on one area for priority action, then
Intelligence would provide it. The platforms, communication, fusion,
exploitation and dissemination systems could be built up to be fully
interoperable with NATO, but also independently usable. Kosovo showed
that the inability to share digital intelligence data was a problem
throughout the operation. </FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000">Conclusion</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">This conference has addressed a number of
key tri-Service issues in terms of future capabilities. If Europe is
to be able to take part in any meaningful way in future Kosovos, it
must do something about getting better and more appropriate military
capability for its defence spending. The moves towards a more
co-operative approach between European nations is welcome, but
Helsinki goals may founder on the need for more defence money. An
approach like the UK SDR at the EU level could do much to fill in
those capability gaps at no greater cost, but would require more
political courage than is likely to be available for some years. In
the meantime, we should look for relatively minor improvements that
can be made through cost-effective pooling of European
capabilities.</FONT></P>
