<H3><CENTER>Air Power  Confronts an Unstable World </CENTER></H3>

<ADDRESS><CENTER>edited by Dr Richard P Hallion ( Brassey's, London
1997), 247pp &#163;25.</CENTER></ADDRESS>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>A new collection of essays on aspects of air power is bound to
contain something of interest to any airman. Dr Hallion, an American
Air force historian has written many books on aerospace history, and
he has brought together nine writers who are well known for their
practical as well as academic interest in air power policy and
doctrine. Yet , as is often the case with edited collections, the
book lacks a coherent message. </P>

<P>The title begs a number of questions which needed to be addressed.
While each of the essays is of interest, most seem to imagine a world
where a capability for precision bombing is the self-evident key to
future global stability. Barry Watts rightly questions the degree to
which superior technology necessarily guarantees combat success. He
looks at the lessons of the Vietnam war, but similar questions hang
over the inability of superior air power to give victory to the
Russians in Afghanistan, or the French in Algeria. There are wars,
like the Gulf War (which is endlessly cited by the writers in this
volume), where air power will be the determining factor; but are such
conflicts the most likely future scenarios? </P>

<P>Tony Mason makes a thoughtful case for the utility of air power in
operations other than war. He analyses the Bosnian lessons and also
looks at humanitarian and constabulary roles for air power. As John
Warden  explains in a short concluding essay, the world is different
because of the dominance of the United States in general, and its air
power in particular. He argues that "In the big sweep of future
history, nothing could be more important than for the United States
to maintain its global stability-inducing dominance."  Such dominance
makes old style inter-state wars less probable, and hence reduces the
incentive for nations to invest in expensive air capabilities. Warden
offers some speculative thoughts on future air power roles to prevent
natural disasters. These include preemptive strikes against
volcanoes, and counter-asteroid missions. He concludes that "If we
refuse to accept the challenges and continue to live in a long-gone
world of flying scarves, our relevance will fade rapidly, and with it
our hope for the future".  The book could have done with more such
looking forward to what the world's future needs might be, rather
than assuming that new air power technology is by definition able to
contribute to future stability.</P>
