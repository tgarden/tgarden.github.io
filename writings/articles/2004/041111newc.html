			<h4>New Security Challenges and Old Military Thinking</h4>
			&nbsp;The Newcastle University Annual Military Lecture - 11 November 2004</div>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>The Security Challenges</h3>
			<p>First then what are these world challenges that we face? The EU agreed a common view in its Global Security strategy paper of last December. And if we look to the United Nations, or the much criticised US National security strategy of September 2002, or NATO&rsquo;s thinking at the Prague summit of December 2002, we find common themes in each. Despite the tremendous successes of recent years in moving towards more democratic states, there remain parts of the world where either government is not functioning, or where totalitarian regimes still hold sway. At the same time, there is the growing threat from those who owe no allegiance to any state, but operate outside the rule of law, and can use terror as their weapon.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>We face problems of international crime; of corruption which undermines democracy; of poverty in much of the world; of declining natural resources be it fish, oil or water; of environmental damage of which global warming is the most acute; of population growths in poorly governed regions; and of disease returning and spreading through global travel.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Some of these factors make conflict more likely, and all of them need concerted action by the global community. The European Union is well suited to taking on these tasks, although it could be still better. However, the EU remains less effective when trying to meet the challenges at the hard end of security. These challenges come from undemocratic states developing powerful new weapons, with which they hope to deter intervention by the international community. They also come from extremists who combine a willingness to die for their cause, with a wish to maximise the terror and destruction on their enemies. And, they come from the strife within weak countries, which can lead to mass refugees, who look for help from the rich nations of the world.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>The changing world</h3>
			<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
			<p>The 1990s were a key decade in the emergence of a new international security structure. The end of the Cold War, the reunification of Germany, the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union, and the accession of former Warsaw Pact members&nbsp; into NATO, followed by the enlargement of the EU have completely transformed Europe's security.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>It might have been assumed that the disappearance of a real and urgent military threat from the Soviet Union would have decreased the military activity of western nations. Yet North American and European armed forces have been engaged in more real military operations in this decade than they were in the four decades of the Cold War.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The Gulf War of 1991 seemed to set the new agenda for the international community. The effects of the break-up of the Former Republic of Yugoslavia have given us a series of challenges, - Bosnia, Kosovo, Macedonia - and the stabilisation process is not yet finished. East Timor, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, Bunia in the Congo have been a new adventures in humanitarian interventions.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Less positive has been the emergence of India and Pakistan as nuclear powers. The development of North Korea in the nuclear weapons field, and its continuing hair trigger relationship with South Korea remains a danger. We now have concerns about Iran's nuclear programme. Taiwan remains a potential flashpoint. Perhaps most significant has been our inability to bring about a stable Palestinian state living in harmony with Israel.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Many had hoped that the new millennium would bring a much greater emphasis on human and individual rights by the major democratic powers. But the attacks on the Washington and New York on 11 September 2001 have changed the direction of our approach to security once more.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>In any examination of world challenges, the attitude of the United States is always the key factor. We in Europe worry if America appears to be going isolationist, and we worry if it seems, as is currently the case, to be&nbsp; moving to being too unilateralist and interventionist. Since 9/11 we have seen the switch from universal support for operations against al-Qaeda in Afghanistan to international disarray over intervention in Iraq.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>Traditional Institutions</h3>
			<p align="left">To deal with this new set of security challenges, we inevitably have to work with the tools that we have to hand.&nbsp; The United Nations is imperfect and has no immediate forces to call upon. NATO has declined in significance over the past five years as the US has been less willing to accept the constraints of Alliance operations. The new developments in European defence and foreign policy are still at an early stage, and more effort has gone into institutional issues than into developing usable and useful capabilities.</p>
			<p></p>
			<h3>NATO &amp; Old Military thinking</h3>
			<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
			<p>When it comes to security problems in Europe, we tend to think still of NATO. Last week in The Guardian, Jonthan Steele argued that it was time to terminate NATO. I responded on Wednesday with a letter defending the continuing importance of NATO. But I am not uncritical of the organisation. It is to some extent the fount of the Old Military Thinking which I put in my title.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The diplomatic machinations over Iraq were very bruising for NATO. Afghanistan had shown the future: the US expects to lead coalitions of the willing. In any event, there would have been little chance of consensus among member states over mounting a NATO operation. Even with&nbsp; a sidelined role, the divisions between the various national players managed to cause excitement. NATO found itself in difficulties over authorisation for planning for the defence of Turkey in the event of a conflict in Iraq. The diplomatic temperature rose as France, Germany and Belgium saw themselves being pressured into giving a stamp of approval for US early moves on Iraq. To general surprise, Turkey in the end did not allow ground operations to be launched against Iraq from its territory. There were no attacks by Iraq on Turkey. Nevertheless, the concern in NATO was real, and the public name calling between members was undoubtedly damaging.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Iraq reinforced questions about the future relevance of NATO. The Alliance has had a remarkable success over the past decade in the way that it has stabilised the Balkans. It has also done great work in its programme of enlargement, which has brought greater stability to Europe.&nbsp; At Prague in late 2002, the commitments by member states to a new NATO Response Force seemed to be accepting that the Alliance needed to be able to spearhead high intensity operations in distant parts at short notice. NATO providing the stabilising force in Afghanistan is already working well beyond its traditional area of&nbsp; interest.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>There remains a tension between the practice of deploying NATO on post-conflict tasks, and the rhetoric of successive Alliance summits, which look for the most modern warfighting capabilities. Some European members suspect that the US sees NATO as a useful forum to encourage individual members to update&nbsp; capabilities. This then allows coalitions of the willing to be built through bi-lateral arrangements. The NATO role becomes little more than setting equipment standards and sharing military doctrine. There is a tension between NATO's drive for nations to procure precision offensive weaponry and network centric warfare capabalities, while investment in these capabilities may be at the expense of the troops that are proving so vital after the fighting is over. I shall return to this when I discuss the UK military.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3 align="left">ESDP</h3>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>There are times when the interests of the US and Europe may be different. We recognise that in the trade negotiations, but are only now developing a more independent&nbsp; line within the foreign and security policy area.</p>
			<p>Our leaders have recognised the need for a stronger Europe in the defence field. The historic Franco-British summit at St Malo in 1998 ended decades of UK obstruction over European defence co-operation. From that meeting stemmed a series of developments which gave a real impetus to the development of European capabilities to underpin the development of Common Foreign and Security Policy.</p>
			<p>The Helsinki Summit of 1999 provided real goals for deployable military capability: an EU force of up to 60,000, which could be deployed within two months, and sustained for a year to meet crisis management and humanitarian type tasks. Both France and the UK have been restructuring their military forces so that they can undertake these new tasks, and needed to be in the lead together to encourage the rest of Europe.</p>
			<p>Since St Malo, there have been ups and downs. I much regret that in 1999, the opportunity was missed to bring France back into the fold as a fully participating member of the integrated military structure of NATO. Many of the specious arguments about European defence undermining NATO could have been more easily laid to rest. But perhaps more importantly, NATO would have been stronger and Europe would be a more equal partner with the US. I think that there are also particular problems in pushing forward sensible European defence capabilities as hard as we might.</p>
			<p>A common perception of the importance of national sovereignty in security seems to me to be at the heart of many of our difficulties at working togetherin meeting the global challenges. There is no doubt that we face, and this particularly the case in the UK, great difficulties in convincing our electorates that sharing sovereignty in defence and foreign policy is a good thing.</p>
			<p>Let me briefly explain why I believe it is becoming essential. The reasons are economic, political and military effectiveness.</p>
			<p>First, let me make the economic argument for rationalization of defence capabilities at the European level. The costs of any armed forces divide broadly into three parts: people, equipment and running costs. The costs of people in a professional military rise in line with commercial companies wages &#150; faster than general inflation. The costs of military equipment rise at an even higher rate because of the small numbers involved, the high technological risk, and inefficiencies of the market.&nbsp; The only element of a defence budget which matches normal inflation is that of infrastructure running costs (provided we don&rsquo;t fight too many wars). Thus unless defence spending rises faster than inflation, any long term programme becomes unsustainable.</p>
			<p>In Britain we have a great fanfare of trumpets about every three or four years and announce a new approach to defence, which at the same time covers reductions in ships, tanks, aircraft and people. We are in just such a situation currently. Of course we rationalize as much as we can internally to limit the damage to our forces. France and the UK have done more of such rationalization than many others in Europe, and so our ability to make further moves in this direction are much more limited than say Germany. Rationalisation at the European level would offer one way out of this economic bind.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Next let me look at the political importance of working more closely together in defence. We share a belief in the international system, and do not think it either fair or sensible to leave the solution to the world&rsquo;s problems to one nation, even one as benign and rich as the United States. The US makes no secret of the driving rationale for its foreign policy: it is US national interests. These may sometimes be the same as Europe&rsquo;s or the UK&rsquo;s &#150; but they may not, as we often see in trade negotiations. In Europe, we may agree with the US about the nature of the threats, but we have different views on how to deal with those threats. Sometimes a short term response can make you feel good, but merely make the long term problem worse. I would argue that this may be the case with Iraq, only time will tell.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>If we wish to be able to share our security approaches with the US to come to best approaches, we need to operate with them as serious players. The UK tries to do this by public support and private debate &#150; not very successfully in recent times I would argue. France and Germany took a different approach, and I would argue were equally unsuccessful. Together, and within the context of the EU, we would operate as a much more powerful grouping, provided that we had also provided ourselves with the necessary military capabilities to follow through. So there is a political need for much closer work in this field.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>My third rationale is that of effectiveness. We are throwing money away on our armed forces as they are currently structured. The &euro;180 bn that the 25 EU members spend on defence is a little under half the US spending. It buys a tiny fraction of US military capabilities. Why? Because it is split between 25 armies, and almost as many airforces and&nbsp; navies, all with headquarters, logistic organizations, training structures. The waste is beyond comprehension. Some governments may realize that more spending means more waste rather than more capability, and this is another element of the overall decline.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Of course a fully integrated European defence capability is many decades away &#150; if it ever comes to pass. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that there is nothing that can be done. We need to make moves now &#150; and France and the UK need to be in the lead.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3><b>The Way Ahead</b></h3>
			<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
			<p>We need to examine where we could together provide military capability on a shared basis which would provide more bang for the euro. There have been some very positive developments just recently. The establishment of the European Defence Agency can act as a broker for this work in time. The new EU battle groups as a concept, and perhaps the new Goals for 2010. Certainly I detect much greater enthusiasm and flexibility in the EU military staffs than in their colleagues in NATO. That said, we have problems which are exemplified by the unwillingness of EU nations to contribute forces to help secure Afghanistan.</p>
			<p>Nevertheless, the prognosis for deeper integration in EU defence is good as long as France and Britain with Germany can set the pace. There would of course be national benefits in lower costs, but if they are to benefit Europe&rsquo;s wider security needs, the savings must be used to procure the missing capabilities. This can only happen if the EU moves forward with some form of defence budget. All EU members must choose whether to contribute to their common agreed needs either with capabilities or with cash.</p>
			<p>Military power is not the only requirement to meet the new global challenges &#150; but it is the area in which Europe is failing.</p>
			<h3>Homeland Security</h3>
			<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
			<p>There is also a need once more for the UK and other western democracies to provide security for their citizens at home.&nbsp; The threats of large scale casualties and damage to the economy are real as 9/11 and Madrid have shown. Yet the current division of labour between military forces for overseas actions and emergency services for home defence is unlikely to provide the greatest safety for our citizens. Security needs a coherent short, medium and long term strategy which provides for prevention, consequence management and reduction in support for terrorism world wide.</p>
			<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
			<h3><b>The British Military</b></h3>
			<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
			<p>The UK must work with allies to provide for common security. This will involve contributions to NATO, EU forces, UN peacekeeping, coalitions of the willing and also security at home. The British force concept of operations in Iraq has differed from - and been more successful than - the American approach. In the same way, we need to ensure that we can influence the strategy for these diverse international problems. This will mean working with the rest of Europe as much as with the US. It will also mean taking a closer look at the balance of resources between Defence, FCO, DfID and the traditional emergency services at home. The current direction of UK Defence Policy is not helpful in this respect.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>A rational approach to UK Defence Policy would look to share the burden more efficiently with EU partners, provide an emergency response at home, and focus on our strengths in stabilisation abroad. If this means leaving more of the high technology offensive capabilities to the US, then that may be the price that has to be paid.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
			<p>This has been a grand sweep around the many security challenges that we face, and yet I have not addressed the perhaps more important problems of environment, poverty, resources and disease which can lead to conflict as well as misery in their own right. Military thinking needs to change. Buying big expensive toys which support ailing national defence industries may no longer be sensible if it means fewer soldiers, policemen, and intelligence gatherers to tackle instability. There are few places left for old fashioned wars, and the US has such overpowering offensive capabilities, that we are all bit players in such operations. Our strengths in Europe and the UK play to preventing conflict and its causes. We can be proud of that, and see it every day around the globe where British forces are deployed.</p>
