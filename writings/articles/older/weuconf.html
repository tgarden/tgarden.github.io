Co-ordination</B></CENTER></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>While I have been asked to introduce this session on the problems
of European Coordination in the context of European force structures,
I shall use as much of my time to outline my thoughts on possible
solutions. We can all describe the problems, which revolve around a
lack of coherent security policy and a lack of effective military
capability,  and they are too often taken as an excuse for inaction
and lack of progress. I shall examine the major problem areas as I
see them, and then indicate where is see opportunities to overcome
these supposed difficulties.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Europe is an economic power, but it is a long way from being a
strategic power. To be a strategic power requires two key elements: a
clear and coherent foreign policy, and the diplomatic and military
means to implement that foreign policy. Europe currently has neither.
For the 21st Century we must ask first whether we want Europe to
become a strategic power. For myself, but not necessarily for most
people in Britain, the answer must be yes. It seems inconceivable to
me that a region which is as rich and populous as the United States,
particularly after the start of monetary union, can expect to
continue its foreign and security policy on either an exclusively
national basis or only through NATO.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>We see the limitations of the European position today as we try to
deal with the Balkans. Even for a tragedy on our doorstep, we must
look to the USA to provide the lead and the major military
capabilities. We must shape our strategy for Europe always mindful of
how it will play in Congress. We see this now as we debate the use of
ground troops in Kosovo. NATO is important, but we cannot be sure
that it will always be there to save us from ourselves.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The primary problem then is how do we develop a European Foreign
and Security Policy which is underpinned by the necessary diplomatic
and military capability to implement it. We need a design which
maintains NATO but gives us a European capability to protect and
promote European vital interests.The arguments too often revolve
around the institutional debates. The confusion of acronyms and
organisations. The linkages between NATO, WEU, and the EU, coupled
with debates over second and fourth pillars, do little to advance the
military capability.</P>

<P>A recent analysis by the Brookings Institution claims that
"despite spending two thirds of what the United States does on
defense, European NATO countries have less than 10 per cent of the
transportable defense capability for prompt long range action." In
the Kosovo operation, we have seen that these statistics are real:
the almost total reliance on US capability, with the European nations
each providing quite small capabilities. Hopes for fixing the
problems of European defence capability currently centre on each
nation modernising their military on a national basis. I believe that
we are more likely to be able to improve Europe's defence
effectiveness by eliminating unnecessary duplication through
progressively seeking European, rather than national, capabilities.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The development of the common defence policy for the European
Union, like the United Kingdom's recent strategic defence review,
must be foreign policy led. The scale and the scope of the armed
forces would be determined by the objectives of foreign policy
developed within the CFSP, while ensuring that members of the North
Atlantic Alliance could meet their NATO obligations. This would not
lead to any decoupling of European countries from their NATO
undertakings. Nor should there be any duplication of the critical
contribution to military co-operation provided by NATO, namely its
command structures and headquarters, although certain developments of
'double-hatting' could take place. The most effective way for the
members of the European Union to "get more deployable forces for a
euro" is by systematically developing economies of scales in the
support, training and operational management of their armed forces.
Let me add that I do not for one moment believe that more than very
minor role-specialisation is either likely or desirable.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>There are two approaches whereby duplication between European
armed forces could be eliminated and additional resources made
available for increased force effectiveness. One would be in the
common development of new common capabilities, and the other is the
development of common support and logistic services. An existing
Alliance example of the first approach is the common procurement and
operation by fourteen allies of the AWACS (airborne early warning and
control) aircraft. An example of the second approach is the way that
four Nordic countries providing troops to IFOR/SFOR are supported by
a common logistic battalion. The agreement by the Netherlands and
Belgian navies to develop common headquarters and support services
for their fleets is an hopeful sign that some European states have
made a start to the elimination of expensive duplication.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In attempting to identify early candidates for common procurement,
the fact that the armed forces of different countries want new tanks
or new fighter aircraft at different times will be raised as a major
objection. This can best be solved by at first concentrating on new
projects on which there is a widely shared common requirement and
where the technology is relatively mature.  As an aside, I should say
that I do not argue that a common European single defence industry
will help. I believe that the efforts expended on this idea are
almost entirely nugatory. If we were to end up with a single European
defence industry, all governments would feel obliged to buy from it
and we would have poor value for money with no competition. The
second approach will be a systematic analysis of support and logistic
services to see where these could be provided on a Europe wide basis
or for a group of countries procuring a common item of equipment.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>An immediate example is the Medium Scale Transport Aircraft, for
which common tenders are being sought by seven European countries, as
well as the proposed large Strategic Air Lift projects. These are two
examples where common procurement and common operation could be
considered. A reduction in the number of operating bases required
would lead to much greater cost effectiveness. These could become
early examples of European Force Elements. The development of a
common European flight refuelling service could also be examined. In
the longer term the common support and servicing of helicopters could
make sense. The Eurofighter, already ordered by five countries, could
provide a trial for a number of these concepts. Perhaps even more
exciting is the possibility of common outsourcing to civilian firms
for some capabilities. The air transport might be provided in this
manner.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In the marine environment one can cumulate existing capacities and
provide common supply services, possibly leading to a rationalisation
of the number of European naval bases. Fleet auxiliaries can be
envisaged as developing a common European service. An early candidate
as one of the European Force Elements, would be a European mine
counter measure service. The principle could be applied to larger
ships. France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom all wish to have
some aircraft carrier capability; could it be provided by a common
squadron thereby providing savings in support and logistic chains,
while also ensuring that a viable force was available at all times? A
European led Combined Joint Task Force in the maritime environment at
present lacks a satisfactory headquarters ship; one, or more, of
these could be acquired on a common basis.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>It would make sense to begin the approach to land forces by
looking at engineers, communications, transport and medical services,
which could provide the first common programmes. The wider field of
logistic support could follow and an early candidate would be the
development of common IT systems for logistics. The question of
outsourcing logistic and support services is now under active
consideration in a number of European countries. There would be
economies through the working out of common specifications and the
use of a limited number of common suppliers. Success in these areas
would enable a subsequent application of the approach of European
Force Elements to artillery, armour and infantry units.</P>

<P>There are some force elements which are provided jointly
to&nbsp;all armed services. Some of these, like protection against
nuclear, biological and chemical warfare, are obvious candidates for
common provision. Others, such as intelligence and mapping, are more
difficult because of traditional transatlantic patterns of
co-operation, but it would be a mistake for the development of a
separable NATO for any capability to depend on a single ally, even
the United States.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>These examples suggest some areas where the development of
European Force Elements and common support and logistic services
could provide building blocks for the strengthening of European
defence capabilities by the more effective use of European defence
budgets through the removal of the cost overhang of separate support
systems. Many argue that one of the problems is the reduction in
national defence budgets. I see the problem differently. It is the
problem that currently nations can see defence as a free good
provided predominantly by the US taxpayer. If we develop common
European budgeting arrangements for defence then nations will have a
choice: either contribute capability or cash.Since there are both
industrial and employment advantages in contributing capability, we
would see an increase willingness to support European defence
capability. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The time has now come to move forward with practical steps to
develop a European Defence Capability. It will take time, perhaps
many years, but a start must be made. It does not necessarily mean
greater expenditure: much can be done with better use of current
resources. None of the problems are as difficult as those of monetary
union or enlargement. What is needed is a long term vision for
defence at the European level coupled with progressive measures now
to make it achievable.</P>
