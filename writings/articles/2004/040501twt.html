			<h1>NATO at the Olympics?</h1>
			<p>Tim Garden</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><i>&quot;</i><i>NATO can assist, NATO will assist, NATO is in a position&nbsp; to assist</i><i>,&quot; Nato Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer in Athens on 20 February 2004.</i></p>
			<p><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p>
			<p>Despite all the arguments across the Atlantic, and those between &quot;new&quot; and &quot;old&quot; Europe, NATO seems to be the international community&rsquo;s favourite answer to every problem. Not only troubleshooting the Balkans, Afghanistan, Iraq and even perhaps Israel-Palestine eventually, NATO is now being invited by the Greeks to help with security for the Olympic Games this summer. The world is desperate to return to a feeling of safety and security, and perhaps it is inevitable that the only working military alliance should find itself in such demand in these uncertain times. The question is how much can it realistically do, and how much is it reasonable to expect it to undertake.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;Yet we have this powerful grouping of countries which have banded together for mutual protection. Surely, they can use NATO in some way for direct action in preventing terrorism? This certainly appears to be the thinking of the Greek government in its request for NATO assistance for the 2004 Olympic Games. Terrorists seek easy targets, which will attract wide publicity. They may want to attack the interests of particular countries. For al Qaeda and related extremist movements, the Olympics will pose a tempting target set. There will be large crowds, overstretched security forces, international media coverage, and people from every nation on earth. The Greek authorities face a daunting prospect in providing security. As a member of NATO, they ought to be able to expect to share the problem with allies, and produce a collective response. But, it is not as easy as that.</p>
			<h3>Policing</h3>
			<div align="left">
				<p>In the UK, when the military is need for counter terrorism tasks at home, they operate under the command of the police. This recognises that the range of actions that need to be taken are essentially those which police forces can best do. The military can provide some unique capabilities, extra manpower and heavier protection, but they are not experts in detecting and preventing criminal activity. If a terror outrage happens, then the military can provide help to the rescue and emergency services. Again their efforts are best directed by the civil emergency commander on the ground. The liaison arrangements are important, and the line of command needs to be clear. While practices vary in different countries, the principles are sound.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>For the Olympics, the Greek authorities will need to be very clear in what they expect from a NATO component. Also NATO troops will need to know the command chain and how it works. For these reasons, it may not be sensible to think of NATO going in on the ground and trying to act as a sub unit of the Greek police force, or even worse an independent security force. Proposals for using NATO in the air to monitor air threats with AWACS are more&nbsp; appropriate. Similarly defending the coast from the sea will be a capability which NATO could deploy. It may be that some NATO nations could help with signals intelligence assets to intercept potential terrorist communications. However, it is more likely that such support would be done on a bilateral basis rather than in the wider arena of NATO.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Following the attacks of 9/11, NATO has set up some capabilities which may prove useful. Operation Active Endeavour (OAE) was launched on 18 October 2001. It provides maritime surveillance and monitoring in the Mediterranean. More than 41,000 ships have been tracked during the operation. An expansion in OAE was announced in March 2004, and will allow NATO to help protect the Olympics from terrorist attack from the sea.</p>
				<p></p>
				<h3>Aftermath</h3>
				<p>Sadly, the area in which NATO capabilities could prove most useful are in coping with the aftermath of a terrorist attack. NATO could provide a quick reaction force to deal with the consequences of a major attack. Helicopters, medical troops, decontamination specialists, and engineers may all be needed if things go wrong. Putting together such a capability would be useful for the whole of Europe. The Madrid bombing of March 2004 showed that the attacks may occur anywhere. While national police forces are better placed to be in the lead for prevention, consequence management may need the resources of many countries. NATO could plan and assemble such a capability. As we think of the possible use of chemical, biological or nuclear material in future terror attacks, the military expertise will become more necessary. The much publicised NATO Response Force, agreed at the Prague summit in 2002, might be better equipped with paramedics rather than precision weapons.</p>

			<h3>Great Change</h3>
			<p>NATO is currently in a period of great change. The 16 nations of the old alliance took on Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic as new members in 1999. Over the last five years they have become active and useful members, but this has required much work from them and from the Alliance. This May a further seven new members will join (Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia). The experiences of the first enlargement will certainly have paved the way for an easier integration of the new members, but there is bound to be difficulties during the process. One area of continuing concern is how decision making will be affected by the larger membership. The 1999 Kosovo campaign showed that it was possible, although occasionally difficult, to work with 19 members. Each NATO member has, in theory, equal voting rights; and consensus is always needed.&nbsp; It is perhaps easier to achieve this level of agreement over the management of peacekeeping and nation building tasks, but as post-conflict Iraq has shown, there may be difficulties even then.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>At the same time as the enlargement to 26 full members presents challenges, NATO has also a vast partnership scheme to supervise. Including full members, soon to be members and those nations in the Partnership for Peace, there are a total of 42 states. Beyond that the Mediterranean Dialogue promotes relationships with&nbsp; a further 7 countries. The special status of Russia, which on certain matters has virtual membership status, is also a full time activity for staffs. The success of the Partnership process has been significant. For many nations it has been a training ground for eventual membership, first of NATO and subsequently of the EU. It has been a help in moving towards fully democratic governments; and it has made it easier for nations to work together around the world on peacekeeping tasks. Itis also a valuable forum for discussion on approaches to reduce the threat of terrorism.</p>
			<h3>Mutual Security&nbsp;</h3>
			<p>The primary purpose of NATO remains as a collective security arrangement. It is there for each of the members to contribute to the defence of each other. In the Cold War, this was not only the sole activity, but it was also clearly defined by the obvious threat posed by the Soviet Union. In the decade of the 1990s, there was no clear territorial threat in Europe, and NATO expanded into its other useful, but secondary, military activities. It found itself operating in the Balkans stabilising the region. The terror attacks on the United States of 2001 changed the perspective again. NATO, for the first time in its 52 years, invoked the treaty clause, Article 5, which brought all members together in response to attack on one. It had little in a military sense that the USA wanted, but the gesture was important.</p>
			<h3>At Risk&nbsp;</h3>
			<p>We have therefore the strange situation that the Alliance once again faces a threat to its members&rsquo; territories, but that it has only a limited role to play. In Afghanistan, the United States took the major share of the action, and came to bilateral arrangements where it needed help. Only later, when the post conflict stabilisation force needed help, did NATO get the invitation to play a part. Again in Iraq, there was little prospect that NATO members would agree on the military intervention. Now, a year after the fighting, NATO is in line again to take a bigger role in the peacekeeping. Yet terror attacks are happening to its members on their soil. After the devastation in New York and Washington, there have been international terrorist attacks in Turkey and Spain. All NATO members feel themselves to be at risk from such attacks.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>If these attacks came from another state, NATO members would have no difficulty in implementing their treaty obligations. It is the challenge of countering a non-state actor enemy, which has yet to be resolved. NATO is structured around a military need, dating from the stand off between the West and the Soviet Union. Counter-terrorism has many more strands than the purely military. It requires police work, intelligence across many countries, and the involvement of trade, finance and development agencies. </p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The military may have a role to play, but more often in assistance to civil powers than in the lead. This makes NATO less likely to be the most suitable institution for countering terrorist threats to its members. Of course, the stabilising actions which it now carries out may well have longer term benefits in reducing support for terrorists.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>NATO&rsquo;s role as a counter-terrorism force is as yet limited, and is likely to remain so. While the US may wish to see NATO as an arm of its pre-emptive national strategy, European members are unlikely to allow this to happen. The Olympic Games will provide a focus for counter-terrorist thinking around the world. It may be that NATO can develop an important role in defending in the air and at sea, while providing the emergency response if the worst happens. Given the many factors beyond the military in defeating terrorism, Greece should also look to the European Union for help.</p>
