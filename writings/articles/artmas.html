<P>AIR POWER: A CENTENNIAL APPRAISAL</P>

<P>By Air Vice-Marshal Tony Mason</P>

<P>(Brasseys(UK) 1994) &#163;30, 320 pages</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Like the first cuckoo of Spring, this must be the earliest
sighting of a centennial review of the military use of air power.
Tony Mason takes his somewhat quirky starting date as the
presentation of a paper by Major Fullerton in 1893. Fullerton's paper
concluded that "command of the air would be an essential prerequisite
for all land and air warfare" The age of air power had dawned.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>While the book starts with a brief review of key milestones in the
development of air power theory and practice, this is not as one
might have anticipated merely a chronological review of the history
of military air developments. We are taken very rapidly into the
recent past and the post-Cold War world. It is a pleasant surprise to
find a chapter devoted to arms control and air forces. This is an
area not widely understood and with little literature for reference.
The author has done a great service in bringing together the events
of the hectic period when aircraft were brought into the CFE process.

<P>To examine the breadth of requirements for air power, he marks the
Gulf War and Bosnia as either end of a spectrum, and examines the
lessons of each in some detail. From the difficulties of Bosnia, the
reader is directed on to the current and possible future developments
in Russia. Here the analysis becomes more speculative, but is always
compelling given the author's depth of knowledge of the Russian air
forces. Finally, he turns to what he calls the era of differential
air power. He explains why the United States will remain a nation
with a quite different air power quality from all other states.
Future air operations will therefore be characterised by whether the
United States is involved or not.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The book is a fascinating read, but the reader will need to be
reasonably conversant with the main threads of the history of air
power beforehand. The ideas of Douhet and Mitchell are assumed to be
familiar territory. Two themes run through this appraisal. First,
there is a recurrent tendency for air power doctrine to run ahead of
technical capability: this is trap which can still affect the
enthusiast. Second, the terrible waste in resources which have
stemmed from inter-Service rivalries in many countries is well
documented. Looking to the future, Tony Mason reminds us that "among
the many resources which contribute to effective air power, only one
- people - actually appreciates, rather than depreciates with time."
All in all, this is an excellent, thought-provoking book with new
insights and research. My only slight criticism would be that the
examples may be rather too often from the UK, but I doubt that his
home audience will mind.</P>
