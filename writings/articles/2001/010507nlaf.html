		<h4>The Challenge</h4>
		<p>We Europeans are living at an exciting and critical time for the future of our security arrangements. We have the opportunity to move forward to a defence posture that will make the world safer, NATO stronger and Europe more secure. It will be a tragedy if we fail to seize the moment. We have grown used to the security blanket that NATO gave us throughout the Cold War, but the world has changed, and we must respond to that change. In this presentation, I would like to give a personal view on the nature of the challenge; why the future shape our air power is so important; the difficulties we face; the limitations of the current approach; and finally my thoughts on an approach which would bring us new real affordable capabilities in relatively short timescales.<br>
			<br>
			The end of the Cold War left NATO with a vast and expensive set of military forces, which had been training to fight a single campaign for over 40 years. Yet through the 1990's, the Western nations have had to undertake more diverse military action, under various banners, than at any time previously. Kuwait, Iraq, Somalia, Rwanda, Bosnia, Haiti, Albania, Kosovo, East Timor and Sierra Leone have seen western military force deployed to less than benign environments.. This series of military experiences is sufficient now to have established a strong consensus on the new rationale for NATO, which was articulated in the Strategic Concept launched at the NATO summit in Washington in April 1999. The accumulation of data from real operations, rather than deterrence postures, has highlighted major shortcomings in the security capabilities available to the Alliance for these new tasks.<br>
			 <br>
			In the chronology of the NATO Summit, the EU security developments, which culminated in Helsinki, and the Kosovo war, it is often now forgotten that the worries about European military weaknesses pre-dated the test of the Kosovo campaign. The Gulf War had shown that the US was both quantitatively and qualitatively in a different capability league from all the other nations involved. In the air, it was a war primarily of offensive air operations, and these had to be conducted from medium to high altitudes, where advanced defence suppression methods were more effective. The European military equipment was not well structured to the new doctrine. The gap in capability across the Atlantic widened through the 1990's, particularly in air power systems.</p>
		<h4>The current approach to European Defence</h4>
		<p>To develop European capabilities, Member States have set themselves the Helsinki headline goal. We have now, in theory, an outline plan for progress in improving European defence capabilities in a way which works with the grain of NATO. That is a remarkable step forward given the reluctance of the US and the UK in past years to address these issues. But there are many difficulties ahead. NATO would claim to have a planning process, and to have expended much effort over the years on coercing nations into setting more challenging force goals for themselves. In practice, the achievement of the process has been limited, particularly in the past decade. The institutional arrangements will almost certainly delay the development of the agreed capability. The omens are not good given the lack of progress on the DCI that has preceded this very limited aim for meeting the Helsinki Goals.<br>
			<br>
			But this is not the only problem. Defence capability in Europe is set to decline to near extinction because of the remorseless pressure of defence inflation. Time will not allow me to go into the detailed analysis here, but I have a joint article with a former NATO Ambassador, Sir Michael Alexander, coming out in the next edition of International Affairs which looks at the reasons and implications of defence inflation in a time of peace. In short, governments are reluctant to do more than keep defence spending level in real terms while there is no threat to their national territory. Personnel and equipment costs rise at a faster rate than domestic retail prices. Militaries are rationalised to bridge the gap in resources. Perversely those nations who have been most radical in their rationalisations (such as the UK and the Netherlands) have least room for manoeuvre now. Capability cuts are inevitable and will become progressively more serious, particularly at the expensive end of military force. Europe has pretty well opted out of military use of space, will air power be next?</p>
		<h4>Importance of Air Power</h4>
		<p>To this audience, I need hardly preach the importance of air power. Yet the key change that has happened through the series of post Cold War crises is a wider political understanding of the importance of air power capabilities. After the Gulf War, the UN operation in Somalia reinforced the perception, both in America and internationally, that the US was only prepared to remain engaged if their troops were kept safe. The predominance of air power solutions to international crises was underlined by the continuing air operations over both Northern and Southern Iraq. <br>
			<br>
			The sequence of events in Bosnia reinforced the US view that offensive air power could provide the necessary coercion to bring recalcitrant leaders to the negotiating table. The 1999 Kosovo air campaign brought together all the political and military lessons that had been learned in the post Cold War operations. I will not t rehearse the statistics about relative US and European capabilities and contributions. Suffice it to say that European airpower was of political rather military utility.</p>
		<h4>Current European Air Power Capability</h4>
		<p>Using the Kosovo campaign as a benchmark for a modern military operation which should be within the capability of European nations, we can break out the scale of effort that might be needed in future. The campaign needed to be able to call upon the traditional mix of air defence fighters, bombers, close air support, reconnaissance, airborne early warning, air-to-air refuelling, strategic airlift, tactical fixed wing and rotary transport capabilities. Although the maritime aspects of the operation were limited, it must be assumed that some future campaigns might need the appropriate mix of maritime reconnaissance, air defence, attack and anti-submarine warfare air assets. Discussion of Helsinki has focused on the troop requirements, but it is these air power needs which will pose the greatest challenges.<br>
			<br>
			The EU nations together have elements of all of these air power capabilities. They field some 3235 combat aircraft with a total air force manpower of 380,000. If the NATO non-EU members are added (Czech Republic, Hungary, Iceland, Norway, Poland and Turkey) the numbers rise to 4281 combat aircraft and 530,000 men. These large air power assets are however balanced to provide the defensive posture that was appropriate to the static defence requirements of the Cold War. They are also, in many cases, managed in such small packets as to be inefficient. All forces have a strong air defence element reflecting the requirement to defend their own territory. While many of the fighters can be used in a bombing role, they are not all weather capable and aircrew will not have undertaken primary training in this role. For offensive air operations, the only EU nations with a significant primary capability are France, Germany, Italy and the UK, who can field around 500 aircraft in an all weather bombing mode. Looking at the scale of offensive air capability needed for the Gulf and Kosovo, Europe needs to work at providing perhaps 50% more all weather bombers than it can at present. <br>
			<br>
			However, the platform is only part of the question in modern air campaigns. It has become very clear that in future operations, precision weapons will be the norm. Figures for weapons stocks are not readily available, but inferences can be drawn from the data of weapon usage in the Kosovo air campaign. Only 250 of the 1011 UK aircraft weapons used were precision , and for France the total was 582 laser guided bombs. The French Defence Ministry is quoted as saying that they had an inadequate stockpile of such weapons.</p>
		<h4>Approaches to Improving European Defence Capabilities</h4>
		<p>In any discussion about improving European defence capabilities, the argument usually begins with a plea for more spending on defence. It is also argued that greater integration of defence industries would be beneficial. Neither approach has much prospect of early success, and there can be no confidence that either would generate real enhancements in capability without a radical restructuring. Putting aside the political difficulties, Europe could undoubtedly organise its defence spending more efficiently if it were done on an integrated basis in the same way that the United States organises its armed forces at the Federal level. Such an approach for Europe will not be possible for many years (if ever), as it will necessary for EU member nations to give up national sovereignty to what is currently an unacceptable extent. <br>
			<br>
			In the near term (the next 5 years), it would be much more productive to look for opportunities to rationalise forces in being which can be operated more efficiently on a multilateral or EU-wide basis. The model for such a supranational activity is the NATO AWACs force, which has successfully provided an airborne early warning capability to NATO members at much lower day-to-day operating cost than would have been the case if operated on an individual national basis.<br>
			<br>
			For a number of reasons aircraft capabilities offer the possibility of much more quickly achieved improvements. Air procedures are already well harmonised between nations. English has become the universal language of the air, and this considerably eases the problem of mounting international combined air operations. Most importantly, given the high unit cost of air force platforms, it is not surprising that many nations operate common equipment. This also eases the problems of rationalisation. Finally, the high costs of infrastructure to support air operations mean that modest rationalisation can pay high dividends in achieving greater military capability at lower cost.<br>
			<br>
			Airlift is an obvious example of a capability that Europe needs and that could operate on a similar basis to NATO AWACS. If forces are to be deployed rapidly, they need to be able to call on a significant airlift capability. In looking for an opportunity for early rationalisation, we need to identify an aircraft type that is common to many EU members. The air tactical transport role is a capability that most nations require. Some ten EU nations operate some 137 C130 Hercules tactical transport aircraft. Pooling of some of these widely used C130 could provide an immediate European tactical fixed wing transport capability. Provided that nations structured their contributions sensibly, they could make operating cost savings at the national level through closure of bases, training units, and headquarters. Indeed this must be the criteria for such moves: bases closed, manpower reduced and cost savings. The level of saving would depend on the degree to which each nation felt able to rely on the supporting infrastructure being provided by a European facility.<br>
			<br>
				 For those nations that were prepared to put all of their C130 fleets into a common pool, there would be significant savings in operating costs. They would also have a much better assurance of availability on a day to day basis, given the ability to plan routine servicing across a larger fleet. For Europe there would be a usable airlift capability for humanitarian operations as well as for use within NATO. <br>
			<br>
			Over time, the management and operation of this common fleet would lead to a common perception among participating nations of the characteristics of the next generation transport aircraft. This would have great benefits in terms of reducing duplication of defence research and procurement costs in this particular area. The extra costs of operating on a national basis rather than a pooled basis would also become clear, and it is likely that nations would begin to see the advantages of contributing to such a force element.  This would also increase the pressure for common equipment procurement programmes for successor aircraft.<br>
			<br>
			In a slightly longer timescale, the requirement for a large strategic airlift capability could be tackled. The operation of such a fleet could easily be managed by the same organisation that would look after the tactical C130 pooled capability. It would be possible to procure a new capability whether it is in the end A400M, C17s or Antonov strategic transport aircraft that could either be operated by the military or on a leased basis from a commercial company. In either case the costs would be much lower than each nation trying to operate a very small fleet of large and expensive aircraft. <br>
			<br>
				Air to air refuelling capability is also needed by all European air forces, and would be a natural candidate for a European fleet operation. Consideration is being given to procuring the UK air to air refuelling capability through a public private partnership arrangement. This would be particularly easy to enlarge to encompass those nations in Europe that sought such a facility. The economics of the operation would improve for the larger fleet and there would be no sovereignty issues to worry about given the service was being provided by the private sector. For the UK, this could be a particularly attractive option, given that a large amount of money in the defence programme is currently posited against a national capability. A better capability could be achieved at a lower cost.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Reconnaissance and Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) are two roles, which are expensive in equipment and training, but which could offer opportunities for building up EU capabilities to operate with the US forces available to NATO. There will be considerable development in the use of UAVs for the tactical reconnaissance role, and there is a desire for a European satellite-based strategic reconnaissance capability. Both of these capabilities will be expensive, but are essential in the long term if Europe is serious in its intention to provide autonomous military capability. The information exploitation organisation will again be much more cost-effective if operated at the supranational level. <br>
			<br>
			None of the air transport, air tanker, reconnaissance or CSAR pooling proposals would undermine national capability. Indeed for the contributing nations it would both increase available capability and reduce costs. It is thus possible to see opportunities for enhancing the support element of air power in Europe in a relatively short timescale through aggressive rationalisation of forces in being, and exploiting the moves towards public-private partnerships. Significant defence funds would be released provided that nations took the consequent manpower and infrastructure savings which would flow. </p>
		<h4>Medium Term European Air Power Integration</h4>
		<p>While the support area offers opportunities for pooling and rationalisation of forces without too many issues of national sovereignty, real increases in capability will need a similar approach to the elements of combat power. Major EU defence players will not consider giving up their combat capabilities to a supranational authority unless and until some confidence has been gained through the less contentious pooling of support functions suggested above. <br>
			<br>
				Offensive and defensive air power capability is politically difficult to pool and operate at the European level, but is relatively easy to integrate at the operational level. Nations are prepared to make arrangements for multinational forces, but insist on retaining the ability to operate their forces nationally. The effect of this approach was seen in the divergence of the national Tornado enhancements over the past 20 years. The tri-national training unit was closed down in 1999 because the aircraft it operated were no longer representative of each nation's own Tornados. <br>
			<br>
				 As soon as it became politically acceptable, some of the existing common combat air equipment capabilities could be pooled in a similar manner to that described for the C130 force. An obvious example would be an EU F16 force. Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Netherlands and Portugal operate 424 F16s between them. Despite the divergence in Tornado IDS updates, Germany, Italy and the UK could look at how pooled arrangements might allow them to make a relatively early contribution of some of their 570 aircraft to a joint offensive capability.  <br>
			<br>
				The introduction into service of Eurofighter from 2002 to five European nations (UK, Germany, Italy, Spain and perhaps Greece) offers a good opportunity to enhance capabilities and reduce costs through pooling of assets. Sharing training, engineering, logistic, and operational planning facilities would throw up significant operating cost savings. These would be greatly increased if the number of bases required could be reduced as a result. Most importantly common fleet management would play a vital role in retaining system configuration control so that all Eurofighters remain fully interoperable. If Europe moved towards the American large airbase concept, we might perhaps imagine an operationally ready force of some 400 Eurofighters made up of 20 multinational squadrons distributed over as few as five airbases (one for each operating country).  In addition, an operational training base on a sixth airfield would be required.  The training base could also provide a home for the European Union Eurofighter HQ. The operating costs would be much less than the planned national arrangements, even if the traditionally smaller European airbases were retained.   The key to success would be the application of common training, procedures and aircraft modification programmes.  By making each unit truly multinational and by developing the overall common operational policy through the EU HQ, the problems of national divergence could be eliminated. A pooled fleet would also ensure that a common approach to weapons procurement was adopted. Indeed, it would become an attractive club to join: other EU nations could calculate the additional cost savings to be achieved by procuring Eurofighter as their successor combat aircraft.<br>
			<br>
				The development of an EU precision attack capability would be a key part of this medium term plan. The provision of adequate stocks of appropriate munitions would allow nations to contribute in other ways than just aircraft and aircrew. Starting the process early would allow a common view to emerge about the platform/weapons combination that should be developed. Leaving France, Germany, Italy and the UK to develop their own future offensive capability will inevitably result in a sub-optimal solution, with some relying on US solutions and other on national upgrades. A united EU view on both the importance and the nature of the next generation offensive air power requirement would be a very powerful driver towards procuring an effective capability. There is time for this process to begin, provided that nations start to operate in this role together. Under the current arrangements, Europe is likely to perpetuate the mix of systems of limited effectiveness in the offensive role. <br>
			<br>
				One of the more expensive power projection capabilities is provided by the aircraft carrier. Few European nations can afford to field such a force; for those that stay in the role, the opportunity costs are very high. The UK currently plans to provide two carriers, in 2012 and 2015, but for the reasons argued earlier seems unlikely to be able to afford such a capability when the time comes. France, Spain and Italy will probably wish to retain elements of the carrier role as well. Operated on a national level, one or two aircraft carriers do not constitute a viable and reliable force, and the opportunity costs are severe for other defence capabilities. The timescale is sufficiently long for interested EU nations to look at how they might jointly contribute to a force of 4 or 5 aircraft carriers with their supporting ships and aircraft. <br>
			<br>
			Intelligence requirements permeate every aspect of military operations, and an independent Intelligence capability will be needed if EU forces are to be able to operate truly autonomously . Pooling of current intelligence related air power capabilities will be difficult for a number of reasons. The equipment used by nations is diverse, and much of it outdated; the national exploitation is jealously guarded; and there are bilateral difficulties with wider information sharing. For these reasons, it would probably be more effective to build up a new EU intelligence capability from scratch. This would be expensive, but would allow a fully integrated modern system to be established relatively quickly. If the EU wanted to focus on one area for priority action, then Intelligence would provide it. The platforms, communication, fusion, exploitation and dissemination systems could be built up to be fully interoperable with NATO, but also independently usable. Kosovo showed that the inability to share digital intelligence data was a problem throughout the operation. </p>
		<h4>The Need for European Defence Funding Arrangements</h4>
		<p>These examples suggest some practical areas where the development of European Force Elements and common support and logistic services could provide building blocks for the strengthening of European defence capabilities. They would make more effective use of European national defence budgets through the removal of the cost overhang of separate support systems. There would remain a problem of the &quot;free-rider&quot; nation, although the audit and capability criteria proposals of the Helsinki Summit may help to stimulate contributions from EU member nations. At an early stage, it will be necessary to establish a European Defence Funding arrangement to which members contribute either capability or money.<br>
			 <br>
				For this approach to become coherent, it would be necessary to develop a planning and budgetary system at the European level.  Eventually there would be a requirement for a European Defence Budget.</p>
		<h4>The Vision: The European Air Force</h4>
		<p>In the much longer term, it is possible to contemplate the gradual development of the European Air Force as experience of pooling forces is gained. Confidence would grow with experience of the greater availability of air power assets to individual nations, to the EU and to NATO. Such a force would be in the lead for a wider integration of European defence capabilities, which would require the development of a European defence budget. Nations would still be able to retain independent national air capabilities if they so wished, but such national air power would not count as a contribution in European defence budget terms. <br>
			<br>
			There is a close parallel in these proposals with the original evolution of independent national air forces. Armies and navies wanted to own their own air power, and were concerned about becoming too dependent on an independent air force, which would be centrally controlled at the higher level. The costs, confusion and inefficiencies of maintaining army and naval air forces eventually led nations to form a third service which could procure and use air power effectively. The next stage for such sensible rationalisation must be an integration of air power across national boundaries. Those national boundaries may have had physical meaning on the ground and at sea, but are irrelevant in the air of Europe today. If the political will were there, Europe could produce effective modern air power, and could even do it more cost effectively than does the United States.<br>
			<br>
			This is an exciting and challenging prospect, where air forces could once again show that they were at the leading edge of thinking. The prize is a real usable capability for Europe and for NATO. If we continue as we have for the past decade, air power will become another unaffordable specialist activity, which only the United States can provide.<br>
