			<h4>Iraq: Getting trapped in the mangle</h4>
		</div>
		<p>(edited version appeared as Commentary in the London Evening Standard 18 October 2004)</p>

			<p>The flurry of leaks and MOD spin on Friday uncovered an advanced state of planning for deployment of the Black Watch battalion into the US sector of Iraq. This would mark a significant change, and the implications may be much greater than at first sight. The questions that need to be answered are strategic as well as&nbsp; tactical. If it were simply that a redeployment of 650 troops could make the chances of peace in Iraq greater, then few would quibble with what appeared to be an operational decision. Yet this cannot be the full story. The US has more than 130,000 personnel in Iraq, and the proposed British contribution adds just one half of one percent to this force.</p>
			<p>It has been argued that the Black Watch are tasked as a reserve force, and are thus&nbsp; available to reinforce when trouble breaks out. Equipped with Warrior armoured personnel carriers, they can react quickly into hostile situations. If they move out of the UK sector in the South, that reserve capacity will not be available to UK forces. As recently as August, the British needed every soldier they had. 100,000 rounds of ammunition were fired, and it was described as the most intense period of fighting for the British Army since the Korean War. Relative peace was only achieved by the mediation efforts of Ayatollah Al-Sistani. It will not be surprising if a massive offensive in Fallujah generates outbreaks of violence throughout the country. British forces may find themselves at greater risk having lost their ready reserve force.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Even so, military planning must look to priorities. Doubtless, the Ministry of Defence will argue that the current situation in Fallujah is so urgent that releasing US forces to sort it out is the immediate need. The Black Watch have the hard fast capability needed in the more turbulent central region of Iraq. This raises two practical questions. First, such a small force, deployed well away from the UK sector logistic bases, is unlikely to be an efficient way to mount operations. Resupply will use up scarce vehicle and helicopter assets as they must deliver logistic support from Basrah to the Baghdad area. Second, there is the problem of integration into the US concept of operations for their sector. It is no secret that there is a deep unease in UK senior military circles about the American tactics. We now know that when Ambassador Bremer was in charge, it was policy to ignore British advice. It is not clear that anything has changed since the end of the Coalition Provisional Authority. For the ordinary soldier, this high level tension translates into mixed message about rules of engagement. It would be wrong to place our soldiers at risk under operational control of US officers working to a different military doctrine.</p>
			<p>There is also a human dimension to be considered. The first elements of the Black Watch were due to be returning home in the next fortnight. They are on their second Iraq tour, and their families are looking forward to seeing their loved ones. The anxiety of operational tours has been compounded by the continuing uncertainty over the future of the regiment under the new defence cuts. Late changes of plan always cause a morale problem. The troops will doubtless do their best to meet the challenges of their mission, but there is a body of evidence to show how prolonged operations lead to much reduced operational capacity. The delay to the return home, the lack of clear information, the repeated operational tours, and the uncertain future for the regiment will lead to a less effective force.</p>
			<p>There are many practical reasons to think twice before volunteering British forces to bolster American operations in Iraq. But back at the Ministry of Defence, the Commitments Staff must also look at what the longer term implications might be. There is general agreement that violence is likely to increase in the run up to the January elections. An assault on Fallujah, which caused excessive civilian casualties, would increase conflict across the country.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the other nations contributing to the multinational forces are looking for ways to reduce or remove their forces. Currently, the UK can take comfort from a good record of achievement in a well defined area of responsibility. It may have to deploy more troops to this area if the violence increases. If it has also deployed into other areas, then it will have to plan to reinforce these troops as well if they find the going difficult. Iraq is already potentially a very long term commitment for Britain, it seems unwise to scale up the commitment without an urgent reason. Putting troops in will be much easier than taking them out.</p>
			<p>The only hope for improving security in Iraq in the long term is the proper training of Iraqi security forces. If there is currently any spare capacity in the British sector, then our soldiers should concentrate on speeding up the training programmes. If we wish to leave Iraq, this is the most urgent and important priority.</p>
