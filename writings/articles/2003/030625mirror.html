			<p><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">US forces in Iraq have been killed at a rate of around one a day since President Bush declared major combat operations at an end on 1May. In contrast, until yesterday, the British had managed to avoid any deaths from enemy action.  There are many reasons for this difference. The British zone around Basra in the South is peopled by Iraqis who had suffered greatly from Saddam Hussein's repression. They were always expected to welcome liberation. The taking of Basra was also done without the shock and awe tactics used further north; and so fewer civilians were killed or injured. There is also little doubt that the experience of Northern Ireland and the Balkans was useful to the British troops in making the difficult transition from fighting to peacekeeping. <br>
					<br>
					Yet the deaths of 6 Paras, and a further 8 casualties taken during the incident has been a salutary reminder that Iraq is still a very dangerous place.  Liberating armies can all too quickly become targets unless the transition to peace is handled very carefully. Using hard military firepower to keep the peace, as the US seems to in its area, is likely to be counterproductive. Innocent civilians suffer, and the population comes to hate its protectors.<br>
					<br>
					The American leadership in Iraq has not been very clever. However well Rumsfeld's new way of fighting wars went, he had not thought through the peace stage. Light ground forces may now be adequate for high tech wars, but you still need a lot of troops to hold the ring until a satisfactory  government structure is in place. The US changed their key players when things started going wrong, and this caused more confusion. The new supremo, Paul Bremmer made things worse by sacking the whole of the Iraqi army. This left a large unemployed, unpaid, military force with lots of weapons to add to the problems. He has now reversed that decision and has started paying them not to cause trouble. The prospect of some sort of Iraqi administration is disappearing into the distance as the security situation remains volatile. On top of this, Iraqis still fear the return of Saddam Hussein, while he is still at large.<br>
					<br>
					The British are able to give advice, but in the end have to share the consequences of US decisions. Without more troops, security will remain a problem. The longer that it is left, the more soldiers will be needed. Yet there are no spare UK forces, and even the US is feeling the pinch. Poland is trying to raise some support for its contribution without great success. It looks as though getting your allies aboard before you go to war would have been a good idea. It's going to get worse before it gets better.<br>
