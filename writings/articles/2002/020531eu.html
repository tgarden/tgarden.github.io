			<p>EU Crisis Management - a British View</p>

		<p>The world has changed greatly since the start of the adventure of EU defence capability development. The first moves towards an EU force were made possible in 1998 when the UK moved from opposition to support. However, in thinking about provision for the Petersberg Tasks (which were themselves formulated in 1992), EU members did not know what new security challenges they would have to face in the coming four years.  <br>
			<br>
			They did not conceive that there would be a requirement in 2002 for 50,000 troops to rebuild the shattered country of Afghanistan, and to give it hope to make the transition to a democracy. Yet that force, which Hamad Karzai pleads for, and the international community fails to provide, is just about the size foreseen by the Helsinki Headline Goal (HHG). Nor did European leaders  foresee that we would today be facing the prospect of the world's first nuclear exchange: two nuclear powers on the brink of war in India and Pakistan. The United States is preparing for the evacuation of tens of thousands of US citizens in the region. Presumably they will have priority over EU citizens for US military airlift if the worst comes to the worst. Rescue of our citizens is a central Petersberg Task. Has the EU thought about how it might manage it either before or after a nuclear war in the Indian subcontinent? <br>
			<br>
			At the same time the forecast of widespread famine in Southern Africa is hitting the headlines. This could be another task for Europe. The Middle East has taken a turn for the worse since 1998. There is no certainty about what will happen in Israel-Palestine in the coming months. It is on Europe's doorstep, and we will need to be able to react whatever the outcome. Add to that the prospect of a military operation, led by the USA, designed to change the regime in Iraq, and you have a busy security agenda for the region. <br>
			<br>
			Changes in relationships with Russia, the enlargement of both NATO and the EU, and the growth of capability in the US were all more predictable in 1998, but they are now realities. Finally in these strategic changes, affecting every aspect of approaches to security policy, is the attack on America on 11 September 2001. This new form and scale of terrorism was not taken into account by the architects of the new European security arrangement.<br>
			<br>
			It is in the light of these changing circumstances that I give a view  of how the EU crisis management arrangements have developed. The UK played, and continues to play, a key role. Until 1998, successive British governments had blocked the development of coherent European defence arrangements. The WEU was used in order to prevent true European capabilities from emerging. The feeling among British political leaders was that a stronger, more independent, Europe was a threat to NATO. The UK wanted the USA locked in to European security through NATO, and feared anything which might undermine this. The UK policy change in the autumn of 1998 was a watershed leading to the Anglo-French accord at St Malo in December. This in turn allowed  a succession of summits and meetings  through 1999 to enable the formulation of real aspirations at Helsinki at the end of the year.<br>
			<br>
			 Europe had recognised how dependent it had become on US military power earlier that year in Kosovo. The European members of NATO had promised to rectify their military weakness through the Defence Capabilities Initiative (DCI) of the Washington summit in April 1999. Three years on those DCI promises seem very hollow. The original 58 weaknesses identified are to be reduced by NATO to perhaps as few as 6. This will not be done by procuring new much needed capabilities, but by writing out much of the original work. This is a warning for EU defence hopes in general and the HHG in particular.<br>
			<br>
			The following year, the development of the institutions and the commitments progressed well. Indeed, it would be right to say that progress was very good given the history of such previous defence initiatives in Europe. The real military activity continued to be done in the Balkans through NATO, and, for the UK,  bilaterally in Sierra Leone, or through the United Nations in East Timor, or bilaterally with the US over Iraq. This was not unreasonable given that the EU had not yet declared an operational capability and the organisation was yet to bed down. It looked at the time as though there was some reluctance for the EU to push ahead with liaison arrangements for NATO, which was curious given the acknowledged dependence on NATO for shared assets.<br>
			<br>
			Last year, 2001, was not a good year for the fragile emerging European arrangements. The second commitments conference at the end of the year was having to deal with the missing enabling capabilities and how they would be brought into being.  A new list of shortcomings was produced, and these missing items made up about 70% of the list that the DCI had produced two years earlier. But the real change of focus came with the attacks on Washington and New York on 11 September. NATO simultaneously showed both its cohesion and its impotence. The declaration of article V was a powerful political signal of support for the USA, but the reality was that the US would not use NATO to prosecute its war on terrorism. Such European contribution as there was for the regime change operation in Afghanistan, and the subsequent pursuit of Al-Qaeda, was done on an exclusively bilateral basis. <br>
			<br>
			The sidelining of NATO, the new threat, and the large rise in US defence spending might have been expected to put a new sense of urgency into developing usable European capabilities. In fact the reverse seems to have been the case. The Europeans have looked inward at their own national security, and may be transferring the meagre resources that they had for projecting power to shore up their home defences. They have been demoralised by the scale of the increase in US defence spending, which makes the prospect of matching American technology and being interoperable seem even more difficult. Nor are they happy at the prospect of a division of labour, which leaves Europe doing the nation building (in the Balkans, in Afghanistan and perhaps next in Iraq) while the USA does the quick in and out high intensity campaigns.<br>
			<br>
			Certainly in the UK, the focus on European defence has disappeared. Prime Minister Blair is concerned with standing &quot;shoulder to shoulder&quot; with President Bush. The UK provides a large force of fighting troops to join US forces in the mountain operations against al-Qaeda, and at the same time provided the first headquarters for the stabilising force in Kabul. Meanwhile, the strains in the British defence budget become ever more obvious. The latest decision to retire the Sea Harrier  air defence fighters for carrier operations some 6 years early shows how bad things are. Interestingly these aircraft were a part of the UK's offer at the first HHG commitments conference. British aircraft carriers from 2006 and 2012 will need to operate with the US carrier forces if they are to remain safe.  A new update of defence policy is due to be published within the next month. It aims to rebalance UK defence needs in the light of changes since 1998. It is not expected to offer any great assistance to the development of EU capabilities.<br>
			<br>
			The story is repeated throughout Europe. Today Portugal agonises about its order for just three A400M transport aircraft, and is reported as taking out a bank loan to pay her troops. Individual nations are barely managing to hold the line on their defence capabilities, let alone provide for key enabling requirements for EU forces. There is a need for a radical new approach through greater defence integration, pooling of capabilities and using the savings from EU wide rationalisation to fund new capabilities. There seems little political will to undertake this in any of the EU member states, but Britain is particularly against such moves. This partly explains the unwillingness in the UK to redefine the Petersberg tasks in the light of the changes to the strategic context over the last 4 years. There is a fear that such changes will either give an opportunity for some nations to delay on their commitments, or that the logic of deeper integration may become more accepted. All of this is bad news for progress on European defence.<br>
			<br>
			The importance of NATO is also declining. The increase in membership and the new arrangements with Russia will inevitably turn it even more into a political rather than military organisation. It is likely that Kosovo was NATO's first and last war. Even so, it could serve a purpose in allowing the US and European states to act together when needed. The doctrine harmonisation and equipment interoperability functions are key to this, However, as the US new technologies drive force doctrine, it will become harder for NATO to keep this role. The US will not be interested in being dragged down by the lowest common  denominator standards which NATO will have to formulate.<br>
			<br>
			In summary, the UK officially espouses continuing strong support for all aspects of European defence. In fact, expectations have been much lowered over the past few months. The House of Lords Select Committee reported in March 2002 on progress. Among the conclusions were:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Command and control mechanisms remain poorly thought through.
			<li>There remain significant gaps in military capabilities both quantitative and qualitative.
			<li>There is a need for greater clarity in establishing the military tasks.
			<li> Not enough attention has been paid to the need for training and exercises.
			<li>Parliamentary accountability is inadequate.
		</ul>
		<p>The committee does not speak for the British Government, but there is no doubt that the concerns are widely shared by those who support the project as well as those against it.<br>
			<br>
			In this brief look at how far we have come, it is important to remember that great steps have been taken. Unfortunately enthusiasm seems to be reducing as the states are required to deliver something. I would pose a series of questions:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Can we afford to ignore the changes to our security needs that have emerged over the recent past?
			<li> How can we improve EU capability and military effectiveness without greater rationalisation?
			<li>What should we do about the widening gap in doctrine, capability and technology with the US?
			<li>Can we use the EU Convention to improve the coherence of our approach to security?
			<li>How do we keep up the political impetus which is the key to success?
		</ol>
		<p>Finally, I have said little about concepts. We can make concepts work only if we have the capability tools for the job. We look as though we may be heading for a major disconnect between the concept and the capability. Once we are serious about providing real useable military capabilities, the way that we use them will be relatively easy. And in all of this, the HHG is only the first step on a  path to a serious and appropriate European military capability which can be used in the service of the UN, in cooperation with the US through NATO or in other ways, or for the promotion of EU interests </p>
