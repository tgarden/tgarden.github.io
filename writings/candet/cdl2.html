<H2><CENTER>UNITED STATES' NUCLEAR STRATEGY</CENTER></H2>

<P>It is often assumed that the nuclear strategy of the United States
is more easily codified than that of the USSR because of the much
freer dissemination of information. While much has been written by
analysts and advisers, and much has been said by both military men
and politicians, the true nuclear strategy, planned or unplanned, can
only be deduced by an examination of the overall targeting plan at
any given timee. It is tempting to suggest that a particular
strategic doctrine was being implemented during a given period, and
then to demonstrate how the military posture supported this doctrine;
but this approach is less than honest. The development of new weapons
may be in response to a change in strategy, but may also be the
result of the pressures of industrial or military lobby groups, the
momentum of research, or the inertia of the procurement organisation.
</P>

<P>To examine the development of nuclear strategy in the United
States, it is necessary to compare the capabilities with the declared
policies in the light of the perceived threat.</P>

<H3><CENTER>NUCLEAR PREEMINENCE 1945-1950</CENTER></H3>

<P>When World War II ended, the United States found it prudent to
build up a stockpile of atomic bombs. Any potential nuclear weapon
state is limited by the time that it takes to produce weapons' grade
fissile material. The American stockpile grew, even though there was
no strategy in the immediate post-war period for the specific use of
nuclear weapons. There was, however, sufficient concern about the
future implications of such weapons for the Administration to push
hard for the international control of all nuclear activities through
the Baruch Plan. By 1948, the arsenal contained 50 atomic bombs,
which could be delivered by a total of 32 suitably modified B-29s
(l). While the strategic thinkers, such as Bernard Brodie (2) were
announcing the advent of deterrence, the military were absorbing the
new weapons into their contingency planning. Atomic bombs were seen
as more effective aerial bombardment weapons, which could be employed
in future conflicts to reenact the strategic bombing of World War II
with greater success.</P>

<P>The American perception for the threat of Communist expansion grew
during the period. The Truman Doctrine, in 1947, formalised the
opposition to the spread of Communism and by mid-1948, when the
Soviets blockaded Berlin, war between the United States and the
Soviet Union was an imminent possibility. The study by George and
Smoke (3) concludes that the Blockade was an example of the failure
of the American nuclear supremacy to deter lower level
confrontations. It would seem as valid to suggest that it was the
nuclear element which deterred sufficiently to keep the conflict at a
low level.</P>

<H3><CENTER>NUCLEAR SUPERIORITY IN THE 1950s</CENTER></H3>

<P>The Soviet Union tested its first successful atomic device on 23
September 1949. This did not instantly make it capable of effective
nuclear retaliation to any attack by the United States. It did,
however, concentrate the minds of the planners to the prospect of a
future where a nuclear strike might be reciprocated. Michael
Mandelbaum describes the 'New Look' of the Eisenhower Administration
in 1953 as the first time that the American government had given a
formal answer to what political purposes atomic weapons would serve,
and how they should be deployed to serve these purposes.(4)</P>

<P>The Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, in a speech in 1954
stated that it was the aim of the United States to deter the Soviets,
by meeting a range of Communist acts of aggression with the full
might of 'massive retaliation'. However by April, he had tempered
this view slightly, and was saying:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><ADDRESS>In many cases any open assault by
Communist forces could only result in starting a general war. But the
Free World must have the means for responding effectively on a
selective basis when it chooses. (5)</ADDRESS></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The policy retained a degree of ambiguity: massive retaliation,
with a flavour of flexible response to make it more digestible.</P>

<P>Professor Rathjens, who was involved with target planning, recalls
that there were three types of strategic targets considered. These
were the 'Bravo' against military targets in the Soviet Union; the
'Delta' destruction mission aimed at the Soviet war-making potential;
and the 'Romeo' mission designed to retard the movement of Soviet
forces into Western Europe. Discussion over priorities reveals the
relative importance accorded to each:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><ADDRESS>As might have been expected, there
was conflict over allocation or effort to the three missions:
arguments about which allocation would have the most favourable
effect on war outcome - significantly, not about whether allocating
more resources to, say, the Delta' mission would enhance deterrence.
(6)</ADDRESS></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Aaron Friedberg confirms the wide range of targets during this
period.(7) Despite the political debate over whether the policy of
retaliation against the enemy's cities and industry was the right
one, an increasing target list of Soviet military installations was
being developed. However, while counter-force targeting might have
its military (and moral) attraction, it was technically impractical
because of the limited weapon accuracy.</P>

<H3><CENTER>MUTUAL ASSURED DESTRUCTION 1961-1974</CENTER></H3>

<P>Defence policy had played a significant part in the presidential
election campaign of John F. Kennedy. It was inevitable that his
coming into office, in January 1961, would be an occasion for a wide
scale review of American nuclear strategy. He had dwelt much on the
forecast 'missile gap', which echoed the country's new realisation
that it was from hence forwards directly vulnerable in war. He
quickly made it clear that the policy of deterrence through massive
retaliation was to be maintained. His Secretary of Defense, Robert S.
McNamara, saw the problem initially as ensuring that the deterrent
remained credible, even if the enemy could launch a preemptive
attack. The policy must be to provide a survivable retaliatory force:
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><ADDRESS>We can no longer hope to have such a
deterrent merely by maintaining a larger stockpile of nuclear
weapons. Our weapons must be hardened, dispersed, and mobile so that
they can survive an enemy attack ...(8)</ADDRESS></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In this speech in February 1962, McNamara elaborated how these
survivable forces could be used. The single massive attack was one
option. They could be used to 'limit damage to ourselves, and our
allies, by knocking out the enemy's bases before he has time to
launch his second salvos'. A third possible use was as a bargaining
weapon to terminate a war. The new policy offered the flexibility to
choose from several operational plans, without requiring any specific
advance commitment. He emphasised the need to balance nuclear
strength with adequate non-nuclear capability.</P>

<P>In June 1962, the strategy was considerably refined when McNamara
said that the 'principal military objectives, in the events of a
nuclear war stemming from a major attack on the Alliance, should be
the destruction of the enemy's military</P>

<P>forces, not of his civilian population'. He went on to indicate
that the ability to destroy an enemy society would still be
available, and that this would give 'the strongest imaginable
incentive to refrain from striking our cities'.(9)</P>

<P>The Cuban missile crisis of October 1962 made the practical
application of nuclear strategy an imminent possibility. Robert
Kennedy writes of the attention which the President gave to every
detail of both the diplomatic and the military aspects of the
crisis.l&#176; From this, it seems inconceivable that, if nuclear
weapons had been used, it would have been other than very
selectively: individually and expressly approved by the President.
</P>

<P>George and Smoke, in their analysis of the crisis, conclude that:
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><ADDRESS>Thereafter, both sides substantially
lowered their expectations regarding the extent to which deterrence
and counter deterrence strategies could be used on behalf of foreign
policy objectives. (11)</ADDRESS></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In any event, the economic implications of a counter-force
strategy, and the reluctance of the public to relish a war-fighting
scenario, led the Administration to concentrate on the question of
the size of nuclear forces, rather than on strategy. Thus in 1965,
McNamara talked of the forces being required for two purposes:
assured destruction and damage limitation. By quantifying the
necessary level of assured destruction as 'say, one quarter to one
third of its population and about two thirds of its industrial
capacity', the required force could be calculated and defence
expenditure restrained. He went on to explain the difficulty of the
damage limiting role:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><ADDRESS>If we were to try to assure survival
of a very high percentage of our population, and if the Soviets were
to decide to frustrate this attempt because they viewed it as a
threat to their assured destruction capability, the extra cost to
them would appear to be substantially less than the extra cost to
us.(12)</ADDRESS></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>McNamara's conversion from the invulnerable counter-force
capability, with the reserve retaliatory force, was complete by 1967,
when he stated that:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><ADDRESS>It is our ability to destroy an
attacker as a viable 20th Century nation that provides the deterrent,
not our ability to partially limit damage to ourselves.(13)
</ADDRESS></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>A politician can announce a change of strategy in an instant; it
takes rather longer for the military to turn new policy into
operational practice. How did the Pentagon keep pace with the changes
in priorities? The indications are that it continued unruffled by the
changing doctrine. The decade had begun with the first attempt at
overall coordination of nuclear targeting: the Single Integrated
Operational Plan (SIOP) for the conduct of nuclear war. The first
SIOP was an 'optimum mix' of military, industrial and government
control targets, for use in a single massive attack. The revision of
the SIOP in 1961, to meet the new counter-force requirement,
distinguished between the three tasks of attacking nuclear threat
targets, other military forces and urban/industrial targets. It also
provided options for withholding attack from individual countries or
from cities.(14) This was the strategic flexibility of which McNamara
had spoken in his speech at Ann Arbor. He had also called upon NATO
to 'strengthen further their non-nuclear forces'.(15) The strategy of
strong conventional forces coupled with a wide range of nuclear
options was to form the basis of the 'flexible response' concept.
</P>

<P>At the strategic level, the target list increased as weapons
became available, and no particular emphasis on city (massive
retaliation) targets was given, as the Administration view swung back
towards mutual assured destruction. The military targets were
considered to be the most urgent, should war start, and so received
the greater effort. While the cities were nominally the first
priority, all that was required was a high level of confidence in the
ability to destroy them. Theatre nuclear weapons were increasingly
deployed in Europe, although firm Presidential control was retained
through locking devices, known as Permissive Action Links (PALs).(16)
No significant improvements in conventional forces were made.</P>

<P>The 1960s and early 1970s were characterised by the political
realisation that a nuclear war could not be fought and won. The
deterrent effect of mutual assured destruction must prevent the war.
The credibility of massive retaliation was to be maintained by
flexible response. That the forces and planning were not tailored to
the concept was highlighted by President Nixon's dramatic question in
1970:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><ADDRESS>Should a President in the event of a
nuclear attack be left with the single option of ordering the mass
destruction of enemy civilians, in the face of the certainty that it
would be followed by the mass slaughter of Americans?(17)</ADDRESS>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Although he had rather more options than his rhetorical question
would suggest, the preplanned flexible response involved options each
of which used large numbers of weapons. In 1974, the Secretary of
Defense, James R. Schlesinger, admitted that this had been the case
since 1961.(18)</P>

<H3><CENTER>LIMITED NUCLEAR OPTIONS 1974 ONWARDS</CENTER></H3>

<P>The credibility of a deterrent posture, which could involve the
total devastation of the United States of America in the defence of
Western Europe, was as questionable in 1974 as it had been in 1961.
The solution was again to develop some practical options which would
save the President from the stark choices of surrender or suicide.
The doctrine of flexible response had not provided the practical
options at the operational level. It was accepted that deterrence
might fail, and that the planning must take that into account. In
1974, Secretary Schlesinger made this clear:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><ADDRESS>Deterrence can fail in many ways.
What we need is a series of measured responses to aggression which
bear some relation to the provocation, have prospects of terminating
hostilities before general nuclear war breaks out, and leave some
possibility for restoring deterrence.(19)</ADDRESS></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>At the same time, he emphasised the need to preserve the ultimate
sanction of massive retaliation, invulnerable at all times. However,
for lower levels of action, it was essential to have a wide range of
target options. These options must include a capability for accurate
attacks, with minimum collateral damage. He also stated that the US
would avoid any combination of forces which might appear to the USSR
to be providing a first strike disarming capability.</P>

<P>From the military planning aspect, the new policy gave authority
to continue targeting military installations, nuclear forces and
urban/industrial centres as before. Technology was providing greater
accuracy of weapons, more warheads per missile, less vulnerability,
shorter response time and greater quantities of battlefield
information available to the commander (in theory). The new weapons,
with their rapid retargeting facility, greater accuracy and range of
warhead sizes, are well suited o a plan which requires many options.
It is less certain whether the strategy generated the technology, or
vice versa. In a recent study, Donald Snow concluded:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><ADDRESS>The simple fact, as has been
suggested earlier, is that improved targeting accuracy has been an
incremental outcome of guidance technology and, akin to MIRV, is a
classic case of technology leading doctrine. Doctrinal
rationalisation and virtue have had to be developed after the fact,
and, in all likelihood, no conscious a priori decision was ever made
to try to attain a hard-target kill capability.(20)</ADDRESS>
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Certainly the balance of evidence seems to support this view of
the development of American nuclear strategy.</P>

<P>The gradual transition to a formulation of a posture suited to the
best outcome should deterrence fail was added to in 1977. Secretary
of Defense Rumsfeld changed the emphasis of the massive retaliation
mission to that of retarding the ability of the USSR to recover from
a nuclear exchange and regain the status of a 20th century power more
rapidly than the United States(21) His successor, Harold Brown,
voiced the concern that still existed over the range of crises which
could be deterred by nuclear forces:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><ADDRESS>We no longer seriously believe (if
we ever did) that we can credibly deter most hostile action by the
threat of nuclear retaliation. Nuclear forces are useful primarily as
a deterrent to nuclear actions and to overwhelming non-nuclear
attacks.(22)</ADDRESS></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The wide range of targets was confirmed by President Carter in his
Presidential Directive 59 in July 1980. He directed that war planning
should emphasise the effectiveness of attacks against military
targets, although retaining the destruction of the Soviet economic
and industrial base as a principal objective. The 'number and variety
of options available to the President in the event of Soviet attack,
at any level' were increased.(23)</P>

<P>Much of the same doctrinal ground had been covered in the 1960s as
was covered in the 1970s. The new doctrine of limited nuclear
options, was, in effect, flexible response with the appropriate
weapons and operational plans. Doubts remained at the political level
about the credibility of deterrence at lower levels. Doctrine in
military circles centred on what to do if deterrence failed.</P>

<H3><CENTER>FUTURE TRENDS</CENTER></H3>

<P>The examination of American nuclear strategy over the past 36
years suggests that the analysts and politicians have made little
headway out- of the paradoxes of credible extended deterrence. The
military capability has steadily increased, from the 50 atomic bombs
of 1948 to the 10,000 weapons available today for the 40,000 targets
of SIOP-5.(24) The consistent thread throughout the period has been
the securing of an invulnerable massive retaliation capability. The
submarine force is likely to provide this capability into the future,
barring an unexpected breakthrough in either anti-submarine warfare,
or anti-ballistic missile defence.</P>

<P>The Reagan Administration made the modernisation of nuclear forces
the major factor in its defence policy. Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger expressed the rationale as:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><ADDRESS>The specificc objectives of
President Reagan's program are to regain and to maintain the
strategic balance with the Soviet Union, where balance is the key to
deterring any attack by them against ourselves or our allies.(25)
</ADDRESS></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This doctrine of deterrence through balance, rather than through
specific capabilities, reflects a prevalent feeling that relative
numbers are psychologically important. Among the new developments
which Weinberger outlined, he made a particular point of the
requirement for an improvement in accuracy of the land-based
missiles. This is probably another instance of technology determining
policy, but it has generated considerable criticism. Greater accuracy
is of use for strategic missiles if they are to be aimed at the
enemy's hardened missile silos. As there is limited value in
destroying empty silos, and the land-based missiles are themselves
vulnerable to attack, the critics see the new proposals as being
directed at the development of a first strike force, which they
believe is destabilising.</P>

<P>In 1983, President Reagan announced a new direction in strategic
thinking:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><ADDRESS>Let me share with you a vision of
the future which offers hope. It is, that we embark on a program to
counter the awesome Soviet missile threat with measures that are
defensive ... What if free people could live secure in the knowledge
that their security did not rest upon the threat of instant US
retaliation to deter a Soviet attack; we could intercept and destroy
strategic ballistic missiles before they reached our own soil or that
of our allies?(26)</ADDRESS></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This desire for a policy based on strategic defence echoes back to
McNamara's search for a damage limitation strategy in the early
1960s. The technological, financial, tactical and strategic questions
which need to be answered make it still an uncertain venture. The
President's own Commission on Strategic Forces remains skeptical:
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><ADDRESS>At this time, however, the
Commission believes that no ABM technologies appear to combine
practicality, survivability, low-cost and technical effectiveness
suf- ficiently to justify proceeding beyond the stage of technology
development.(27)</ADDRESS></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In summary, the politicians have throughout the period tried to
find ways to make nuclear deterrence credible for all levels of
conflict by various declaratory postures. The military have evolved
their plans for action should deterrence fail. The scientists have
produced weapons with the traditional military improvements of
accuracy, range, reliability, effectiveness, flexibility and
invulnerability. The sum has been to produce a force, greatly in
excess of any massive retaliation requirement, but one of such power
that it is difficult to conceive of an enemy taking the risk of
unleashing it.</P>
