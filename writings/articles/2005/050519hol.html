			<p>My Lords, I&nbsp; start by congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Drayson on his appointment as the Minister in the hot seat at the MOD. We are all only too aware of the difficulty that successive governments have had in trying to improve defence procurement. I know that we all wish him well, and hope that his business expertise will be put to good use in improving the key area of defence procurement.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>This debate on the foreign affairs, defence and international development aspects of the gracious speech is&nbsp; particularly important as a number of different problems are coming together. Other speakers will I know deal with our role in Europe more widely, and I shall confine myself to security aspects. Again development assistance in Africa is an issue, but so is the security situation in places like Darfur. The wider Middle East has many foreign policy challenges, but we still have a&nbsp; deep practical military problem in Iraq.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>Manifesto and Queens Speech<b>&nbsp;</b></h3>
			<p>As usual, the Gracious Speech was a little short of detail on future defence policy, apart from the undertaking to establish a unified system of service law, the principle of which we&nbsp; support from these benches. I therefore read Chapter 7 of the Labour manifesto for greater guidance. However, apart from congratulations to the armed forces and justifications for cuts already announced, there was little in that document to indicate detail of future programmes. I suppose the most encouraging pledge in the Labour manifesto was: &quot;The best defence of our security at home is the spread of liberty and justice overseas. In a third term we will secure Britain's place in the EU and at the heart of international decision-making. We will always uphold the role of international law.&quot; Fine sentiments, and we shall hold the government to account against those standards.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The lack of public debate during the election over the place of defence in our national priorities was unsurprising. Yet there are major challenges which need to be addressed. In listing them, &nbsp;I am tempted to repeat the excellent piece of analysis produced by Michael Codner, the Director of Military Sciences at the RUSI,&nbsp; in the current edition of the RUSI journal, and reprinted in The House magazine just before the election. I declare an interest as a Council Member of the RUSI. He produces ten major issues&nbsp; (Defence Expenditure, Expeditionary Strategy, the Nuclear Deterrent, European Defence,&nbsp; US relations, War Powers, Aircraft Carriers, Missile Defence, Reserve Forces/Homeland Defence and the role of the Private Sector) as examples of where&nbsp; difficult choices have to be made, and articulates the arguments on each side of the case well. I commend the analysis to your Lordships. It reminds us that in defence we cannot have everything and do everything. Our responsibility as politicians is to make the best judgments about the balance of risks and costs.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>Alliances</h3>
			<p>We now have much less certainty about the framework within which we will need to use our military capability. The Gracious Speech said that the Government will work to strengthen commitment to the continued effectiveness of NATO. Yet we need perhaps to consider whether we are putting enough thought into where NATO is going. I understand that the Alliance is formulating a Comprehensive Political Guidance document, which eases the problem of having a full blown new Strategic Concept to replace the now outdated 1999 Concept. What are the key elements that the Government wishes to see included in this guidance? The post-Iraq strains have not totally disappeared between NATO members. There are particular problems in terms of NATO and EU relations since the accession of Malta and Cyprus to the EU. Will the Government be using its presidency of the EU to make some progress in getting these two important elements of our security talking to each other?&nbsp; There is one other issue which may be a challenge and that is future nuclear policy for NATO. The question of NATO-US nuclear weapons based in Europe is being raised in Germany. What view does the government take on the future requirement for these systems given the changing role of NATO?</p>
			<p>Our other major military co-operation project is within the EU. We welcome the emerging work of the European Defence Agency and from Mr de Vries, the EU counter-terrorism co-ordinator. Could the Minister indicate how intelligence sharing arrangements are progressing for both military and counter-terrorism aspects of EU security?</p>
			<p>&nbsp;The transfer of the Bosnia responsibility from NATO to the EU appears to have been made without major problems. What is the state of play on the new EU battlegroups? How many are now operational, what EU training have our forces been involved in, and is there now a proper evaluation and standardisation system in place to measure readiness, and operational effectiveness? If, as I suspect, there is still some way to go on the evaluation requirement, could the Government undertake to bring pressure to bear on other EU members? Without setting and measuring standards, we run the risk of political rather than operational capabilities.</p>
			<p>The Gracious Speech concluded with an undertaking to deepen and develop the strong partnership between Europe and the United States. I am sure other noble Lords will comment on the wider&nbsp; challenges implicit in this undertaking. In the defence area, we are ever more closely hitched to the accelerating American&nbsp; wagon. This gives added strains to the budget as we try to keep up with a nation spending such colossal sums on research. Nor is our close relationship providing the sharing of technology which we had expected. I trust that the noble Lord, Lord Triesman&nbsp; and his colleagues in the Foreign Office, will be working hard with the MOD to bring the necessary pressure to bear on the United States to enable adequate technology transfer. In this context, he might also like to reconsider our position on lifting the EU embargo on arms sales to China.&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>Operations</h3>
			<p>I will now turn to operations in which are forces are engaged. There are so many, that it is impossible to dwell on any in detail. Iraq hangs over all defence planning at present. I hope that the new Ministerial team will push for a clearer strategy for our military contribution in Iraq. It is not a sensible to policy to drift on day by day without some more detailed long term strategy, against which success or failure can be judged. Now that we have a transitional Iraqi government, a political timetable, and a UN resolution, it is time to have an agreed force plan between Iraqis and contributing nations. The current strategic drift &#150; we are there as long as the Iraqis want us &#150; puts our strategy in the hands of the insurgents.</p>
			<p>Things are bad at the moment, although less so in the UK sector. It is now widely admitted that serious mistakes were made during the period that the CPA was running the country, and that the chaotic situation stems in large part to lack of a coherent strategy then.. We covered those in our debate on Iraq. Let us not repeat the previous mistakes. An agreed timetable for overseas forces to reduce as Iraqi security capabilities increase, coupled to the political process over the coming year, would provide the necessary challenge to get resources where they are needed. Such a plan would need to be revisited regularly, and it would highlight where the strategy was succeeding and where it was failing. It would help keep wavering Allies aboard, and it would give hope to the Iraqis that the occupying forces will leave. I call, as I have on previous occasions, for the government to publish objective regular and comparable statistical data on the security and economic situation in Iraq, so that we can all see where we are succeeding and where more effort is needed.</p>
			<p>With so many of&nbsp; UK forces committed to the endless prospect of tours in Iraq, our thoughts are with those now preparing for our increased presence in Afghanistan. It would be helpful if the&nbsp; Minister could update us on the plans for using the Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps&nbsp; Headquarters, and what scale of British troop involvement is expected given that we are the framework nation for the HQ; and how it will relate to the continuing warfighting operations that the US is conducting in Afghanistan under the banner of Operation Enduring Freedom.</p>
			<p>The Balkans is by no means over as a military operation. What is our strategy for Kosovo on the political, military and economic fronts? Do the contingency plans for a worsening situation assume yet more British forces are available?</p>
			<p>When the Minister winds, I am sure that he will make reference to our plans for helping Africa. The Gracious Speech referred to the continuing conflict in Dharfur. Resolution will need some form of peacekeeping forces. Given our focus on the issue, will the Minister indicate whether he foresees a significant British contribution there as well. In any event does the British Government favour such an action under NATO or EU auspices? I trust that he will spell out the potential commitment for British forces.</p>
			<p>The last operational theatre that I call for greater clarity is that of Northern Ireland.&nbsp; The Labour manifesto highlights that the reduction in infantry battalions has been made possible because of the improved security situation there. Does the government accept that while the security situation can change in a matter of months, it takes years to replace forces that have been disbanded?</p>
			<p>Even this brief survey of some of the commitments that we expect our armed forces to cope with shows how the continuing operational tempo is remorseless, and our level of risk is increasing given the declining numbers.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>Equipment<b>&nbsp;</b></h3>
			<p>I turn next to the equipment of the armed forces. The noble Lord, the Minister has defence procurement as his prime new task. Neither the Gracious Speech nor the Manifesto had much to say on the subject, with one exception. The manifesto made the explicit statement: &quot;We are also committed to retaining the independent nuclear deterrent&quot;. In this the Government enjoys cross party support since the continuation of the Trident minimum deterrent&nbsp; is common ground.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>However, the government has also indicated that it will need to consider the replacement of Trident during this parliament. Such forward planning is always sensible, even for a system with a lifespan of 30 years, where the capability only came into service in the period from 1994 to 1999. It will be a discussion that we will welcome, and I am sure that the wider public will wish to debate. I urge the Government to make this an inclusive process.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Time will not allow me to go through a detailed list of the delays and difficulties with various equipment projects. I am sure that the new Minister will be probing his staff at Abbey Wood to find answers. There is however one more strategic aspect of defence equipment procurement which I wish to raise. Those of us who have been involved in fighting the recent general election are only too well aware of how the electorate expects their&nbsp; constituency MPs to secure and keep jobs in local industry. Yet, we know that subsidised and protected industries become uncompetitive. In nearly all other industries, government has turned to lighter regulation and the benefits of competition. Defence has been the exception. Partly because of a wish to keep a national defence manufacturing capability, partly because of exemption from EU competition policy, and partly because of&nbsp; the political imperative. Against this the MOD, under successive governments, has tried to keep competition alive, and to get best value for money, and I would argue has over the years made some slow progress. I trust that the noble Lord, the new Minister for Defence Procurement, will look carefully at the way things appear to be going. Lack of competition will lead to increased costs, delays in delivery and reduced military effectiveness. Perhaps most importantly, the short term apparent kindness of&nbsp; over-protection leads to the long term decrease in international competitiveness and decline in our industrial base.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>People</h3>
			<p>I turn finally to the question of the people; those in the armed forces, the civilians who support them and all their families who make so many sacrifices. I have said before that the dedication of the armed forces is in one sense makes them their own worst enemies. As they are expected to do more and more with less and less, they strain every sinew to do a good job. But it is at a price. I cannot remember a time of such cynicism. We may blame it on modern culture, the media or politicians &#150; but previously the Services have remained insulated from these trends.</p>
			<p>The remorseless grinding down of the defence inflation effect means that regardless of the recent welcome small real increases in defence budgets, the MOD has a big financial problem which reaches down through the budgetary process to the lowest level. The infinite irritations of penny pinching measures, coupled with the decade of downsizing, is sapping the life out of our armed forces. We express surprise when Deepcut happens, but do not ask what has happened to supervision levels. We regret the waste of money on the crass decision to ruin brand new helicopters by modifying their airworthiness away, but do not ask whether we can still attract the brightest and best to make these expensive decisions.</p>
			<p>I follow closely the detailed statistics provided by the Defence Analytics Services Agency. These show the rising exits under premature voluntary retirement from all three services. While recruiting may be adequate, the costs of loss of experience are both financial and in terms of capability.</p>
			<p>The armed forces are this country's last line of defence in so many areas. We need them to cope with emergencies both manmade and natural. We want them to be at the frontline of making the world a better and safer place. Yet it is difficult for them to voice their concerns, and they feel support&nbsp; ebbing away. It says it all that the Labour manifesto claimed credit for supporting veterans with &pound;27 million of lottery funding. We might in the past have thought that our armed forces deserved the direct support of the government. Nor do our armed forces feel connected to this place, to Parliament. They have always had a difficulty with representation given their itinerant lifestyle. The difficulties over service voting has I hope raised this as an issue. I have written to the Chairman of the Electoral Commission, and copied the Defence Secretary, with a series of issues which need to be taken forward to make our armed forces feel that they have proper representation of their interests. I trust the MOD will support this initiative.</p>
			<p>In every debate and every defence question, your Lordships rightly pay tribute to the dedication, loyalty, courage and competence of our men and women of the armed forces. They are the ultimate public servants giving up the easy life for the exhilaration , adventure&nbsp; and personal satisfaction of serving in the armed forces. The sacrifices that they make are real in terms of family stability, risk of injury, and lack of personal freedom. It is a volunteer professional force, and each individual member of the Army, Royal Navy and Royal Force will weigh the plusses and minuses of military life in deciding whether to stay or go. The Government has a responsibility to the country to make sure that the balance does not tilt so far into the negative that we lose our unique military capability.</p>
