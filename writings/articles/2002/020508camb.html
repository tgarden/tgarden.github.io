			<p>The months go by and the security situation in Israel and the Occupied Territories becomes worse by the day. There is no lack of peace plans. From Oslo to Abdullah, there have been rational schemes which could improve Israeli security, and give the Palestinians a viable state. The shape of the ultimate settlement, if it is ever achievable, is obvious to most outside observers. The Palestinians will have to accept compensation in exchange for the right of return of refugees to their old homes in Israel. There is no peaceful arrangement in view, which might allow Palestinians to flood back from around the world to outnumber the Israelis. They have a case for their claims, and they need to be properly compensated. This is a difficult issue, and Arafat or his successor will have to work hard to sell it. In a mirror image of this significant concession, the Israelis will have to remove all their settlements in the Occupied Territories, and the inhabitants will have to be compensated. There is no possibility of a viable Palestinian state if the settlements and their access roads remain. Most of them have been located with the intention of dividing the territory, and controlling the water resources. It will be hard for any Israeli leader to sell this idea. Indeed it is possible that Rabin was assassinated in 1995 because he was accepting the necessity for removing the settlements. But there is a symmetry in the concessions that both sides will have to make.<br>
				<br>
				As for Jerusalem, the simple solution would be to make it an international city, which neither side could claim as its own. Objecting to such a concept is likely to be the only area of agreement for both Israel and Palestine. Certainly, neither should be allowed to declare Jerusalem as their capital, and some system for running the city jointly must emerge. If  the design of the major points of an agreement are clear, and would include Abdullah&#146;s offer for pan-Arab recognition of the right of Israel to exist, there are other issues on the relationship between the two states that would be necessary. The land area is so small, and they are so closely entwined economically, that it would be essential that there was a co-operative security arrangement between the two states. This sounds very difficult in the current climate of mistrust. Yet Israel has managed to achieve just such a relationship with Jordan. That must be the model for any future Israel-Palestine agreement. <br>
				<br>
				The question now is how it is possible to get from the current situation to this rational arrangement for the two peoples. The military operations in the West Bank and Gaza by the Israeli Defence Forces have made the prospects of a long term settlement much lower. The added sense of humiliation and anger among Palestinians (and beyond to their Arab neighbours) is one factor. But perhaps even more important has been the destruction of the Palestinian Authority infrastructure. It seems clear that part of Israel&#146;s strategic plan has been to destroy the sinews of a functioning Palestinian state. Even if peace broke out tomorrow, and the Palestinian Authority were invited to take over control of government in its areas of interest, it could no longer carry out the task. It appears that this may be part of Sharon's strategy, and in his vist to the US this week he has been promoting the idea of  setting up a new PA. The successive years of investment in governance, largely funded by the EU, has been destroyed in a matter of weeks. This a real problem. But it is not one that is unfamiliar to the international community. In Mozambique, Kosovo, Sierra Leone, East Timor and now Afghanistan, the rebuilding of nations from chaos has been undertaken. Palestine will need a similar approach. <br>
				<br>
				How will such a peace arise? There is no possibility of Arafat and Sharon suddenly deciding that they have had enough and agreeing to change their current nihilistic approaches. This means that a settlement will have to be imposed from outside. Since neither Israel nor the Palestinians can do much without outside financial support, money must be the first area in which to exert pressure. Ideally the USA should use its large financial and military equipment clout to force Israel to the negotiating table. The EU is in a similar position with the Palestinians. If the US is unable or unwilling to undertake this, then the EU, with the help perhaps of the UN, will need to take on the whole problem. Israel needs its trade with the EU, and the special arrangements that it has for that trade. It is unlikely that the US would be prepared to bankroll any Israeli deficit stemming from an EU trade embargo. At the same time the UN needs to push aggressively to investigate every potential war crime caused by either side. The world must bring these two peoples to a stable arrangement, even if they appear to be set on self destruction. The alternative is a regional war which will affect the well being of all nations for a very long time. <br>
				<br>
				What happens in Israel-Palestine is also intimately bound up with what will happen either in or to Iraq. A war with Iraq appears to be drawing closer. There still remains no evidence of any link between the terror attacks on the US and the unpleasant regime in Baghdad. We can safely assume that if any evidence existed, then it would have been revealed by now. The rationale for putting Saddam Hussein high on the US military hit list is the increasing concerns about his development of weapons of mass destruction. This is not a new concern, Saddam used chemical weapons for internal repression as well as in his war with Iraq over a decade ago. After the Gulf War, large chemical weapon stocks were destroyed. He was also investing great efforts in both biological and nuclear weapon development. The scale of the nuclear research work was astonishing, but again that was dismantled by the UN inspection regime. Although the UN inspectors were hampered in their work, it is generally agreed that they were successful in preventing Iraq from gaining an operational nuclear weapon capability, and they much reduced their other weapon development. <br>
				<br>
				Since the inspectors left four years ago, information has mainly come from defectors and overhead surveillance. The patrolling of the No Fly Zones by US and UK air forces has undoubtedly also kept the Iraqi military focused on their own survival. Sanctions will have hampered technical imports. Nevertheless, these loose constraints will have left some leeway for work to continue on all aspects of the Iraqi weapons' programme. It may be that intelligence assessments are now driving the sense of urgency for doing something about Iraq.<br>
				<br>
				What are the options? We could continue as before. Sometimes the current strategy is to be preferred, if all alternatives are worse. The UN could act to bring pressure to bear through more directed (&quot;smart&quot;) sanctions. It would seek to get the inspectors back in. Thirdly, a wider air campaign could be used to increase the pressure for getting the inspectors back in. This would be comparable to the Kosovo strategy, where the air campaign was designed to bring Milosevic back to the negotiating table. The fourth option could be an Afghanistan style campaign which sought to use proxy forces on the ground with massive air support to change the regime. Finally, a full scale ground and air war might be undertaken to replace the Iraqi power structure.<br>
				<br>
				All these strategies carry risks, particularly in light of the current highly volatile situation in the region. The UK government does not yet have a clearly articulated policy view. Tony Blair appears to support a US led major military operation. Some in the cabinet would be happier with a war aim that specified the return of the UN inspectors. In the US, there seems little interest in options short of a regime change. Much of the hard talk may be designed to add to the pressure on Saddam, but there is little point in making threats if there is no willingness to carry them out.<br>
				<br>
				How practical are the military options? We have a measure of the scale of military force needed for a campaign against Iraq. In the 1991 Gulf War, a ground force of around 250,000 was assembled to expel the Iraqi invaders from Kuwait. In the event, the prolonged air campaign meant that the ground forces had a relatively easy time, and were able to retake Kuwait in under a week. An attack on Iraq would be a much large war aim with the need to secure a much greater area. The time taken by the pre-cursor air campaign would give Iraq plenty of opportunity to cause trouble in the region. A ground force at least as large as for the Gulf War would be a wise precaution. However basing for such forces might be more difficult than ten years ago. Saudi Arabia is unlikely to welcome yet more foreign troops.<br>
				<br>
				It has been suggested that the UK might be asked to provide 10% of the ground troops. That would amount to a quarter of the British Army. Already pulled in so many directions, it seems difficult to see how this could be managed without considerable damage to operations in Afghanistan, the Balkans and in Northern Ireland. More reservists are already being called up to fill in the gaps of present commitments. This could be the final breaking point for British forces, which seem to be needed to be in the lead everywhere.<br>
				<br>
				The military commanders will want to know what the desired end state is to be. How will the Kurds in the north be handled? The Kurds may alarm Turkey with demands for self governance. Or are we now to have a new form of imperial rule, which will require a continued Allied military presence for years? That will not be an option if we also want to rebuild Afghanistan. NATO, somewhat bruised from its lack of a role in Afghanistan, will find it difficult to achieve consensus for action among its members. Nor will Israel sit on the sidelines as it did in the Gulf War. Sharon might be very pleased to have an external enemy in Iraq to deflect criticism of his internal difficulties.<br>
				<br>
				Maybe the current approach, with increased pressure through the UN sanctions regime will look more attractive as the detailed planning starts. Whatever the approach, it probably means yet more strains on the transatlantic relationship. It will certainly leave Tony Blair in a very politically exposed position both at home and in the EU.<br>
