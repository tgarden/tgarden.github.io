			<p><font size="-1">As the expected start time for military operations in Iraq shrinks to a matter of weeks, there will be a new pressure on Tony Blair. The Chief of Defence Staff  must soon press him for a clear list of military aims. War planners need to turn the grand strategic will of  elected politicians into a series of  very specific tasks for the armed forces. This is always a difficult process even when the political aim is as clear as it was for the last Gulf War. When operations are conducted with allies, these military aims need to be agreed with all the coalition forces. <br>
					<br>
					How difficult will it be to construct the directive for the coming Iraq campaign?  The political direction is currently less than precise. For the UN, the primary task is the disarmament of Iraq&#146;s weapons of mass destruction. Enforced disarmament is not an operational activity of which anyone has much experience. If you know where the illegal weapons are stored, then the priority might be to capture those facilities. If the intelligence picture is less certain, then the command centres for these weapons become the target. <br>
					<br>
					If America and the Britain go without explicit UN backing, they may prefer to translate the political imperative for regime change into the focus of the military tasking. It will be argued that disarmament can be more easily achieved once the country is under the control of friendly powers.  Regime change needs some thinking through before it can be translated into a set of military objectives. <br>
					<br>
					The desired end state is key to determining the way the military phase is tackled. There appears to be a political consensus to preserve Iraq as a single entity; US or international leadership will be needed for some time; and that it should move to some form of democratic government in the longer term. Preserving the territorial integrity of Iraq will be tricky, and must affect the military strategy. The difficulties in the north are well known. The Kurds have developed a reasonably satisfactory degree of autonomy. Turkey is concerned for its ethnic minority in the region, worried about Kurdish aspirations for independence, and has one eye on the northern Iraqi oilfields. The much abused people of Southern Iraq have little love for Saddam Hussein&#146;s repressive regime, but have not forgotten that they were left high and dry by the West after being encouraged to rise up after the last Gulf War. They may look to Iran for help this time. <br>
					<br>
					To US planners the simplest way to keep Iraq together after a war may be to use the current Iraqi security forces, but under new management. This would need a very specific direction that the security apparatus should only be disabled, but not destroyed during conflict. This is not an easy military option. There will be many other political desires which will need some hard thinking to turn into crisp military orders. How important is saving the oilfields from destruction? What priority for refugee handling? Which cities can be bypassed? How do we deal with Iraqi civilian mass casualties? What plans for dealing with prisoners of war? <br>
					<br>
					Time is short and great uncertainties remain about both operating bases and strategy. The drawing up of clear military directives is a useful check for any political leadership that they have thought through what they want their armed forces to achieve. It also ensures that all participants are working to the same end. Armed forces in democracies expect and must be given clear direction by their elected government before the start line is crossed.</font></p>
