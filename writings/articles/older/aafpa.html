<ADDRESS><CENTER>February 1997</CENTER></ADDRESS>

<P>We are now only a matter of weeks away from a general election in
the UK. It is unusual to be able to say that with a degree of
certainty given that, as I am sure you know, unlike the US the UK
government chooses when it wishes to hold the election. However there
is a maximum of 5 years and we are coming up against that stop. I
come with no inside knowledge of what the date will be, but it must
be by May, and given the government's minority position now, it could
be brought about even earlier either through a vote of no confidence
by the combined opposition parties, or by the government choosing to
call the election in anticipation of such a vote. So we will have a
new government soon, even if we are not exactly sure when. Nor can I
tell you what the composition of that government will be. The current
opinion polls suggest a fairly hefty majority for a Labour Government
under the leadership of Tony Blair. They also predicted (wrongly)
last time a Labour Party victory, but claim that they have now
corrected that polling error. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In looking at what the potential effects of a change of government
are on Britain's attitude to its international security obligations,
I am helped by a reasonable consensus between the three parties. We
can therefore construct the likely policy drivers against a range of
possible election outcomes and see what the possibilities are. Let me
start by reminding you where British Defence Policy is today and what
the capability is in general terms. As with most other countries we
have seen a fairly radical reappraisal since the end of the Cold War.
The key elements of policy have however remained. We continue to
operate a strategic nuclear deterrent force, but are phasing out all
other nuclear capability. We continue to accord our contribution to
NATO as the main focus for our military forces, and we recognise
wider security obligations in the world which include UN operations.
There are also a number of national security tasks - some the
remnants of empire, but those declining, and of course the major
internal security task in Northern Ireland.  </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The end of the Cold War review in round terms lopped about a third
of the British forces, but kept the broad range of capabilities as
before. Since then we have continued to trim the resources allocated
to defence and reduced those aspects of military capability which
were more relevant to large scale high intensity short notice war.
This has been not without its difficulties, but as the Gulf War
showed we still have a need for such capabilities.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>While the UK was among the first nations to carry out a major
reduction in defence capability at the end of the Cold War, it has
been argued by some that it was planned too early. I was involved in
the restructuring exercise and I remember we did it in the context
that a Soviet  style threat might re-emerge within a few years. Our
rundown plans were shaped towards completion in 1995, by which time
it was already evident that the assumptions about the world of the
future were rather different. Around that time work was put in hand
to look at how the armed forces could be operated at much lower
supporting costs while maintaining their fighting capability. That
exercise looked at putting out to private industry the support tasks
that had been traditionally undertaken by men in uniform, and also
merging facilities where the three services were duplicating
activities. The effect was quite radical for some. For example the
RAF which had been at a strength of some 93000 in 1989, was reduced
to 75000 for 1995 in the first exercise and then reduced again to
52500 by 1998 in the second exercise. The first exercise involved a
cut of 30% in combat aircraft numbers. The second involved a small
increase in combat aircraft numbers.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I tell you this to set in context the position that an incoming
government will find itself in. The Army, Navy and Air Force are
operating at much reduced manpower levels, but maintaining a spread
of activities. To give you the scale, the US Marine Corps at about
174,000 is not that much smaller than the combined British Services 
at 226,000 in total manpower, and in most measurements of combat
platforms. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The Conservative party if returned to office might be expected to
continue their approach to defence and foreign policy. They will wish
to see the UK playing a leading part in the international
organisations which they believe matter. For euroatlantic security
NATO will remain the linchpin, and the contribution of forces will
continue. The troops are of course already double-hatted for other
operations both in the home security role and the wider international
security interests. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The UK has shown that it wishes to play a full part in UN peace
support operations as part of its responsibilities as a P5 member.
This can be quite stretching. The Army for example has a total of a
little over 100,000 men. The Northern Ireland task uses up 20,000 of
these, and for many of the troops this is done as a 6 month tour away
from families. You need therefore to be able to replace them
frequently with new soldiers for each tour of 6 months. For those
that are in the Northern Ireland loop, the duty will come round every
18 months or so. If you then add on a new task of 12000 men to Bosnia
on a similar basis, the scope for further activity becomes very
constrained. I say this not to elicit a sympathy vote, but to explain
why any future government is going to have to make difficult choices
over levels on contributions for UN operations. The Gulf War brought
the army's capability in Germany to near zero. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>So does this mean that the future government will look for ways to
reduce international commitments? The Labour Party have announced
that their first action in the defence field, if elected, will be to
undertake a defence review. The term Defence Review normally sends
shudders down the spine of military officers. The defence reviews of
the past include one in 1957  which decided that fighters were no
longer necessary in the world of the nuclear deterrent, the mid 60's
review which drew back from east of Suez, and the review just prior
to the Falkland's war which saw no future role for aircraft carriers.
A review by its nature needs to be radical and so some of the given
assumptions of policy need to be changed. We have no idea what those
changes might be under a new Labour administration. The intention
they have, which is entirely welcome, is to bring into balance the
commitments and the capability, and there is an expectation that the
resources will not change greatly.  This then is the problem that the
current administration tries to tackle on a continuous basis. How
might a Labour administration be different?</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In the past, the Labour Party has included a number of
anti-nuclear activists. Interestingly, although the case may now be
easier to make, there is no interest in the leadership giving any
hope to the anti-nuclear lobby. It is therefore unlikely that we
shall see any change in the nuclear aspect of British Defence policy.
Possible reductions would be limited to readiness reductions for the
four Trident submarines. All 3 parties may wish to address this as an
issue, but the resource implications are fairly limited. The
withdrawal of tactical nuclear weapons from the inventory is
virtually complete, and when the last WE177 bomb is withdrawn from
service, there will be no more. There are beginning to be stirrings
in the academic debate as to how progress might be made towards a
non-nuclear world. Some in the UK are arguing that it is opportunity
for Britain to take a lead. Again I see little likelihood of this
under any new Government.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Again approaches to the Northern Ireland problem are agreed
between all three parties, and there is no likelihood that the next
Government, of whatever mix, will take a different view on the
provision of security forces. It has been the UK Government's
approach that terrorism must not be allowed to dictate the political
agenda. As things are at present, it seems likely that the security
requirement will be with us for some years to come. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Nor are the other elements of national security  open to much
different approach. Hong Kong will be left in the middle of the year,
and one hopes that it will be without military difficulty. In any
event there will be no more British troops stationed there. The
remaining imperial legacies are not without potential problems, but
they are relatively few in number. The Falklands absorbs a
significant effort to sustain the military presence. In Cyprus, there
is the potential for the sovereign base areas to become involved in
the Greek/Turkish disputes - but again it is difficult to see any
likely difference in approaches between the political parties. The
issue of Gibraltar is raised by Spain from time to time but does
notabsorb great military effort.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Next we must consider how they approach European security issues.
The current government is quite clear that NATO is the main vehicle
for all European security issues In their view the WEU has been
comfortably constrained within the NATO umbrella, and the European
Security Identity is seen as a somewhat vague and long term
aspiration of dubious value. Indeed the reluctance of many of the
political leadership to endorse Britain's place in the development of
the European Union means that it is unlikely that there would be a
policy change with a new Conservative Government. There has been
surprisingly little political debate over NATO enlargement. The UK
has been an active and willing supporter of the PfP programme, and
has been developing a number of bilateral relationships, and it is
also likely to align with the US over enlargement. What it is also
clear about is its lack of enthusiasm for increasing financial
contributions to fund the transition process. The geographical
position (and the less than complete enthusiasm for the European
vision in some quarters)  has meant that the UK has felt less
immediacy of problems either from the South or from the East. It has
been content to make the maintenance of a robust NATO an end in
itself. The UK policy has also been particularly shaped by the desire
to maintain the transatlantic link through NATO.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The Labour party is treading a careful path on Europe, but is
generally believed to be more sympathetic to moving forward on
development within the European Union. The third party, the Liberal
Democrats are much more overtly pro-European, and while they will not
form the next government, there are hints that they could be invited
to join a Labour administration - and in particular in the foreign
policy area. Despite greater enthusiasm for the EU, and perhaps a
wish to make progress on a common foreign and security policy for
Europe,  there is little sign of any alternative to support of NATO
as the key institution. In the past there have been sections of the
Labour party who have been profoundly anti-NATO. These are no longer
evident. So what could they achieve through their Defence Review? The
forces have been cut back to an extent where taking on new
commitments must be at the expense of old ones, and the types of
roles for UK forces seem to be broadly agreed by all 3 parties. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>There seems to be an emerging realisation that such a review will
need to be a thorough security review rather than just a review of
defence costs and capabilities. The aim should be to seek to see how
Britain could most cost-effectively contribute to European security,
and through such a contribution to wider international security.
Given the primacy of NATO over any other possible security
institution for at least the next 10 years, the focus is bound to be
on NATO. There may however be an examination of the argument for
retaining the complete range of high intensity conflict capabilities.
This will then come up against a number of industrial problems. The
European defence manufacturers have noted with some alarm how quickly
their US competitors have managed to rationalise their operations to
meet the needs of smaller markets and greater competition. The major
project with European multi-national co-operation is that of the
Eurofighter 2000 which is designed to be primarily an agile air
defence fighter, but with offensive support capability as well. It is
an expensive part of the defence budgets of the UK, Germany, and to a
lesser extent Italy and Spain. Nevertheless the industrial
implications of cancellation are very great, and it is likely that
the project will be completed. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The outgoing government is also leaving a surprisingly long set of
orders already placed. A replacement fleet of maritime reconnaissance
aircraft, a new capability with Apache attack helicopters, Tomahawk
missiles for our submarines, stand off cruise missiles for our
aircraft, new airlaunched anti-tank munitions, new tanks and a
multinational project for a new frigate. Beyond that studies are
underway for a new offensive aircraft, for new carriers, and for the
aircraft for them. Yet the biggest problem for the UK is the lack of
army manpower for internal security and UN operations. All this fails
to add up. If the Labour Party carries out a thorough review of what
it sees as its international priorities, it might begin to abandon
the US forces in miniature approach that has characterised the post
war era. This could be a very difficult policy to sell. More likely
we will see a continuation of across the board reductions, with
attempts to provide some contribution however small to international
operations. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>For the United States this will mean that the Uk will continue to
provide contributions to operations undertaken under UN auspices, but
those contributions are likely to be limited. Manpower is stretched
and the inclusion of a UK Tomahawk armed submarine, or an AWACS
aircraft may be the approach taken rather than large independent
forces for worldwide operations. If this proves to be a successful
policy, the question of whether the UK needs to keep such a broad
spread of military capability is bound to return - but probably after
the next election but one.</P>
