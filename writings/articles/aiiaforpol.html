<H3><CENTER>British Foreign Policy Priorities - A Non-Official View
</CENTER></H3>

<ADDRESS><CENTER>Sir Timothy Garden, Director, Royal Institute of
International Affairs</CENTER></ADDRESS>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>This is an interesting moment to take stock of British foreign
policy priorities. The new Labour government has been in office for
just three months and there has been a whirlwind of policy agenda
setting activity. I shall rapidly review what seem to me the
significant public pronouncements and the few examples of policy in
action, and try to draw out where, if there is, we seem to have signs
of new approaches.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>The Election &amp; Foreign Policy</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Only one aspect of the United Kingdom's foreign policy was an
election issue, and that was Britain's approach to the European
Union. Interestingly, it was more of an issue within one party, John
Major's Conservatives, than perhaps it was between the different
parties. From manifestos and from the election campaign, the voter
had a choice of strongly pro-European Liberal democrats, reasonably
positive towards Europe Labour, and a Conservative party which
spanned a range of views from the pro to those who would wish to
remove the United Kingdom from membership of the EU. For the
remainder of the international scene, the interested few could glean
pointers from the manifestos, but there was no foreign policy
discussion for the average voter.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>The New Government's Mission Statement</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>We cannot complain that the new government has been slow to set
its agenda for foreign affairs. On 12 May, just 11 days after the
election, the new Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, staged a multimedia
display in the grandest historic room of the FCO. The contrast of the
high tech launch of a Mission Statement with the grandeur of the
Locarno Suite seemed designed to symbolise a radical and new
approach. The question that needs to be answered is whether the
United Kingdom is really changing its foreign policy priorities, or
whether it is continuing much as before with rather more modern
presentational methods. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The new mission of the FCO is "to promote the national interests
of the United Kingdom and to contribute to a strong world community".
This is a mission statement which will cause little surprise, and
could be adapted to be used by Foreign Ministries around the world.
The mission statement then details four benefits for Britain that
will be secured: Security, Prosperity, Quality of Life and Mutual
Respect. But it goes further than comfortable phrases, it promises to
secure five strategic aims within the first five years of government.
 These deal with Britain's role as a leader in Europe, strengthening
the Commonwealth, making the UN more effective, using the British
Council and the BBC World Service to greater effect, and finally
strengthening relationships everywhere. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Like any good business plan, having set the mission and given the
longer term broad strategic aims, the government then sets itself
objectives for the 12 months ahead. These cover the European Union,
NATO, Hong Kong, global environmental issues, the Commonwealth, Asia,
and a catch-all for other partners. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>The Ethical Foreign Policy</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Since this agenda was set Robin Cook has staged another major
event at the FCO, where he has developed his thinking on an ethical
foreign policy. This took place just 3 weeks ago and was entitled
Human Rights into a New Century. In this major speech, he made a
strong case for the responsibility that the United kingdom has to
promote human rights. He repeated the manifesto promise to reverse
the decline in overseas aid, and trailed a new White Paper from the
newly formed Department of International Development which would set
out policies to tackle global poverty and sustainable development.  
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>He then spelled out 12 policies that "put into effect our
commitment to human rights". These ranged from direct condemnation of
Nigeria to the restoration of trade union rights at GCHQ, the signals
intelligence establishment in the UK. It must be a full time job in
the FCO keeping track of the ever increasing number of objectives,
and monitoring their satisfactory completion. One particularly
sensitive area is that of arms sales. In the speech, he stated that
"Britain will refuse to supply the equipment and weapons with which
regimes deny the demands of their peoples for human rights". This is
a carefully worded statement, which does not prohibit the supply of
weapons to regimes with poor human rights records, if those weapons
are not used for internal repression. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Monetary Union</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>At exactly the same time as the Foreign Secretary was making his
pitch on an ethical foreign policy to an audience of media and NGO
representatives at the FCO, Gordon Brown, the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, was making another speech at Chatham House with very
significant foreign policy implications. His lecture, "Britain
leading in Europe", was a plea for the public debate to start in
earnest on monetary union. While he set out the necessary conditions
for it to be in Britain's interests to join, it was clear that the
government expects to move public opinion towards favouring EMU. He
had already surprised the City by the rapidity with which he had
given the Bank of England operational independence from government.
It looks as though there will be a concerted effort to co-operate
with the development of EMU. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Public Spending Review</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The Chancellor has one other potential effect on foreign policy,
and that is in terms of the public spending policy. Yet another
review has been ordered where all departments will be looked at in a
Comprehensive Spending Review. It is not clear yet how this may
affect the foreign policy priorities, although there are those within
the FCO who hope for a rebalancing of resources, in their favour,
between defence and foreign office.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Strategic Defence Review</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>This brings us to the question of the Government's Strategic
Defence Review. The Review was a manifesto commitment and its nature
was explained in a speech by George Robertson, the Defence Secretary
on 28 May 1997. He stated that it would be "foreign policy led". He
promised to continue to base collective defence on NATO, and to
maintain both strong conventional forces and the nuclear deterrent.
He announced that there would be wide consultation including two
major seminars with outside experts. These were held in July, and for
those of us who attended it was clear from both the Foreign and
Defence Secretaries that they saw Britain continuing to "punch above
its weight".  The Review reports at the end of the year, and will be
interesting to see how it meshes with the spending review which goes
on in parallel.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Foreign Policy in Practice</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The early months of government have not just been about starting a
series of reviews, although there have been an extraordinary number.
There have also been external events to test the foreign policy
objectives. The European Union had its major meeting with the Council
in Amsterdam in June, and as usual all leaders declared it a triumph.
Commentators were less enthusiastic about the practical achievements,
but it did at least allow the new government to show that it wished
to be engaged in Europe. At the same time Tony Blair reported back to
Parliament his "success" in protecting the UK's interests over
immigration, foreign policy and defence. This seemed like little
change from the previous administration's approach.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>On the NATO front, the run-up to the Madrid conference in July had
some difficult negotiations. The aspirant new members were lobbying
hard and a division arose over whether to go for just three new
members (Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic) as the United States
wanted, or to extend it to include Slovenia and Romania as a number
of European states (in particular France) wanted. The United Kingdom
found itself in its traditional role of supporting the United States,
though in this case from the logic of the position perhaps as much as
any special relationship. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The Denver summit was an opportunity to parade the new concern for
global issues and particularly the environment. Unfortunately, it was
hardly a successful conference for advancing the cause.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The handover of Hong Kong was another event which might have
caused difficulty for the new government, particularly with its
strong push on human rights. In the event, it went off without
difficulty apart from the torrential rain. We have yet to see how
relationships with China will develop. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Arms sales contracts are also events which test the seriousness of
the Labour government's approach to ethical foreign policy. An early
start was made with the banning of landmines. Although the
effectiveness of this was reduced by allowing their retention by
British forces for the next few years, for use in emergency with
ministerial approval. A tough line was taken on all trading with
Burma. Last week, the decision on sales to Indonesia were announced.
Hawk aircraft (very expensive) are apparently allowable, and to
greater surprise so were armoured vehicles. </P>

<H3>Changes in Style or Content?</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>So what are we to deduce from this early evidence? Are there any
real changes in Britain's foreign policy, or is it just a change in
style? Not surprisingly the most obvious change is in its approach to
the European Union. There seems to be a reasonably strong feeling
throughout the leadership that it is in Britain's best long term
interests to be in Europe and acting as a leading nation. This will
include relatively early membership of monetary union if it comes
about and is successful. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The most interesting aspect of foreign policy that strikes the
writer is the virtual absence of the United States from the
documents. The FCO Web site still promotes the transatlantic
relationship as a key theme, but it is a shadow of the line taken by
Malcolm Rifkind, the previous Foreign Secretary. We had long grown
used to Foreign Policy statements starting with a ritual reminder of
the particular place that the United States has with respect to
Britain. For some, it was that relationship which was damaging to
Britain's attempts to become more European. Yet in security matters,
NATO (and thus the United States) is seen as critical. It was perhaps
strange that so little support came from the new government towards a
European defence policy development at Amsterdam. Yet at the same
time Tony Blair is obviously comfortable bathing in the reflected
glory of a close relationship with the US President at a personal
level.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>At present we have a government that has set down some worthy
markers, yet policy whether in arms sales, relationship with the US,
or with China, or furthering of the Maastricht treaty does not seem
to have changed greatly. It will  work hard on the electorate to move
them towards a more pro-European frame of mind. Its relationship with
Asia is likely to continue the policy of co-operation of its
predecessor, and there seems little sign that a new ethical approach
will affect commerce greatly. Australia remains significant to the
United Kingdom. Again, the visit of the Prime Minister to London so
soon after the election was a happy piece of timing. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Who Pays?</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The big question that remains is where the funding for more
overseas aid, more British Council, more BBC World Service, less
overstretch in the armed forces, and greater involvement in the
international community will come from. I shall be surprised if the
strategic spending review leads to the conclusion that Defence and
the Foreign Office are going to get more resources.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>As a footnote to this first look at how the new government is
shaping its foreign policy priorities, perhaps I should mention an
article in the Guardian of 26 July, entitled "Blair as wizard of Oz".
It suggested that Tony Blair might be an Australian at heart: not in
awe of the past; a meritocrat; a doer and a practical,
problem-solving politician, who is simply happy making his own
history. If that is true then he should have the understanding of the
audience at this conference as he tries to square the circle between
idealism and the real world.</P>
