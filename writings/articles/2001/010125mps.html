			<h3>Europe After Nice - Defence Issues</h3>
			<p><i>Briefing for MPs - 25 January 2001</i></p>

			<p>The process that began at St Malo in December 1998, when France and the UK agreed the need for a better European capability to undertake the &quot;Petersberg Tasks&quot;, reached a significant milestone at the Nice summit.  The series of bilateral meetings, WEU and EU summits for the past two years produced a proposal for a capability of up to 60,000 troops with associated air and naval support. The forces should be ready deployable within two months and sustainable for up to one year. The nature of the force was agreed at Helsinki in December 1999, and the detailed contributions were worked out in Brussels just before the Nice Summit. The capability is required to be available by 2003.</p>
			<p>For the UK, the British Government has put a sizable offer on the table. The army will provide either an Armoured or Mechanised brigade, each of which could be sustained for at least a year; or an Air Assault brigade which would be deployed for up to six months. Combat Support enabling capabilities such as Artillery, and Short Range Air Defence, and Attack Helicopters could be deployed in addition. The Navy has committed an aircraft carrier, two nuclear powered submarines, four destroyers/frigates, support vessels; and an amphibious task group, including one helicopter landing platform and an amphibious brigade. The aircraft carrier, helicopter landing platform and submarines could not necessarily be sustained continuously for a whole year. In the air, we have offered up to 72 combat aircraft (including Sea Harriers), with associated support aircraft including strategic transport. This number would be available for six months to cover initial theatre entry. For a longer term commitment the total would reduce.</p>
			<p>The major issue that has arisen after Nice has been the question of how this new structure fits in with NATO. While NATO had encouraged the move towards a better European capability at its April 1999 summit in Washington, there are concerns about duplication of effort between the EU and itself. The Washington summit had also identified a long list of major capability shortfalls in the Defence Capabilities Initiative (DCI). The new EU capability will improve reaction times and ensure forces are trained for the new roles of the post Cold War world. It will not of itself provide the needed airlift, sealift, air-to-air refuelling, intelligence, reconnaissance, command and control, communication, suppression of enemy air defence, precision weapons and the many other bits of kit that Europe needs both for European operations and for use in NATO. It is not clear how Europe is going to make available the extra resources for these requirements.</p>
			<p>There are also concerns about how the European NATO members who do not belong to the EU fit in. Of these, Turkey is making life difficult for the EU. The EU plans will depend on the availability of key resources from NATO, but Turkey can effectively veto such an arrangement. The current issue which is causing these sorts of difficulty is over the planning arrangements. NATO seeks to remain the planning agency for the new EU capability.</p>
			<p>Finally, the new administration in the United States is likely to have an effect on European defence developments. There are questions over their long term commitment of troops in the Balkans. The National Missile Defence proposals are causing political difficulties in Europe. Further enlargement of NATO may become an issue during the year.  </p>
