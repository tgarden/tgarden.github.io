<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The news that all 12 Royal Navy nuclear
powered attack submarines have been taken out of service because of a
possible mechanical defect is serious. A small crack in the reactor
coolant pipe of HMS Tireless has kept it at Gibraltar since May. It
had already become a difficult political issue between the UK and
Gibraltar. The MOD had given repeated assurances that the
rectification work necessary was entirely safe, but the local
residents remained concerned. That work seems now to have revealed a
more serious failure in the piping, and one which might be present in
the other submarines using similar nuclear reactors.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Royal Navy in the mid 90's opted to
dispose of its last conventional powered submarines: four brand new
Upholder class boats. At the time, there were those who expressed
doubts about the wisdom of losing this capability. However there were
arguments in the post Cold War reshaping of forces for reducing the
number of different types of submarine to be supported, and the
Upholder was felt to have less relevance to future operations. Since
then the remaining nuclear powered attack submarines were to have
been progressively fitted with Tomahawk cruise missiles. The first
use of this capability was seen when HMS Splendid fired a fair part
of the UK stock of cruise missiles during the Kosovo air campaign
earlier this year. The attack submarines also have an important role
in protecting the Trident nuclear deterrent boats as they go on
patrol. The lack of any substitute for this task is perhaps the most
critical aspect of what is a serious problem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">It is probably impossible to estimate how
long this problem will last. It may be that HMS Tireless turns out to
be the only submarine with a problem, and that the others can be
returned to service after a relatively rapid check. However, if the
cracks are more widespread, availability of servicing facilities will
become a critical issue. This is a salutary reminder of the dangers
of cutting back on breadth of capability to the extent that a single
failure can cripple a complete role. An element of redundancy is a
price worth paying in key defence areas. It might have been better to
retain the Upholders, even if that meant cutting back on the nuclear
powered fleet.</FONT></P>
