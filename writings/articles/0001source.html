<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	It has been a long wait for the annual
Defence White Paper. The general election of May 1997 came right in
the middle of the normal publication cycle for the Ministry of
Defence. The new government rapidly confirmed its intention to
conduct a full scale defence review. Although it had  promised to
complete the Review within 6 months of the election, it was July 1998
before the findings were published. Again, the annual White Paper was
lost in the frenetic activity of the SDR. As luck would have it, the
Kosovo operation managed to interfere with the 1999 White Paper.
Finally, after over three and half years, Cm 4446 hit the streets
just before Christmas to almost total public lack of interest.

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Just a brief comparison of this document
with its 1996 predecessor (Cm 3223) shows how times have changed. In
1996, 148 pages with 731 paragraphs, 5 annexes and a comprehensive
index and glossary (all in small typeface) were needed to describe a
fairly routine year. In 1999 the White paper runs to 58 large
typeface pages (of which 10 are either blank or full page
photographs), 139 paragraphs and it has no index or glossary. It is
not just that  there are surprisingly few words to cover the missing
3 years or to review one of the more exciting periods for action by
British forces, the analysis is amazingly shallow. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The opening introduction by Geoffrey Hoon
should have been an opportunity for the new Secretary of State to put
his personal stamp on the work of his Department. The succession of
initiatives by the Prime Minister on European Defence would have
seemed to be the perfect backdrop for a piece showing the new Defence
Secretary's vision for the future. Instead, his introduction does a
chapter by chapter precis of what his officials have produced for
him. Nowhere is there any indication that he has a personal view on
defence policy. The closest that we get is his short section entitled
"Beyond the Strategic Defence Review". In this he offers three
issues: modernising the Civil Service; the Defence Electronic
Commerce Service; and joined-up working across Government
departments. These three areas may be on message, but they hardly
constitute a vision.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Defence White Papers have always been as
much public relations documents as cold analysis of the future
defence programme. However, they are formal presentations to
Parliament, and as such provide an opportunity to announce changes to
assumptions and to future plans. As Michael Portillo said in his
introduction to the 1996 edition: "This Statement contains a wealth
of detailed information. I hope that it contributes to informed
debate on the defence of our country". It would be a vain hope for
its 1999 successor. The first two chapters deal with the security
context. The most interesting aspect is that the title of  the second
chapter is "NATO  and European Defence". The commitment agreed to at
the Helsinki European Council,  earlier in December, for a pool of 15
 European deployable brigades with appropriate air and naval support
is reported, and it is immediately made clear that "This is not a
European Army." </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The third chapter is about the front line
and fills in a few dates for implementation of the SDR Joint force
capabilities. The Defence Medical Services get a rather longer
section than  do the Royal Navy, the Army or the Royal Air Force
(called Naval Forces, Ground Forces and Air Forces in this White
Paper). Factual detail about equipment programmes is very sparse in
this Chapter. However, we learn that the aircraft carrier assessment
phase will be complete in 2003; the planned number of mine
countermeasures vessels will be reduced by 3 to 22; and that the
Tornado GR4 will be in service until around 2020, by which time it
will have been in Service for over 40 years.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The fourth and longest chapter of the
White Paper is about people in defence. This is an appraisal of what
has been done, and what is planned to be done, for both military and
civilian personnel.  The Statement claims that the first priority was
to reduce overstretch. This may be a good sound bite, but sits ill
with the number of new commitments that the Government has taken on
with enthusiasm. While the paper gives the figures for recent
reductions in  force numbers in Kosovo, the Gulf and the Falklands,
it says nothing of the new commitments to East Timor, to the UN rapid
deployment capability, and the implications of the new European rapid
deployment force.  Nor does the paper give the hard figures about
recruitment and retention which would allow the reader to make a
judgment.   A quarter of the chapter is taken up by homosexuality and
equal opportunities issues. Welcome as this attempt to drag the armed
forces into the 20th Century is, I doubt that these parts will be
universally welcomed either in  Parliament or among the troops.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	The chapter on defence support does little
more than reassure the reader that all is going well in procurement,
logistics, research and the defence estates management. The Defence
Select committee should probe these assertions. In a newly published
book on Smart Procurement (Dancing with the Dinosaur by Bill Kincaid,
UK Defence Forum December 1999), the author reports "Genuine progress
is relatively sparse". </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	When I took an MOD official to task over
the lack of substance in the White Paper, he was surprised. Perhaps
it is so long since the last proper Statement on the Defence
Estimates that gloss and spin are seen as more important than serious
analysis. The price to be paid is lack of interest by the public, and
this in the end will be damaging to the armed forces and defence
resourcing. At the same time  as the White Paper was published, the
MOD brought out its 1998/99  Departmental Performance Report. We will
look at what that has to offer the reader next month.</FONT></P>
