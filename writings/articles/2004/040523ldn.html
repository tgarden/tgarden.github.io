			<h4><b>Iraq:Looking into the Abyss</b></h4>

			<p>The clock is ticking away with barely a month left now until the new arrangements for governing Iraq need to be up and running. The announcement of the makeup of the new transitional government is imminent. Already the US and UK are making it clear that they will need exemption from Iraqi prosecution for their forces after 30 June. There will be many other detailed arrangements that will have to be agreed in the short time that remains. The United Nations special representative, Lahkdar Brahimi, has been doing heroic work in trying to find volunteers for the new temporary governing body. Ideally they need to be seen as both representative and lacking in personal political ambition. They will also need to be courageous given the continuing targeting of members of the current Governing Council. It is looking as though the final selection may not see that many new faces.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>This new interim authority has a challenging time ahead. There will need to be elections for a transitional government in January next year, followed by agreement on a new constitution and full democratic elections by the end of 2005. In parallel with the founding of the new Iraqi democratic institutions, the rebuilding of the economy has equal urgency. For both of these to be possible, the violence has to be kept under control.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>By any measure, the security situation is now very bad. The Coalition spin doctors explain that insurgency is limited to a few difficult urban areas. Yet, a former commander in chief of US Central Command, General Joseph Hoar, told the Senate foreign relations committee last week: &quot;I believe we are absolutely on the brink of failure. We are looking into the abyss.&quot; The serial mismanagement and incompetence, that has characterised the Pentagon approach to nation-building in Iraq,&nbsp; has hit new depths over the last month. The leader of the Governing Council is killed by a bomber while queuing to get into the occupying forces headquarters. Women and children at a wedding party are among 40 left dead after a disproportionate US military action against insurgents near the Syrian border. The daily publication of new obscene photographs and videos from&nbsp; the Abu Ghraib prison abuse&nbsp; ensure that all the occupying forces are seen increasingly as oppressors.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>For Britain, there are difficult decisions to make. It is clear that the pressure is on to provide more troops. British forces are continuing to do a good job. Where there are allegations of illegal actions against them, they are being investigated.&nbsp; The overwhelming impression is of professional forces doing their best to get their sector of Iraq functioning on its own again. The stark differences in approach between British and American forces has led to tensions between them. It would now be very difficult for them to conduct joint ground operations. The disproportionate use of force, particularly from US air power, is rightly seen as counterproductive by the British in their attempts to win the trust of the local community.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>As the violence increases - and it will - the need for more forces will become urgent.&nbsp; Diplomacy for a UN resolution to legitimise the process seems to be going reasonably well. However, even with consensus in the UN Security Council, it is unlikely that many new countries will volunteer to provide troops to get caught in the Iraqi mangle.&nbsp; A bad omen was Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, Nato's secretary-general, saying last week that the much less controversial stabilising mission in Afghanistan is close to failure for lack of forces. In Britain, the call for more troop deployments comes as the fire fighters gear themselves up for another bout of industrial action. The imminent announcements of a round of serious defence savings will hardly make the Services feel valued. Geoff Hoon must be hoping he will be part of a Summer reshuffle.</p>
