			<h3><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">Introduction</font></h3>
			<p><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">I have been asked to look at the narrow, but increasingly important aspect of security for European energy supplies: that of physical security. In talking of physical security, I shall include the threats from cyber attacks as well as the use of explosives and other measures to destroy infrastructure. The vast network from well head to petrol station provides an attractive set of potential targets to any enemy.  There are no certainties, only risks. Defensive and preventative measures need to be taken at the company, state, region and international level. Such protective measures may themselves cause disruption to delivery systems, and will certainly involve extra costs. The balance between risks and costs remains difficult.<br>
					<br>
					Oil and energy supplies and prices have been sensitive to conflict even when they are not targeted directly. The effect tends to be short lived. Supplies may be disturbed by the prospect of conflict as states increase stockpiles as a precaution. They may be disrupted during a war as both sources and supply lines are at risk of attack. And they maybe disrupted after a war because of damage to infrastructure. But we have other threats to physical security now in the age of international terrorism and widespread crime, and I will address all these aspects.<br>
					<br>
					The aim is to make you reflect on the risks, ask what more can and should be done, and who should take the action.</font></p>
			<h3><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">Terrorism and Oil Security </font></h3>
			<p><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">The events of 11 September have brought a realisation that non-State actors can wreak havoc on the economies of States. The attack on the US was strategic in nature, and al-Qaeda is set on targeting the US and its allies as major economic powers. The developed world offers a lucrative target set to determined terrorists. While the World Trade Centre was a key financial centre as well as a symbolic target, we must expect our dependence on oil and gas to be a focus for future attacks. To Osama bin Laden and his followers, the energy industry provides a particularly attractive target. The infrastructure with pipelines and tankers over vast distances provide opportunities to act fairly fragile installations which are difficult to protect. The effect can not only be on the Western economies, but also on the stability of the middle eastern regimes. The effects are dramatic and draw publicity.<br>
					<br>
					It is not my intention to provide a menu of choices for terrorist organisations. We can point to the explosion of the French tanker off Yemen. It gives a good example of what is possible. But those involved in counter-terrorism must look at the vulnerabilities in the whole of the energy supply chain. Saddam Hussein set fire to the Kuwaiti production facilities and caused great damage to the environment and delay in getting the oilfields back in action. They will be targets for future terrorists. We are to an extent seeing this in post-conflict Iraq. Oil and gas are not just vulnerable when in tankers; the long pipelines in being and planned will require constant protection. The consumer nations with their vulnerable refineries, often near centres of population, also need to think through the defences. The national economic implications of uncertain supply and destruction of major infrastructure  could be considerable. There may be a knock on effect following terror attacks that make new plans for refineries, terminals an pipelines domestically more difficult. <br>
					<br>
					Of course energy is only one of the possible targets for terrorists. The killing in Bali shows that other economic targets (in this case tourism) are options for the terrorist. This makes the problem of prevention and intelligence both more important and more difficult. </font></p>
			<h3><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">Crime/Anarchy</font></h3>
			<p><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">Before turning to the more serious worries about conflict, I would just wish to mention the problem of anarchy and crime particularly in failing states. We have seen in post conflict Iraq that a combination of smuggling and stealing of infrastructure such as copper wire has had a large scale effect on energy availability. It is an area which was not thought through in the war planning and perhaps needs greater attention in future.</font></p>
			<h3><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">Defending the Oil Producers </font></h3>
			<p><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">The international community has military capabilities to defend friendly oil producing countries from the threat of attack by their neighbours or elsewhere. Kuwait was invaded by Iraq. At one level this was a simple UN authorised military operation to oust the invader. However, few doubt that the alacrity with which the ad hoc coalition was built up owed much to the fear of control by Iraq of Kuwait's vast oil supplies. There was also an implicit threat to Saudi Arabia. <br>
					<br>
					The major energy consumers have therefore demonstrated both a will and a capability to defend their energy supplies when threatened. Since the Gulf War, the size of western military forces have decreased significantly (by around 40% in raw numbers). However, the capability of the US with a number of European states greatly exceeds any potential invader of a major oil producing state. Indeed, many countries have been reshaping their forces better to be able to conduct these sorts of operations. Although US strategy in the war this year was not directly about energy, there seems little doubt that the attention to Iraq had an energy supply dimension to it. </font></p>
			<h3><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">Stabilising Oil Producers </font></h3>
			<p><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">It seems unfortunate that there is something of a correlation between political instability and the geological formation necessary for oil reserves. Of course in some countries, the rapid arrival of oil wealth may have caused some of the internal tensions. There is certainly a military security aspect to the foreign policy aims of the consumers in respect of trying to bolster friendly regimes among the oil producers. <br>
					<br>
					This support can of course backfire, as it did so spectacularly with the Shah of Iran. The support of unpopular regimes by western powers can give rise to long term antipathy among the next generation of rulers. Nevertheless, the economic drivers both of security of energy supply, but also to recirculate the petro dollars through exports remain uppermost in foreign policy thinking. The arms sales and military support are big money earners from countries like Saudi Arabia, but also in the Gulf States. Unfortunately in some cases corruption associated with arms sales can do more to undermine internal stability. It is important that as much effort goes into improving good governance in oil producing states as goes into lucrative, but perhaps unnecessary, arms contracts. </font></p>
			<h3><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">International Organisations and the Strategy</font></h3>
			<p><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">From wherever the threat to the physical security of the energy supply systems comes,  the key to successful countermeasures is good intelligence. Yet the international co-operation needed for countering al-Qaeda is problematic. US/European/Middle Eastern/North African intelligence co-operation does not come without a lot of trust and hard work.<br>
					<br>
					The new US national strategy looks at pre-emptive action where necessary to sustain the US national interest. This does call into question how the range of international institutions can help with physical security of oil supplies. The EU has had some successes in intelligence co-operation between members, and has recognised the need fro a strategic approach. NATO is finding consensus betweens its members much more difficult, and may not be the organisation best suited to countering the threats. Its Mediterranean Dialogue has produced little that is useful in this area.  The UN has an important role to play in reducing the causes of terrorism, but has a hard time in trying to bridge the strategic divisions between the various players.</font></p>
			<h3><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">Replacement Energy sources &amp; Security </font></h3>
			<p><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">Finally, let me address the question of moving away from oil and gas, or at least reducing dependence. There are many reasons to do this. Security is one, the environment another. Yet we have to be careful that we don not open new vulnerabilities. A move to greater use of nuclear energy would provide more potential targets for terrorists, and also increase the difficulty of controlling nuclear material. </font></p>
			<h3><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">Conclusion </font></h3>
			<p><font size="-2" face="verdana,helvetica,sans-serif">The military/physical security aspects of maintaining oil security can only be considered as one part of the overall picture. Indeed too much focus on military aspects can be counter-productive in the ling term. Intelligence must remain the key element for future security of energy supplies. The prospects are not good as the demands increase, and the non state intervention becomes more targeted. The whole line from oil/gas extraction through processing and delivery is vulnerable. This is true at home as well as abroad. All of this reinforces the pressure to find alternative sustainable energy sources and also to reduce demand by improving efficiency. <br>
