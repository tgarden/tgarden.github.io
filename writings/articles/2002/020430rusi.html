			<p>When one looks at security issues around the Mediterranean, it rapidly becomes clear that some of the dangers stem from a series of concerns that neighbouring states have about one another; and that this is heightened by internal tensions . The race for weapons of mass destruction capability among some is accelerated by the fear that potentially hostile powers may gain an overwhelming advantage. When we consider the region we cannot confine our thinking to just littoral states. To some extent, the WMD delivery system is more important in this debate than the particular advances in nuclear, biological and chemical weapon engineering. To add a further degree of complexity, we have the potential for non state actors to use WMD either in or from the region. In the short time available, I can only indicate my main areas of concern, and suggest the best security approach that NATO might be able to take to improve prospects.<br>
				<br>
				First the key states with a known nuclear weapon capability that might be used in the region are the US, UK, France, Russia and Israel. When discussing WMD, we need to keep in mind those held by  the five nuclear powers as well as those held or being developed by others. How do these capabilities affect regional stability? Israel would argue that its nuclear weapons provide a deterrent against attack by WMD or overwhelming conventional force in an area with virtually no strategic depth. Its Arab neighbours are concerned to be threatened by nuclear capability without their own ability to deter. Lacking an easy road to nuclear weapons capability, they may devote more attention to biological and chemical weapons. This gives a strategic rationale for Iraq, Iran, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Egypt to pursue such capabilities. The longer term aim must be to reduce this dependence on nuclear and WMD capability. <br>
				<br>
				In terms of missile delivery systems, the nations  either operating or developing capabilities for missiles of over 500km range are: the 5 nuclear weapon states, India, Iran, Iraq, Israel, N Korea, Libya, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Taiwan. All of the proliferators are in reaction to regional rather than global balances of power, although gaining a nuclear capability would change their status within the international community. Iran is active in its development of both cruise and  ballistic missiles. Iraq can do little about longer range missiles while UN sanctions continue. Libya has tried unsuccessfully to obtain strategic missile technology. <br>
				<br>
				The focus for US attention has been on Iraq. It has a proven record of trying to develop a range of WMD, and it has used chemical weapons in recent times. There is little prospect of its developing a nuclear capability while current international constraints continue. However, illegal procurement of nuclear material from elsewhere cannot be discounted. It probably has both chemical and biological agents available. It  has a very limited ability to deliver such weapons in a normal state to state war. It seems unlikely that the regime would wish to give assistance to Islamic fundamentalist groups. The current mixture of sanctions and military policing of the air continues to restrict the opportunities for Iraq to break out. There are three new dimensions to add to this analysis. First is the intention of the US to change the regime at some time in the relatively near future. Second is the explicit declaration by both the US and the UK that their nuclear weapons might be used in response to a chemical or other WMD attack on their troops. Third is the uncertainty over how the Israel-Palestine dispute will  play out. The most likely time for any state to use WMD is when it believes that its survival is in doubt. There is a difficult judgement to make about future military action in Iraq. It may succeed in pre-empting the production of WMD capability, but it may encourage the use of any such capability that currently exists. The optimum strategy would appear to be to use any military operation as a route to inserting rigorous UN inspection rather than regime change. This debate is likely to a be a difficult one within NATO.<br>
				<br>
				While the state to state WMD problem remains, and may get worse, in the region, the more difficult problem is that of non-state actors. The attacks of 11 September were neither mounted by a Mediterranean state nor delivered against such a state. Yet the security problems of the region contribute to making such attacks possible. The network of fanatical Islamic terrorists  draws strength from the troubles of the region. Algeria, Egypt and Saudi Arabia have large populations who are sympathetic to anti-Western philosophies. The repressive means that have been used in a number of countries against dissident factions has only served to recruit more to extremism. The West therefore possibly faces three different types of security threats: al-Qaeda type movements;  despairing Palestinian style suicide bombers; and perhaps a post attack Iraq responding with state sponsored agents. The 11 September al-Qaeda type movement sees destruction of the West and its way of life as an aim in itself.  For all three types of terrorist, the use of WMD (or methods which cause mass casualties) is seen as more effective. None of them are likely to be deterred by  counter threats. The most effective methods to be adopted will be the traditional  counter terrorist intelligence, police and protective measures. None of these have been  major roles for NATO in the past. It is not clear  that they will be most naturally roles for NATO in the future.<br>
				<br>
				So what is the part that NATO should play in this messy security arena? NATO has a continuing role to provide state to state deterrence against attack of any of its members by WMD from anywhere in the region. Beyond that, its best role may be in the various ways that it can promote stability. The problems stem from inequalities and injustices. NATO has done a good job at making the conditions for rebuilding trust in the Balkans. The Mediterranean dialogue can be used as a vehicle to promote trust. It may be that if a settlement of the Israel-Palestine situation can be agreed, NATO might have a role in policing such an agreement. It is unlikely that the USA will want NATO to carry out offensive military operations in the region, and it is equally unlikely that its members could agree on such a role. NATO will remain important in making it possible for nations to operate together, but its day of being in the driving seat are probably over.</p>
